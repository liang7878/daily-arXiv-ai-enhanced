### [1] [AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)
*Jarosław A. Chudziak,Adam Kostka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有AI辅导系统有局限性，研究提出新型多智能体AI辅导平台助力数学教学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅导系统存在反应式的局限性，在数学领域发展不足，需实现结构化、个性化和工具辅助的学习体验。

Method: 引入结合自适应和个性化反馈、结构化课程生成及教科书知识检索的新型多智能体AI辅导平台。

Result: 该系统让学生能学习新主题、针对薄弱点学习、有效备考和进行无限个性化练习。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新平台将教学智能体和AI驱动组件结合，为人工智能教育领域带来模块化且有效的数学教学系统。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强模拟环境以复现真实驾驶员行为对自动驾驶技术发展至关重要，以往相关工作存在局限。

Result: 模型在真实数据集上验证，对复杂交互有良好再现性，集成进高保真模拟环境有足够计算时间效率。

Conclusion: 所提模型可用于大规模模拟以支持自动驾驶车辆发展。

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Method: 提出基于'What'和'How'的分类法对超250篇论文进行综述。

Result: 完成对超250篇论文的综述，提出相关领域。

Conclusion: 确定了XRL领域的一些需求。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自动化设计迭代框架，结合RL代理和LMM改进游戏设计，展示LMM可迭代完善游戏机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成系统难以理解游戏静态规则和内容如何转化为动态玩家行为，需填补这一差距。

Method: 将进行游戏测试的强化学习（RL）代理与基于代理行为修改游戏的大模态模型（LMM）配对，在循环中RL玩家完成多轮游戏，LMM设计师接收目标和配置，分析游戏轨迹并修改配置。

Result: LMM可以基于RL代理提供的行为轨迹迭代完善游戏机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助游戏设计提供了实用、可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较白盒和黑盒监测方式对AI助手欺骗检测，发现现有欺骗探测器有较弱但积极的黑盒到白盒性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性分类器（欺骗探测器）检测AI助手欺骗的有效性及抗反制策略能力不明，需进一步研究。

Method: 比较白盒监测（可访问标记级探测激活）和黑盒监测（不可访问），以白盒监测相对黑盒监测的性能提升来对欺骗探测器进行基准测试。

Result: 现有欺骗探测器有较弱但令人鼓舞的黑盒到白盒性能提升。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但从结果可推测现有欺骗探测器有一定价值，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

### [6] [Imitating Mistakes in a Learning Companion AI Agent for Online Peer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12801)
*Sosui Moribe,Taketoshi Ushiama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究旨在开发能随时随地实现同伴学习的AI学习伙伴，以英语写作为例验证方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同伴学习受关注但人类同伴学习有局限，需同水平伙伴，开发AI伙伴可解决问题

Method: 假设同水平学习者会犯同样错误，以英语写作为具体例子进行验证

Result: 摘要未提及

Conclusion: 摘要未提及

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Result: 提出了新的评估框架和基于新颖游戏的基准测试范式。

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论。

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Result: 给出了首个将操纵风险纳入AI安全治理的系统方法。

Conclusion: 为AI公司在部署前评估和缓解操纵威胁提供具体基础。

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有强化学习提升大语言模型数学推理能力可能是过拟合，提出VAR - MATH评估框架，实验显示模型在新评估下性能下降，表明现有方法泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究强化学习提升大语言模型数学推理能力是真实推理还是过拟合，发现现有评估协议存在基准污染和评估脆弱问题。

Method: 引入VAR - MATH符号评估框架，将固定数值问题转化为符号模板，要求模型解决多个实例。

Result: RL训练的模型在VAR - AMC23和VAR - AIME24上性能大幅下降，小模型平均降幅分别为48.0%和58.3%。

Conclusion: VAR - MATH提供了一种有原则、抗污染的数学推理评估范式，许多现有RL方法依赖表面启发式，泛化能力差。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过将概率事件演算（PEC）领域形式化转换为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），弥补了PEC缺乏目标导向推理机制的不足，扩展其能力并保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率事件演算（PEC）缺乏目标导向推理机制，本文旨在弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 将PEC领域形式化转换为MDP，引入“行动情况”概念以保留PEC灵活的行动语义，并将MDP的算法和理论工具应用于PEC。

Result: 实现了支持时间推理任务和目标驱动规划，能将学习到的策略映射回人类可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: 在保持可解释性的同时扩展了PEC的能力。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

Abstract: The study "Prediction of Highway Traffic Flow Based on Artificial
Intelligence Algorithms Using California Traffic Data" presents a machine
learning-based traffic flow prediction model to address global traffic
congestion issues. The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from
California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022,
analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino
Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals
ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance
metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally
with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to
contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic
management.

Motivation: 现有语言模型处理复杂问题时存在错误传播和知识整合问题，ProbTree框架有静态实现的局限性，需改进树结构推理方法。

Method: 提出动态强化学习框架，基于实时置信度估计增量构建推理树，学习动作选择的最优策略。

Result: 在保持ProbTree概率严谨性的同时，通过选择性扩展和资源集中分配提高了解决方案质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 建立了新的树结构推理范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和现实问答系统所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

*Matthew E. Brophy*

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）促使重新审视评估人工道德主体（AMAs）的哲学标准，本文提出一套新的功能标准并通过场景展示其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强大但不透明的LLMs出现，使基于透明架构假设的传统伦理标准不再适用，需要修订评估标准。

Method: 结合技术哲学核心主题，提出一套包含十个功能标准的评估准则，并以自动驾驶公共汽车的假设场景为例进行说明。

Result: 提出了评估基于LLM的人工道德主体的十个功能标准，即道德一致性、情境敏感性等。

Conclusion: 这些标准可引导AMAs更好地与社会融合，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

Method: 提出GEA，即生成式能源竞技场，在评估过程中纳入模型能耗信息。

Result: 对于大多数问题，用户了解能耗后倾向小而节能的模型。

Conclusion: 在大多数用户交互中，复杂且表现优的模型额外成本和能耗未显著提升响应质量，不足以证明其使用合理性。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Motivation: LPBF制造的金属零件易出现内部缺陷和几何不准确问题，部分源于熔池变化。

Method: 提出向量级前馈控制框架，通过两个耦合轻量级模型（有限差分热模型和降阶分析熔池模型）解耦热行为与熔池物理，分别校准模型并在复杂3D几何体上验证。

Result: 前馈向量级激光功率调度使关键尺寸几何误差降低62%，整体孔隙率降低16.5%，光电二极管变化平均降低6.8%。

Conclusion: 该模块化、数据高效的方法能主动补偿热效应，显著提高零件质量，计算高效且易扩展到其他材料和机器。

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing technique that
has gained popularity thanks to its ability to produce geometrically complex,
fully dense metal parts. However, these parts are prone to internal defects and
geometric inaccuracies, stemming in part from variations in the melt pool. This
paper proposes a novel vector-level feedforward control framework for
regulating melt pool area in LPBF. By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior
from small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic
prediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it. This is done
by operating on two coupled lightweight models: a finite-difference thermal
model that efficiently captures vector-level temperature fields and a
reduced-order, analytical melt pool model. Each model is calibrated separately
with minimal single-track and 2D experiments, and the framework is validated on
a complex 3D geometry in both Inconel 718 and 316L stainless steel. Results
showed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric
inaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode
variation by 6.8% on average. Overall, this modular, data-efficient approach
demonstrates that proactively compensating for known thermal effects can
significantly improve part quality while remaining computationally efficient
and readily extensible to other materials and machines.

Abstract: With the growing demand for renewable energy, countries are accelerating the
construction of photovoltaic (PV) power stations. However, accurately
forecasting power data for newly constructed PV stations is extremely
challenging due to limited data availability. To this end, we propose a novel
interpretable dynamic selection network (IDS-Net) based on feature information
fusion to achieve accurate few-shot prediction. This transfer learning
framework primarily consists of two parts. In the first stage, we pre-train on
the large dataset, utilizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select the
source domain dataset most similar to the target domain data distribution.
Subsequently, the ReliefF algorithm is utilized for feature selection, reducing
the influence of feature redundancy. Then, the Hampel Identifier (HI) is used
for training dataset outlier correction. In the IDS-Net model, we first obtain
the initial extracted features from a pool of predictive models. Following
this, two separate weighting channels are utilized to determine the
interpretable weights for each sub-model and the adaptive selection outcomes,
respectively. Subsequently, the extracted feature results from each sub-model
are multiplied by their corresponding weights and then summed to obtain the
weighted extracted features. Then, we perform cross-embedding on the additional
features and fuse them with the extracted weighted features. This fused
information is then passed through the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) layer to
obtain predictions. In the second stage, we design an end-to-end adaptive
transfer learning strategy to obtain the final prediction results on the target
dataset. We validate the transfer learning process using two PV power datasets
from Hebei province, China, to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
of our framework and transfer learning strategy.

traditional reinforcement learning methods often fail to deliver breakthrough

the performance of classical A3C versus quantum A3C algorithms, and (2) the
impact of incorporating LSTM-based predictions of the following week's economic
trends on learning outcomes. The experimental framework adopts a custom
Gymnasium-compatible trading environment, simulating discrete trading actions
and evaluating rewards based on portfolio feedback. Experimental results show
that quantum models - especially when combined with predictive signals -
demonstrate superior performance and stability under noisy financial
conditions, even with shallow quantum circuit depth.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated

characterized by its systematic CoT synthesis optimization. We first introduce
a comprehensive CoT synthesis pipeline featuring Multi-perspective Knowledge

deep financial reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, a systematic investigation,
termed CoT Cube, is conducted to analyze critical factors that influence CoT
effectiveness, such as necessity, length and synthesizer, yielding valuable
insights for high-quality financial CoT construction. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on our Agentar-DeepFinance-300K achieve significant
improvements on financial benchmarks. We publicly release
Agentar-DeepFinance-300K , hoping to advance the research in financial

Conclusion: 质疑了股票定价理论中传统的通胀和贬值对冲假设，强调基于股票保护的局限性及危机时需因地制宜的策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which local public equity indices can
statistically hedge real purchasing power loss during compounded structural
macro-financial collapses in emerging markets. We employ a non-linear
multiplicative real return calculations consistent with Fisher-parity logics
for both domestic and foreign investors with a principled quantile regression,
tail dependence copula analysis, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to
assess the explanatory power of macro variables. The analysis focuses on three
recent and data-accessible exemplary collapse episodes: Turkey (2018), Nigeria
(2020), and Pakistan (2021). Such cases, selected to align with post-2018
improvements in data standardization and crisis comparability, span varied
monetary regimes and crisis triggers. Our tail-focused modeling reveals a
systematic breakdown in public-equity-based purchasing power protection
precisely during simultaneous macroeconomic and monetary dislocations when such
protection is most needed. The findings call into question conventional
inflation and devaluation hedge presumptions in equity pricing theory,
emphasizing the limitations of equity-based protection and the need for
context-sensitive strategies during compounded macro-financial distress.

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

Conclusion: rel - HNN能有效捕捉关系数据的细粒度关系，拆分并行训练算法可提高训练效率。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

Abstract: Compared to frequent pattern mining, sequential pattern mining emphasizes the
temporal aspect and finds broad applications across various fields. However,
numerous studies treat temporal events as single time points, neglecting their
durations. Time-interval-related pattern (TIRP) mining is introduced to address
this issue and has been applied to healthcare analytics, stock prediction, etc.
Typically, mining all patterns is not only computationally challenging for
accurate forecasting but also resource-intensive in terms of time and memory.
Targeting the extraction of time-interval-related patterns based on specific
criteria can improve data analysis efficiency and better align with customer
preferences. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called TaTIRP to
discover Targeted Time-Interval Related Patterns. Additionally, we develop
multiple pruning strategies to eliminate redundant extension operations,
thereby enhancing performance on large-scale datasets. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: 现代数据中心系统在常见情况下可实现强同步特性，Chora协议在吞吐量上表现更优。

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as state machine replication, are critical
infrastructures for modern applications. Practical distributed protocols make
minimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a
partially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we
argue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong
synchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous
lock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design
that uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,
and loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging
our engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication
protocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

Conclusion: 探针机凭借并行架构和分子实现超越经典模型局限，有望解决复杂现实问题。

Abstract: Efficiently solving NP-complete problems-such as protein structure
prediction, cryptographic decryption, and vulnerability detection-remains a
central challenge in computer science. Traditional electronic computers,
constrained by the Turing machine's one-dimensional data processing and
sequential operations, struggle to address these issues effectively. To
overcome this bottleneck, computational models must adopt multidimensional data
structures and parallel information processing mechanisms. Building on our
team's proposed probe machine model (a non-Turing computational framework),
this study develops a blocking probe technique that leverages DNA computing's
inherent parallelism to identify all valid solutions for NP-complete problems
in a single probe operation. Using the 27-vertex 3-coloring problem as a case
study, we successfully retrieved all solutions through DNA molecular probe
experiments. This breakthrough demonstrates the first implementation of a fully
parallel computing system at the molecular level, offering a novel paradigm for
tackling computational complexity. Our results indicate that the probe machine,
with its parallel architecture and molecular implementation, transcends the
limitations of classical models and holds promise for solving intricate
real-world problems.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the classic Max-Cut problem under multiple cardinality constraints,
which we refer to as the Constrained Max-Cut problem. Given a graph $G=(V, E)$,
a partition of the vertices into $c$ disjoint parts $V_1, \ldots, V_c$, and
cardinality parameters $k_1, \ldots, k_c$, the goal is to select a set $S
\subseteq V$ such that $|S \cap V_i| = k_i$ for each $i \in [c]$, maximizing
the total weight of edges crossing $S$ (i.e., edges with exactly one endpoint
in $S$).
  By designing an approximate kernel for Constrained Max-Cut and building on
the correlation rounding technique of Raghavendra and Tan (2012), we present a
$(0.858 - \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem when $c =
O(1)$. The algorithm runs in time $O\left(\min\{k/\varepsilon,
n\}^{\poly(c/\varepsilon)} + \poly(n)\right)$, where $k = \sum_{i \in [c]} k_i$
and $n=|V|$. This improves upon the $(\frac{1}{2} +
\varepsilon_0)$-approximation of Feige and Langberg (2001) for $\maxcut_k$ (the
special case when $c=1, k_1 = k$), and generalizes the $(0.858 -
\varepsilon)$-approximation of Raghavendra and Tan (2012), which only applies
when $\min\{k,n-k\}=\Omega(n)$ and does not handle multiple constraints.
  We also establish that, for general values of $c$, it is NP-hard to determine
whether a feasible solution exists that cuts all edges. Finally, we present a
$1/2$-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut under an arbitrary matroid
constraint.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Suppose that a group test operation is available for checking order relations
in a set, can this speed up problems like finding the minimum/maximum element,
rank determination and selection? We consider a one-sided group test to be
available, where queries are of the form $u \le_Q V$ or $V \le_Q u$, and the
answer is `yes' if and only if there is some $v \in V$ such that $u \le v$ or
$v \le u$, respectively. We restrict attention to total orders and focus on
query-complexity; for min or max finding, we give a Las Vegas algorithm that
makes $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 n)$ expected queries. We also give randomized
approximate algorithms for rank determination and selection; we allow a
relative error of $1 \pm \delta$ for $\delta > 0$ in the estimated rank or
selected element. In this case, we give a Monte Carlo algorithm for approximate
rank determination with expected query complexity
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\delta^2 - \log \epsilon)$, where $1-\epsilon$ is the
probability that the algorithm succeeds. We also give a Monte Carlo algorithm
for approximate selection that has expected query complexity
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(-\log( \epsilon \delta^2) / \delta^4)$; it has probability
at least $\frac{1}{2}$ to output an element $x$, and if so, $x$ has the desired
approximate rank with probability $1-\epsilon$.

Abstract: We study the multiprocessor scheduling with rejection problem under a machine
cost constraint. In this problem, each job is either rejected with a rejection
penalty or; accepted and scheduled on one of the machines for processing. The
machine cost is proportional to the total processing time of the jobs scheduled
on it. The problem aims to minimize the makespan of accepted jobs plus the
total rejection penalty of rejected jobs while the total machine cost does not
exceed a given upper bound. We present a simple $2$-approximation algorithm for
the problem and we achieve an EPTAS when the number $m$ of machines is a fixed
constant.

Conclusion: 将方法应用于减少 DNA 逻辑和信号传播中的泄漏，为熵力区分配置时的平衡浓度设计和验证提供新框架。

Abstract: Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally
analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we
focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers)
combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy
parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all
interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded
(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different
ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the
saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.
Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer
concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers
are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even
if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper
bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial
arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to
real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to
decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new
framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when
configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.

Abstract: Weighted equitable partitioning of a graph has been of interest lately due to
several applications, including redistricting, network algorithms, and image
decomposition. Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has
been of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors
partitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by
Charikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,
producing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced
partition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance
probability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs
and grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces
with probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling
algorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that
spanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability
of being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions
can be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast
almost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another
provably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.
  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for
equitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in
special cases that were believed to be more promising. We present a family of
graphs where the Markov chain fails to be irreducible when it must keep the
components perfectly equitable; yet when the chain is allowed an imbalance of
just one vertex between components, the rejection sampling step may take
exponential time. This is true even when the graph satisfies desirable
properties that have been conjectured to be sufficient for fast sampling.

Conclusion: 算法在强指数时间假设下，运行时间在对数因子内最优，获得优于\(O(\log n)\)近似是NP难问题。

Abstract: Graph-based nearest neighbor search methods have seen a surge of popularity
in recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of
applications. Central to these methods is the task of constructing a sparse
navigable search graph for a given dataset endowed with a distance function.
Unfortunately, doing so is computationally expensive, so heuristics are
universally used in practice.
  In this work, we initiate the study of fast algorithms with provable
guarantees for search graph construction. For a dataset with $n$ data points,
the problem of constructing an optimally sparse navigable graph can be framed
as $n$ separate but highly correlated minimum set cover instances. This yields
a naive $O(n^3)$ time greedy algorithm that returns a navigable graph whose
sparsity is at most $O(\log n)$ higher than optimal. We improve significantly
on this baseline, taking advantage of correlation between the set cover
instances to leverage techniques from streaming and sublinear-time set cover
algorithms. Combined with problem-specific pre-processing techniques, we
present an $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ time algorithm for constructing an $O(\log
n)$-approximate sparsest navigable graph under any distance function.
  The runtime of our method is optimal up to logarithmic factors under the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis via a reduction from Monochromatic Closest
Pair. Moreover, we prove that, as with general set cover, obtaining better than
an $O(\log n)$-approximation is NP-hard, despite the significant additional
structure present in the navigable graph problem. Finally, we show that our
techniques can also beat cubic time for the closely related and practically
important problems of constructing $\alpha$-shortcut reachable and
$\tau$-monotonic graphs, which are also used for nearest neighbor search. For
such graphs, we obtain $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$ time or better algorithms.

Method: 开发带在线预测的等待策略，每个预测是对整个路线中每个调度的二元决策，而非提前预测整个请求集。

Result: 提出的在线调度算法能在多项式时间内实现一定的一致性和鲁棒性，最佳一致性在特定条件下趋近于2。

Conclusion: 任何基于在线调度的算法即使有完美在线预测，竞争比也不能小于2。

Abstract: We revisit the well-known online traveling salesman problem (OLTSP) and its
extension, the online dial-a-ride problem (OLDARP). A server starting at a
designated origin in a metric space, is required to serve online requests, and
return to the origin such that the completion time is minimized. The SmartStart
algorithm, introduced by Ascheuer et al., incorporates a waiting approach into
an online schedule-based algorithm and attains the optimal upper bound of 2 for
the OLTSP and the OLDARP if each schedule is optimal. Using the Christofides'
heuristic to approximate each schedule leads to the currently best upper bound
of (7 + sqrt(13)) / 4 approximately 2.6514 in polynomial time.
  In this study, we investigate how an online algorithm with predictions, a
recent popular framework (i.e. the so-called learning-augmented algorithms),
can be used to improve the best competitive ratio in polynomial time. In
particular, we develop a waiting strategy with online predictions, each of
which is only a binary decision-making for every schedule in a whole route,
rather than forecasting an entire set of requests in the beginning (i.e.
offline predictions). That is, it does not require knowing the number of
requests in advance. The proposed online schedule-based algorithm can achieve
1.1514 * lambda + 1.5-consistency and 1.5 + 1.5 / (2.3028 * lambda -
1)-robustness in polynomial time, where lambda lies in the interval (1/theta,
1] and theta is set to (1 + sqrt(13)) / 2 approximately 2.3028. The best
consistency tends to approach to 2 when lambda is close to 1/theta. Meanwhile,
we show any online schedule-based algorithms cannot derive a competitive ratio
of less than 2 even with perfect online predictions.

Conclusion: 成功设计出无向图二分性比率的近似算法及相关应用算法。

Abstract: We propose an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the bipartiteness ratio
for undirected graphs introduced by Trevisan (SIAM Journal on Computing, vol.
41, no. 6, 2012), where $n$ is the number of vertices. Our approach extends the
cut-matching game framework for sparsest cut to the bipartiteness ratio. Our
algorithm requires only $\mathrm{poly}\log n$ many single-commodity undirected
maximum flow computations. Therefore, with the current fastest undirected
max-flow algorithms, it runs in nearly linear time. Along the way, we introduce
the concept of well-linkedness for skew-symmetric graphs and prove a novel
characterization of bipartitness ratio in terms of well-linkedness in an
auxiliary skew-symmetric graph, which may be of independent interest.
  As an application, we devise an $\tilde{O}(mn)$-time algorithm that given a
graph whose maximum cut deletes a $1-\eta$ fraction of edges, finds a cut that
deletes a $1 - O(\log n \log(1/\eta)) \cdot \eta$ fraction of edges, where $m$
is the number of edges.

Conclusion: 该算法适用于实际应用，证明思路可改进现有算法近似比，拓展到更广泛约束问题。

Abstract: A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by
taking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike
standard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for
the solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the
subset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that
the greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular
maximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether
a firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack
constraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question
affirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses
an appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the
greedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically
tight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many
value oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We
further show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone
problem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it
well-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from
(Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\tilde O(n^2k^2)$
time.
  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from
an optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to
evaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous
analysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved
approximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method
naturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader
constraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework.

Result: 在真实和合成的大规模图上进行大量实验，EP - BFS速度可达10倍提升。

Conclusion: EP - BFS算法在半外部内存模型下处理BFS问题高效，能显著提升速度。

Abstract: Breadth-first search (BFS) is known as a basic search strategy for learning
graph properties. As the scales of graph databases have increased tremendously
in recent years, large-scale graphs G are often disk-resident. Obtaining the
BFS results of G in semi-external memory model is inevitable, because the
in-memory BFS algorithm has to maintain the entire G in the main memory, and
external BFS algorithms consume high computational costs. As a good trade-off
between the internal and external memory models, semi-external memory model
assumes that the main memory can at least reside a spanning tree of G.
Nevertheless, the semi-external BFS problem is still an open issue due to its
difficulty. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive study for processing
BFS in semi-external memory model. After discussing the naive solutions based
on the basic framework of semi-external graph algorithms, this paper presents
an efficient algorithm, named EP-BFS, with a small minimum memory space
requirement, which is an important factor for evaluating semi-external
algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic
large-scale graphs, where graph WDC-2014 contains over 1.7 billion nodes, and
graph eu-2015 has over 91 billion edges. Experimental results confirm that
EP-BFS can achieve up to 10 times faster.

Conclusion: 成功引入PoD概念并量化了TSP中解的多样性与成本的权衡，得到特定情形下的PoD值。

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of the "Price of Diversity" (PoD) in
discrete optimization problems, quantifying the trade-off between solution
diversity and cost. For a minimization problem, the PoD is defined as the
worst-case ratio, over all instances, of the minimum achievable cost of a
diverse set of $k$ solutions to the cost of a single optimal solution for the
same instance. Here, the cost of a $k$-solution set is determined by the most
expensive solution within the set. Focusing on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) as a key example, we study the PoD in the setting where $k$ edge-disjoint
tours are required. We establish that, asymptotically, the PoD of finding two
edge-disjoint tours is $\frac{8}{5}$ in a special one-dimensional case and 2 in
a general metric space. We obtain these results from analyzing a related
fundamental problem: the Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem (SHP), for which we
establish similar results.

Abstract: Expanders are powerful algorithmic structures with two key properties: they
are
  a) routable: for any multi-commodity flow unit demand, there exists a routing
with low congestion over short paths, where a demand is unit if the amount of
demand sent / received by any vertex is at most the number of edges adjacent to
it.
  b) stable / prunable: for any (sequence of) edge failures, there exists a
proportionally small subset of vertices that can be disabled, such that the
graph induced on the remaining vertices is an expander.
  Two natural algorithmic problems correspond to these two existential
guarantees: expander routing, i.e. computing a low-congestion routing for a
unit multi-commodity demand on an expander, and expander pruning, i.e.,
maintaining the subset of disabled vertices under a sequence of edge failures.
  This paper considers the combination of the two problems: maintaining a
routing for a unit multi-commodity demand under pruning steps. This is done
through the introduction of a family of expander graphs that, like hypercubes,
are easy to route in, and are self-pruning: for an online sequence of edge
deletions, a simple self-contained algorithm can find a few vertices to prune
with each edge deletion, such that the remaining graph always remains an
easy-to-route-in expander in the family.
  Notably, and with considerable technical work, this self-pruning can be made
worst-case, i.e., such that every single adversarial deletion only causes a
small number of additional deletions. Our results also allow tight
constant-factor control over the length of routing paths (with the usual
trade-offs in congestion and pruning ratio) and therefore extend to
constant-hop and length-constrained expanders in which routing over constant
length paths is crucial.

Motivation: 在已有H - 着色问题针对顶点覆盖数参数化核结果基础上，进一步研究其核大小的上下界。

Method: 提出两种核化算法，一是纯组合算法，基于图H的非邻接见证数；二是利用线性代数工具和图的忠实独立表示概念。

Result: 得到自然图类H有固定多项式大小的核，组合核多项式次数对几乎所有图H在Δ(H)上对数增长；线性代数核加强已有结果，对有限域正交图表示维度问题得到近最优核。

Conclusion: 给出上下界，近乎解决各种目标图H下该问题的核复杂度。

Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem asks whether a given graph
admits an edge-preserving function from its vertex set to that of $H$. A
seminal theorem of Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il asserts that the $H$-Coloring
problem is NP-hard whenever $H$ is loopless and non-bipartite. A result of
Jansen and Pieterse implies that for every graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem
parameterized by the vertex cover number $k$ admits a kernel with
$O(k^{\Delta(H)})$ vertices and bit-size bounded by $O(k^{\Delta(H)} \cdot \log
k)$, where $\Delta(H)$ denotes the maximum degree in $H$. For the case where
$H$ is a complete graph on at least three vertices, this kernel size nearly
matches conditional lower bounds established by Jansen and Kratsch and by
Jansen and Pieterse.
  This paper presents new upper and lower bounds on the kernel size of
$H$-Coloring problems parameterized by the vertex cover number. The upper
bounds arise from two kernelization algorithms. The first is purely
combinatorial, and its size is governed by a structural quantity of the graph
$H$, called the non-adjacency witness number. As applications, we obtain
kernels whose size is bounded by a fixed polynomial for natural classes of
graphs $H$ with unbounded maximum degree. More strikingly, we show that for
almost every graph $H$, the degree of the polynomial that bounds the size of
our combinatorial kernel grows only logarithmically in $\Delta(H)$. Our second
kernel leverages linear-algebraic tools and involves the notion of faithful
independent representations of graphs. It strengthens the general bound from
prior work and, among other applications, yields near-optimal kernels for
problems concerning the dimension of orthogonal graph representations over
finite fields. We complement these results with conditional lower bounds,
thereby nearly settling the kernel complexity of the problem for various target
graphs $H$.

Motivation: 现有子集到达模型下仅知简单O(log n)竞争的舍入方案，需更好的舍入方案来改进算法。

Method: 提出在子集到达模型下有s已知假设的O(log² s)竞争舍入方案，针对s = 2的集合覆盖（边覆盖）提出边到达模型下1.8竞争的舍入方案。

Conclusion: 新的舍入方案在s较小时相比现有算法有改进。

Abstract: A rounding scheme for set cover has served as an important component in
design of approximation algorithms for the problem, and there exists an
H_s-approximate rounding scheme, where s denotes the maximum subset size,
directly implying an approximation algorithm with the same approximation
guarantee. A rounding scheme has also been considered under some online models,
and in particular, under the element arrival model used as a crucial subroutine
in algorithms for online set cover, an O(log s)-competitive rounding scheme is
known [Buchbinder, Chen, and Naor, SODA 2014]. On the other hand, under a more
general model, called the subset arrival model, only a simple O(log
n)-competitive rounding scheme is known, where n denotes the number of elements
in the ground set.
  In this paper, we present an O(log^2 s)-competitive rounding scheme under the
subset arrival model, with one mild assumption that s is known upfront. Using
our rounding scheme, we immediately obtain an O(log^2 s)-approximation
algorithm for multi-stage stochastic set cover, improving upon the existing
algorithms [Swamy and Shmoys, SICOMP 2012; Byrka and Srinivasan, SIDMA 2018]
when s is small enough compared to the number of stages and the number of
elements. Lastly, for set cover with s = 2, also known as edge cover, we
present a 1.8-competitive rounding scheme under the edge arrival model.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study repeated \textsf{Uniform Pricing} mechanisms with multiple buyers.
In each round, the platform sets a uniform price for all buyers; a transaction
occurs if at least one buyer bids at or above this price. Prior work
demonstrates that structural assumptions on bid distributions -- such as
regularity or monotone hazard rate (MHR) property -- enable significant
improvements in pricing query complexity (from
$\Theta\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ to
$\widetilde\Theta\left(\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$\footnote{The $\widetilde
\Theta$ notation omits polylogarithmic factors.}) and regret bounds (from
$\Theta\left(T^{2/3}\right)$ to $\widetilde\Theta\left(T^{1/2}\right)$) for
single-buyer settings. Strikingly, we demonstrate that these improvements
vanish with multiple buyers: both general and structured distributions
(including regular/MHR) share identical asymptotic performance, achieving
pricing query complexity of $\widetilde\Theta\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ and
regret of $\widetilde\Theta\left(T^{2/3}\right)$.
  This result reveals a dichotomy between single-agent and multi-agent
environments. While the special structure of distributions simplifies learning
for a single buyer, competition among multiple buyers erases these benefits,
forcing platforms to adopt universally robust pricing strategies. Our findings
challenge conventional wisdom from single-buyer theory and underscore the
necessity of revisiting mechanism design principles in more competitive
settings.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected
vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and
traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced
opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs)
often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing
35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and

Motivation: 自主多模态语言模型成为网络代理对展示广告构成威胁，且不清楚其与广告的交互方式和可靠参与的设计原则。

Method: 使用新闻网站TT.com的克隆版，设置多种广告，用DOM - 中心的浏览器使用框架和多种模型，执行10个现实用户任务进行300次初始试验及后续试验。

Result: 代理有严重的满足性，不超过两个视口滚动，忽略纯视觉行动呼吁；部分模型在抽奖需购买时100%或70%订阅；识别出五个设计原则。

Conclusion: 提出的设计原则可使以人为中心的创意对机器可检测且不损害用户体验，强调需在现实广告中建立强大的信任评估框架。

Abstract: Autonomous multimodal language models are rapidly evolving into web agents
that can browse, click, and purchase items on behalf of users, posing a threat
to display advertising designed for human eyes. Yet little is known about how
these agents interact with ads or which design principles ensure reliable
engagement. To address this, we ran a controlled experiment using a faithful
clone of the news site TT.com, seeded with diverse ads: static banners, GIFs,
carousels, videos, cookie dialogues, and paywalls. We ran 300 initial trials
plus follow-ups using the Document Object Model (DOM)-centric Browser Use
framework with GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the pixel-based
OpenAI Operator, across 10 realistic user tasks. Our results show these agents
display severe satisficing: they never scroll beyond two viewports and ignore
purely visual calls to action, clicking banners only when semantic button
overlays or off-screen text labels are present. Critically, when sweepstake
participation required a purchase, GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet subscribed in
100% of trials, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in 70%, revealing gaps in cost-benefit
analysis. We identified five actionable design principles-semantic overlays,
hidden labels, top-left placement, static frames, and dialogue replacement,
that make human-centric creatives machine-detectable without harming user
experience. We also evaluated agent trustworthiness through "behavior patterns"
such as cookie consent handling and subscription choices, highlighting
model-specific risk boundaries and the urgent need for robust trust evaluation
frameworks in real-world advertising.

Method: 提出GMC方法，用物品分词器生成域共享语义标识符，将物品推荐建模为下一个标记生成任务，引入域感知对比损失并进行特定域微调。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，GMC比一系列基线方法更有效。

Conclusion: GMC方法在多目标跨域推荐任务中具有有效性。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) are essential for online platforms, providing
personalized suggestions to users within a vast sea of information.
Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative
filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite
graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both
supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss. However,
this separate design introduces additional graph convolution processes and
creates inconsistencies in gradient directions due to disparate losses,
resulting in prolonged training times and sub-optimal performance. In this
study, we introduce a unified framework of Supervised Graph Contrastive
Learning for recommendation (SGCL) to address these issues. SGCL uniquely
combines the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses
into a cohesive supervised contrastive learning loss, aligning both tasks
within a single optimization direction for exceptionally fast training.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SGCL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate
continued research, we release our model publicly.

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented

Conclusion: RONOM框架有效结合降阶建模和算子学习，在解决偏微分方程问题上有更好的性能和应用前景。

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Method: 提出自动化多知识学习压缩框架；设计GPU加速的(s,k)-mer编码器；引入数据块分区和逐步模型传递机制；设计两种压缩模式PMKLC - S和PMKLC - M。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上，PMKLC - S/M平均压缩比分别提高73.609%和73.480%，平均吞吐量分别提高3.036倍和10.710倍。

Conclusion: PMKLC - S/M具有最佳鲁棒性和有竞争力的内存成本，能在不同概率分布扰动数据集上稳定运行，可在内存受限设备上运行。

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水平联邦学习中数据异质性导致的客户端性能差异大、模型公平性问题。

Method: 先使用基尼系数衡量客户端性能差异，建立其与全局模型更新规模的关系，再根据系统实时公平状态动态调整聚合权重。

Result: 在Office - Caltech - 10、CIFAR - 10和Synthetic数据集上实验，FedGA有效改善方差和基尼系数等公平性指标，且整体性能良好。

Conclusion: FedGA方法有效提升联邦学习中的公平性。

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Result: 基础设施和算法优化使吞吐量提高600%，PinFM使新物品参与度提高20%。

Conclusion: PinFM可有效处理用户活动序列，已部署改善超五亿用户体验。

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Abstract: This study explores novel activation functions that enhance the ability of

limitations of traditional activation functions like $\mathrm{ReLU}$, we
propose $\mathrm{SmoothSplit}$ and $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$, which introduce
topology "cutting" capabilities. These functions enable networks to transform
complex data manifolds effectively, improving performance in scenarios with
low-dimensional layers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$ outperforms
traditional activations in low-dimensional settings while maintaining
competitive performance in higher-dimensional ones. Our findings highlight the
potential of topology-aware activation functions in advancing neural network
architectures. The code is available via

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Motivation: 解决排序向量聚类问题，与经典k - means聚类不同，KRC要求观测和质心均为排序向量，有实际应用价值。

Method: 证明KRC的NP难并刻画可行集；给出单簇最优质心解析解；开发KRCA迭代优化KMC初始解；引入BnB算法进行高效簇重建，利用决策树框架并控制参数平衡质量和效率；建立理论误差界。

Result: 通过合成和真实数据集实验，KRCA始终优于基线解，提高解质量且计算速度快。

Conclusion: KRC对个性化和大规模决策有实际意义，为未来研究提供方法改进和见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

Motivation: 探究[0,1]值回归中是否存在能达到方差依赖界（二阶界）的损失函数，以改进一阶界。

Method: 先证明对数损失最小化器有类似一阶界，再提出投注损失函数。

Result: 提出投注损失函数，实现了不依赖先验方差知识的“方差自适应”界。

Conclusion: 存在能达到方差依赖界的损失函数，投注损失函数可实现该结果。

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

Result: 所提编码器能有效学习与特征标记对齐的表示，但在超参数优化热启动元任务中不一定能带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提表格表示学习方法在与特征标记对齐方面有效，但在特定元任务性能提升上存在局限。

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型微调时选择最优任务数据集混合比例多为手动、启发式过程，需要更好的方法。

Result: 在Llama 2和Mistral上，在MMLU和BIGBench等评估套件中取得一致的经验改进。

Conclusion: TASKPGM是高效且稳健的大语言模型微调的有力工具，能提供可解释见解。

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Result: 确定的方向能系统地引发蒸馏推理模型的回溯行为，且不能用标记级属性简单解释；该方向在基础模型中不引发回溯。

Conclusion: 推理微调模型复用基础模型的现有表示，而非从头学习新能力。

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

Conclusion: 实时自适应应用存在关键的性能 - 隐私权衡，需要为自适应单用户应用专门设计FL方法。

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

Result: 在实验中外推域相对L2误差平均降低40%，平均绝对误差平均降低50%，且计算成本无显著增加。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升PINNs的外推能力、鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出新的分布差异度量方法NAMMD用于分布接近性测试（DCT），理论和实验证明其在DCT和两样本测试中比基于MMD的方法有更高检验功效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DCT方法主要用于离散一维空间分布对，难以应用于复杂数据，而引入的MMD在评估多分布对接近性时信息不足。

Method: 设计新的分布差异度量方法NAMMD，通过分布的再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）范数缩放MMD值，基于NAMMD的渐近分布提出NAMMD - based DCT。

Result: 理论证明NAMMD - based DCT有更高检验功效且第一类错误有界，实验在多种数据上验证了该结论；在两样本测试问题中，NAMMD - based两样本测试也有更高检验功效。

Conclusion: NAMMD在分布接近性测试和两样本测试问题中比MMD表现更好。

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Conclusion: LySep模型能有效改善基于深度学习的偏微分方程求解方法的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and
temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with
clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation

Motivation: 随着中国多层次资本市场发展，新三板成为中小企业重要融资平台，但许多新三板上市公司面临较高财务困境风险，需进行财务风险预测。

Method: 提出多通道深度学习框架，设计三通道图同构网络分别处理数值、文本和图输入，用基于注意力机制和门控单元融合模态表示。

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods
and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for
SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and
investors.

Motivation: 时间序列预测有非平稳性等复杂特征，Transformer架构处理长序列效率低，现有State - Space Models不能有效捕捉多尺度周期性和瞬态动态，且易受数据噪声影响。

Method: 提出FLDmamba框架，利用傅里叶和拉普拉斯变换优势，捕捉多尺度周期性和瞬态动态，提高模型对数据噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: FLDmamba在时间序列预测基准测试中表现优于Transformer和其他Mamba架构。

Conclusion: FLDmamba能有效解决现有方法在时间序列预测中的局限，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

Motivation: 离线强化学习实际应用受显式奖励标注需求阻碍，奖励标注成本高或难追溯获取。

Method: 提出ReLOAD框架，将随机网络蒸馏（RND）适配，基于专家状态转移训练预测网络模仿固定目标网络嵌入，用网络间预测误差作为奖励信号。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，ReLOAD实现了稳健的离线策略学习，性能与传统奖励标注方法有竞争力。

Conclusion: ReLOAD框架可在无手工奖励标注情况下提供结构化奖励信号，有效进行离线策略学习。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

Result: 较大学习率使最终NTK的主特征向量及完整NTK矩阵与训练目标有更大对齐。

Conclusion: 增强了对深度学习中GD训练动态的理解。

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

Motivation: 现有基于无线信号的人员识别大多依赖运动模式，静止状态下的人员识别研究不足，需开发不依赖用户运动的识别方法。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的方法，利用CSI进行人员识别；引入ESP32设备在室内环境采集的数据集；采用包括去除异常值、平滑和相位校准的预处理流程；使用双分支Transformer架构分别处理幅度和相位模态。

Conclusion: 证明了CSI扰动的鉴别潜力，证实了在现实场景中使用低成本商用Wi-Fi硬件进行被动、无设备人员识别的可行性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 提出的SFT变体在相关任务中表现良好，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG

Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low
usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we
propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a

ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Result: ULER在八个分类和回归基准测试及新的人工标注数据集上优于现有技术和解释感知学习拒绝策略。

Conclusion: ULER可有效解决学习拒绝低质量解释问题，新数据集将公开促进后续研究。

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

<details>

Motivation: Transformer 基预测模型计算效率难以满足大规模云环境要求，多数工作负载序列有复杂周期模式，需在频域解决挑战。

Method: 提出 Fremer 模型，收集并开源四个来自字节跳动云服务的高质量工作负载数据集。

Result: Fremer 效率、准确性和多周期序列性能表现出色，在实验中各项指标优于基线模型，在主动自动扩缩容测试中改善平均延迟、降低资源消耗。

Conclusion: Fremer 模型有效且高效，在工作负载预测和实际应用中有良好表现。

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 利用预测不确定性是提高模型解释性的有效补充方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

Result: TReconLM优于现有轨迹重建算法，包括之前的深度学习方法，能无错误地恢复更高比例的序列。

Conclusion: TReconLM在轨迹重建方面有良好表现，可用于解决DNA数据存储中的错误纠正问题。

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

Motivation: 标准策略梯度方法存在不稳定性和样本低效问题，尤其是在稀疏奖励场景下。

Result: 理论分析表明两种方法的目标函数在强化学习理论框架内可收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: 提出的混合策略框架能有效平衡探索与利用，实现更稳定高效的策略优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型推理链错误检测方法不佳，提出ARES框架解决错误传播问题，在多基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的错误检测方法无法妥善处理推理链中早期错误对下游推理判断的影响，难以检测传播性错误。

Method: 引入Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES)概率框架，基于先前评估的合理前提判断每个论断，为每一步给出细致分数并提供统计保证。

Result: ARES在四个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能（Macro - F1为72.1%，提升8.2分），在长合成推理链上有出色的鲁棒性，检测传播性错误的F1值达90.3%，提升27.6分。

Conclusion: ARES框架能有效解决大语言模型推理链中的错误传播问题，提高错误检测能力。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Conclusion: 该方法为图分类等任务提供了有效途径，指出了未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法在准确、局部和全自动的行车基础设施健康监测方面有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效利用分布式数据和低能力设备，在不共享原始数据情况下提升GAN训练性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Conclusion: 所提模型在知识图谱表示学习方面具有有效性和竞争力。

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

Conclusion: 该方案是有前景的第一步，但需真实数据测试以达到实际应用的成熟度。

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

Result: 应用于AnthroProtect数据集，CFR对灌木地、森林和湿地赋予更高相关性；不确定性增加时，相关性热力图可解释性下降、熵增加。

Conclusion: CFR提供了基于确定性评估卫星图像中模式与自然度相关性的数据中心方法。

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Conclusion: 研究结果为LTSF中Transformer架构设计的未来研究提供有价值指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Conclusion: DASViT能有效解决现有方法在探索ViT架构时的局限，具有良好效果。

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model

AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.
The source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Motivation: 现有图生成方法可解释性有限，难以明确结构决策背后的原理。

Method: 提出受自然语言处理中主题建模启发的神经图主题模型（NGTM），将图表示为潜在主题的混合。

Result: NGTM达到有竞争力的生成质量，能实现细粒度控制和可解释性。

Conclusion: NGTM可通过主题层面的调整来调整结构特征或引入生物特性。

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

Conclusion: 发布NVTTS数据集及标注指南，解决表达性TTS研究关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional
categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive
TTS research. The dataset is available at

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a
fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured
and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and
outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and
IRL techniques.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 单调梯度函数在最优传输问题中起核心作用，此前提出mGradNets，希望利用其直接学习最优传输映射

Method: 通过最小化基于Monge - Ampère方程定义的训练损失函数，利用mGradNets直接学习最优传输映射

Result: mGradNets的结构偏差有助于学习最优传输映射

Conclusion: 方法可应用于机器人集群控制问题

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

Result: 在多种插补场景（如块状和逐点缺失、可变采样率）中展示了强大的域内和域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为适应性基础插补模型的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

Motivation: 当前最先进的排列空间贝叶斯优化方法依赖的 Mallows 核复杂度高。

Method: 提出基于排序算法生成核函数框架，引入 Merge Kernel 并结合三个轻量级、与任务无关的描述符。

Result: 所提出的核在各种排列优化基准测试中始终优于最先进的 Mallows 核。

Conclusion: Merge Kernel 为排列空间的贝叶斯优化提供了更紧凑、更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于以人为中心的AI应用，如高风险协作环境中的智能决策支持系统。

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

Result: 在三个不同发展阶段国家的实验中，模型在估算社会经济指标方面优于基线，即使在数据有限的低收入国家也是如此。

Conclusion: GeoReg模型能有效解决数据稀缺地区社会经济指标的估算问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

Motivation: 神经网络对输入和权重扰动敏感，易出现对抗样本、训练发散和过拟合问题，过去基于Lipschitz组件构建神经网络的技术未成熟，需要填补相关研究空白。

Method: 开发并测试维护范数约束权重矩阵的工具，应用其训练transformer模型；研究优化器动态，从AdamW切换到Muon；共同设计权重约束方法。

Result: 切换到Muon可改进标准方法，使模型以更低Lipschitz界达到相同性能；设计的权重约束方法改善MLP和2M参数transformer的Lipschitz与性能权衡；不同参数规模和Lipschitz界的transformer在不同数据集上有不同准确率表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能训练带Lipschitz约束的transformer模型，且训练时无需层归一化等稳定措施，但要达到基线准确率，Lipschitz上界需大幅提高。

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Abstract: Image classification currently faces significant security challenges due to
adversarial attacks, which consist of intentional alterations designed to
deceive classification models based on artificial intelligence. This article
explores an approach to generate adversarial attacks against image classifiers
using a combination of evolutionary algorithms and generative adversarial
networks. The proposed approach explores the latent space of a generative
adversarial network with an evolutionary algorithm to find vectors representing
adversarial attacks. The approach was evaluated in two case studies
corresponding to the classification of handwritten digits and object images.
The results showed success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits, and up to
75% for object images, improving over other search methods and reported results
in related works. The applied method proved to be effective in handling data
diversity on the target datasets, even in problem instances that presented
additional challenges due to the complexity and richness of information.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful generative models but
remain challenging to train due to pathologies suchas mode collapse and
instability. Recent research has explored co-evolutionary approaches, in which
populations of generators and discriminators are evolved, as a promising
solution. This paper presents an empirical analysis of different coevolutionary
GAN training strategies, focusing on the impact of selection and replacement
mechanisms. We compare (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda)
with tournament selection coevolutionary schemes, along with a non-evolutionary
population based multi-generator multi-discriminator GAN baseline, across both
synthetic low-dimensional datasets (blob and gaussian mixtures) and an
image-based benchmark (MNIST). Results show that full generational replacement,
i.e., (mu,lambda), consistently outperforms in terms of both sample quality and
diversity, particularly when combined with larger offspring sizes. In contrast,
elitist approaches tend to converge prematurely and suffer from reduced
diversity. These findings highlight the importance of balancing exploration and
exploitation dynamics in coevolutionary GAN training and provide guidance for
designing more effective population-based generative models.

RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced
LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the

Motivation: 不同量子SDK带来互操作性和跨平台开发挑战，传统规则式转译器设计维护耗时。

Method: 利用大语言模型的预训练知识和上下文推理能力，将其作为语言无关的转译器。

Result: 实现量子程序在不同QSDK间转换，保持功能等价。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动定义转换规则，为量子软件可移植性提供可扩展解决方案，推动量子计算生态通用转译发展。

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

TL;DR: 介绍Kodezi Chronos架构用于代码理解、调试和维护，在长上下文处理和性能上优于现有模型，推动软件生态发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在代码生成和自动化中受推理时上下文限制及缺乏显式代码结构推理能力的约束，需新架构解决。

Method: 引入Kodezi Chronos架构，利用多级嵌入内存引擎，结合向量和基于图的索引及代码感知检索；提出多随机检索基准进行评估。

Result: Chronos在真实世界的错误检测中比先前模型提升23%，相比传统方法减少调试周期达40%。

Conclusion: Chronos实现无缝自主软件维护，提高代码可靠性和生产力，是迈向自我维持、持续优化软件生态的关键进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

Method: 回顾22个顶级软件工程场所发表的115项同行评审研究，分析出版趋势、分类主题和算法、考察关键因素。

Result: 完成软件工程中强化学习应用的首次系统映射，成果公开。

Conclusion: 为研究者和从业者提供支持，有助于该领域发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential
decision-making and has attracted growing interest across various domains,
particularly following the advent of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in 2015.
Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
further fueled interest in integrating RL with LLMs to enable more adaptive and
intelligent systems. In the field of software engineering (SE), the increasing
complexity of systems and the rising demand for automation have motivated
researchers to apply RL to a broad range of tasks, from software design and
development to quality assurance and maintenance. Despite growing research in
RL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of
this evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies
published across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We
conducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics
and RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design
and optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open
challenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing
work in this evolving area. To summarize, this survey offers the first
systematic mapping of RL applications in software engineering, aiming to
support both researchers and practitioners in navigating the current landscape
and advancing the field. Our artifacts are publicly available:

TL;DR: 提出RAGSum方法解决代码注释生成中检索与生成孤立优化问题，在多语言基准测试中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强方法中检索和生成通常孤立优化，会传播噪声，需要一种有效且高效的代码注释生成方法。

Method: 基于CodeT5构建RAGSum，融合检索与生成；采用对比预训练塑造代码嵌入；端到端训练结合复合损失；使用轻量级自精炼循环优化输出。

Result: 在三种跨语言基准测试（Java、Python、C）上，该方法在BLEU、METEOR和ROUGE - L指标上大幅优于三个成熟基线。

Conclusion: 紧密耦合检索和生成可提高代码注释自动化上限，值得后续复制研究和开发者定性研究。

Abstract: Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can
lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension.
Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments
and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically
optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise
downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with
the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is
built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We
report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on
CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for
nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a
composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes
comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop
is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three
cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three
well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially
outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These
findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the
ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and
qualitative developer studies.

Motivation: 现有工具检测软件架构异味后很少给出修复建议，需探索合适方法推荐重构。

Method: 将任务构建为三类分类问题，在从11,149个开源Java项目中挖掘的超200万个重构实例上微调CodeBERT和CodeT5模型。

Result: CodeT5准确率达96.9%，F1值达95.2%，优于CodeBERT和传统基线。

Conclusion: 基于变压器的模型能有效弥合异味检测和可操作修复之间的差距，为未来重构推荐系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Architectural smells such as God Class, Cyclic Dependency, and Hub-like
Dependency degrade software quality and maintainability. Existing tools detect
such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of
pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable
refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class
classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring
instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9%
accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our
results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap
between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future
refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under
an open license to support reproducibility and further research.

Motivation: 量子电路需具备容错能力，但大语言模型常输出有缺陷的Qiskit代码，需要改进。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)两种强化学习方法，对32B模型进行微调，并使用丰富注释的合成数据集。

Result: 在Qiskit HumanEval基准测试中，ORPO的Pass@1达到56.29%，GRPO达到49%；在原始HumanEval中分别为65.90%和63.00%。GRPO在基础任务表现出色，ORPO在中级任务表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有明显提升，但在AI辅助量子编程的高级任务方面仍有进步空间。

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

Motivation: 智能电网数字化产生新信息数据模型，为避免潜在干扰，需在设计时评估，但现有评估方法存在不足，缺乏明确步骤和显隐结合方法。

Method: 运用设计科学研究设计三相评估方法，结合显式和隐式评估方法，并通过工业灵活性描述的信息与数据模型开发案例进行完善。

Result: 设计出适用于开发新信息和数据模型的评估方法。

Conclusion: 所设计的评估方法可填补现有评估方法在智能电网背景下对新信息和数据模型设计过程评估的空白。

Abstract: The ongoing digitalisation of the smart grid is resulting in an increase in
automated information exchanges across distributed energy systems. This process
has led to the development of new information and data models when the existing
ones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly
designed information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during
the design process before they are implemented in operation.
  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid
domain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit
evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that
utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms
of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and
implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models
offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart
grid context.
  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design
science research to address this gap. Our evaluation approach combines explicit
and implicit evaluation methods and is applicable when developing new
information and data models. We use the development of an information model and
data model focused on industrial flexibility descriptions to refine our
evaluation approach. Additionally, we provide lessons learned from our
experience.

prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纠正当前软件开发中对大语言模型的被动依赖，重新确立开发者的主动角色。

Result: 无明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 单对话方法（SCM）是对当前依赖大语言模型做法的必要纠正，可让开发者发挥主动作用。

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动测试用例存在测试异味问题，现有的检测工具需手动定义规则且缺乏可扩展性，因此研究小型语言模型自动检测测试异味的潜力。

Method: 在143个真实的Ubuntu测试用例上评估Gemma3、Llama3.2和Phi - 4对七种类型测试异味的检测能力。

Result: Phi - 4检测有测试异味句子的pass@2达到97%，Gemma3和Llama3.2约为91%，SLMs能自主解释问题和提出改进建议。

Conclusion: SLMs是高效工具，能保护数据隐私，可在现实场景中提高测试质量。

Abstract: Manual testing, in which testers follow natural language instructions to
validate system behavior, remains crucial for uncovering issues not easily
captured by automation. However, these test cases often suffer from test
smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that
reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they
typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study
investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically
detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143
real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4
achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with
test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond
detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even
without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven
identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule
definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of
SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality
in real-world scenarios.

Result: 评估显示iReDev在多方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的iReDev框架有效，还展望了智能需求开发三个关键发展方向，有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Requirements development is a critical phase as it is responsible for
providing a clear understanding of what stakeholders need. It involves
collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address
potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,
multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.
However, existing research provides limited support for requirements
development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the
human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,
named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents
to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform
various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses
on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world
stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an
artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger
the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new
requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to
support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align
with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and
results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We
further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the
development of intelligent requirements development.

Conclusion: 为研究人员和从业者应对新兴挑战提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in large pretrained models have led to their widespread
integration as core components in modern software systems. The trend is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software
systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models
exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability
boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These
properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements
engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral
predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a
rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a
conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of
pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising
research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide
for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in
requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.

Result: 使用初始程序集证明该方法能通过生成的属性文法准确重现程序行为。

Conclusion: 该方法可实现全面的规范恢复。

Abstract: Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and
up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of
input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering
syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring
attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our
technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers
to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in
specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program
executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we
systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This
enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of
our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately
reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成代码广泛应用带来代码来源监管、版权纠纷、质量等问题，且现有检测方法面对修改后的代码鲁棒性不足，急需有效解决方案。

Method: 提出CodeGPTSensor+，采用对抗训练提升对输入扰动的鲁棒性，集成对抗样本生成模块MIST系统生成高质量、有代表性的对抗样本。

Result: 在HMCorp数据集实验显示，CodeGPTSensor+在对抗测试集上显著提高检测准确率，在原测试集也保持高准确率，鲁棒性优于CodeGPTSensor。

Conclusion: CodeGPTSensor+通过对抗训练和集成MIST模块，有效提升了对大语言模型生成代码的检测鲁棒性，在检测任务中有更好表现。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their powerful
code-generation capabilities have been widely applied in tasks like code
completion and automated development, demonstrating the value of improving
coding efficiency. However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises
several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code
provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly
concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its
compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the
other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to
manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.
Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods
for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness
when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective
solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may
undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of
CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against
input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation
module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which
systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial
samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against
diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset
demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on
the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test
set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.

Motivation: 准确状态估计需考虑过程和测量模型不确定性，现有协方差矩阵选择易出错，识别噪声特征是难题，现有方法有局限。

Method: 提出基于学习的方法论，使用不同损失函数。

Result: 文档未提及。

Conclusion: 文档未提及。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty
surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are
usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the
covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could
impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the
filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a
challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and
difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try
identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm
involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been
utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement
models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions
to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for
real-time vehicle state estimation

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks
with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically,
we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between
the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and
allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In
the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter
$n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order
$n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

Result: 在三个模拟设置和真实数据集上，Sbnet方法比现有方法表现更好。

Conclusion: Sbnet方法能有效解决平均治疗效果估计问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and
outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从输入 - 输出数据识别线性时变（LTV）系统这一基础且具有挑战性的不适定逆问题。

Method: 引入统一贝叶斯框架，将系统脉冲响应建模为随机过程，分解为后验均值和随机波动项，利用贝叶斯神经网络和高斯过程等机器学习技术及可扩展变分推理进行推理。

Result: 能从单个噪声观测中稳健推断LTI系统属性，在模拟环境噪声层析问题中数据效率优于经典方法，可通过结构化高斯过程先验跟踪连续变化的LTV脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 该工作为动态环境中考虑不确定性的系统识别提供了灵活且稳健的方法。

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦逻辑模型，理论证明PbP策略在不同缺失数据场景下能近似贝叶斯概率，实证比较多种方法，为含缺失值的逻辑回归分析提供全面视角并给出不同样本量下的方法建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在参数模型中，利用部分缺失输入进行响应预测具有挑战性，现有研究多关注线性模型，本文聚焦逻辑模型。

Method: 理论上证明Pattern - by - Pattern（PbP）策略在不同缺失数据场景（MCAR、MAR和MNAR）下能准确近似贝叶斯概率；实证上对多种方法（常量和迭代插补、完整案例分析、PbP和EM算法）在分类、概率估计、校准和参数推断方面进行全面比较。

Result: 小样本量时均值插补可作基线，非线性多重迭代插补技术（MICE.RF.Y）性能更优；大样本量时，对于高斯混合数据，PbP是最佳方法，存在非线性特征时推荐MICE.RF.Y。

Conclusion: 研究为含缺失值的逻辑回归提供了全面分析，给出不同样本量下适用的方法。

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging
task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

TL;DR: 提出无优化切片分布解决SGW距离问题，引入RAPD、RASD、RASGW及变体，理论分析并实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGW距离切片机制因无信息方向产生不必要计算成本，影响距离代表性，且寻找合适切片分布有计算成本和采样成本。

Method: 引入Relation - Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD)，推导Relation - Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD)，提出RASGW距离及其变体。

Result: 理论分析了RASGW及其变体的性质，通过大量实验验证了其在各种对齐任务中的能力。

Conclusion: RASGW及其变体克服了SGW的缺点，在对齐任务中表现良好。

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

TL;DR: 提出mNARX+算法自动构建mNARX模型序列，减少对领域专业知识的依赖，经案例验证能为复杂动力系统创建准确稳定的替代模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决mNARX模型依赖领域专业知识识别辅助量及其因果顺序的局限。

Method: 采用数据驱动的递归算法，通过与模型预测残差的相关性顺序选择时间特征，自动识别关键辅助量及其建模顺序。

Result: 在两个案例研究中证明该算法能为复杂动力系统创建准确稳定的替代模型。

Conclusion: 该算法为复杂动力系统提供了系统的数据驱动建模方法。

Abstract: We propose an automatic approach for manifold nonlinear autoregressive with
exogenous inputs (mNARX) modeling that leverages the feature-based structure of
functional-NARX (F-NARX) modeling. This novel approach, termed mNARX+,
preserves the key strength of the mNARX framework, which is its expressivity
allowing it to model complex dynamical systems, while simultaneously addressing
a key limitation: the heavy reliance on domain expertise to identify relevant
auxiliary quantities and their causal ordering. Our method employs a
data-driven, recursive algorithm that automates the construction of the mNARX
model sequence. It operates by sequentially selecting temporal features based
on their correlation with the model prediction residuals, thereby automatically
identifying the most critical auxiliary quantities and the order in which they
should be modeled. This procedure significantly reduces the need for prior
system knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the mNARX+ algorithm on
two case studies: a Bouc-Wen oscillator with strong hysteresis and a complex
aero-servo-elastic wind turbine simulator. The results show that the algorithm
provides a systematic, data-driven method for creating accurate and stable
surrogate models for complex dynamical systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程分析大数据集计算成本高，Vecchia近似可降低复杂度，但缺少GPU软件，因此研究在GPU上实现Vecchia近似。

Method: 对比三种在GPU上实现Vecchia近似的方法，研究内存类型对性能的影响并优化新方法，将其集成到GpGpU R包。

Result: 新方法优于其他两种，GpGpU在多个数据集上实现更快运行时间和更好的预测精度。

Conclusion: 在GPU上实现Vecchia近似是可行的，GpGpU在高斯过程模型拟合方面具有优势。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial
statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because
of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly.
Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and
can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core
software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R
package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is
lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine
learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on
a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process
approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is
investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our
new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R
package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software
by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large
spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing
satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better
predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习RCC框架存在目标标签翻转攻击漏洞，而相关研究缺失，需要解决该安全问题。

Method: 1. 揭示现有FL - RCC系统对TLFAs的脆弱性；2. 引入基于标签距离的度量量化安全风险；3. 提出防御机制FLARE。

Result: 通过多任务、多指标、多基线和多模型的实验，证明了TLFAs对FL - RCC系统的严重性以及FLARE缓解攻击影响的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有FL - RCC系统易受TLFAs攻击，提出的度量和防御机制FLARE能有效应对攻击。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去三年，Prompt injection攻击对大语言模型集成系统构成严重安全威胁，新兴代理AI系统改变了威胁格局。

Method: 基于Preamble的基础研究和缓解技术，结合跨站脚本（XSS）、跨站请求伪造（CSRF）等Web安全漏洞进行分析，并纳入近期基准测试。

Result: 传统的Web应用防火墙、XSS过滤器和CSRF令牌在应对AI增强攻击时失效。

Conclusion: 提出结合提示隔离、运行时安全和权限分离的架构解决方案，具备新颖的威胁检测能力。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

Method: 采用特定任务损失引导和残差向量量化损失，对已训练语音/音频下游模型中间特征进行压缩量化。

Result: 实现低于200 bps的超低比特率，下游模型性能损失小，生成的分词器可灵活部署。

Conclusion: 方法在自动语音识别和音频分类中有效，经适当正则化有更广泛任务和架构适用性。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs, leveraging quantization algorithms, have significantly
impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model
sizes for flexible deployment. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition and
audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate
regularization.

Abstract: Physical modelling synthesis aims to generate audio from physical simulations
of vibrating structures. Thin elastic plates are a common model for drum
membranes. Traditional numerical methods like finite differences and finite
elements offer high accuracy but are computationally demanding, limiting their
use in real-time audio applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis
of neural network-based approaches for solving the vibration of nonlinear
elastic plates. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, trained on short
sequences, for prediction of long sequences in an autoregressive fashion. We
show some of the limitations of these models, and why is not enough to look at
the prediction error in the time domain. We discuss the implications for
real-time audio synthesis and propose future directions for improving neural
approaches to model nonlinear vibration.

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of
real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法和实现的系统在验证大语言模型生成代码的正确性方面有较好效果。

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典机器学习和深度学习在处理高维生物医学数据和大规模数据集时存在计算和性能局限，需要新方法提升痴呆检测模型性能。

Method: 采用量子迁移学习（QTL）对痴呆检测的二元分类任务中的弱经典深度学习模型进行性能提升，并研究噪声对QTL方法的影响。

Result: 利用OASIS 2数据集，证明量子技术能将次优经典模型转化为更有效的生物医学图像分类解决方案。

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle
with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly
reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,
quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims
to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the
performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary
classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of
noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness
of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can
transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for
biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on
advancing healthcare technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子噪声是量子联邦学习（QFL）的重大障碍，现代量子设备存在噪声异质性，导致训练性能不足。

Method: 提出SpoQFL框架，利用零星学习，根据噪声波动动态调整训练策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，SpoQFL显著优于传统QFL方法，训练性能更优，收敛更稳定。

Conclusion: SpoQFL能有效缓解分布式量子系统中的量子噪声异质性，提高模型性能和学习效率。

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and
sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training
performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全原子分子动力学（AAMD）计算成本高，现有CGMD方法难以兼顾特定领域应用的准确性和计算速度。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化方法，针对特定领域应用优化Martini3拓扑结构中的键相互作用参数。

Result: 开发并验证了适用于任意聚合度的CG势，基于Martini3框架的优化CG势在保持CGMD计算效率的同时，可达到与AAMD相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了多尺度分子模拟中效率与准确性的差距，有望在多领域实现更快速、低成本的分子发现。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies
specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained
mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization
methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any
degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.
Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and
cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解决圣彼得堡悖论的方法引入的辅助假设涉及数学细化，可能与人们实际感知和处理数值信息的方式不符，因此需探索新方法。

Method: 基于对结果空间的粗划分定义改进的加法运算，将精确数值分组到感知类别中，用组内代表元素替代原数值再相加。

Result: 证明在合适构造的划分下，圣彼得堡级数在这种粗加法下能达到惯性稳定。

Conclusion: 虽不是悖论的最终解决方案，但该框架为认知精度有限的主体处理不同奖励结构提供了可行方式，且可能在行为建模和感知受限下的机器推理研究中有更广泛应用。

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏将皮层柱与重复神经模块架构联系起来的全面综述，旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 综合历史、理论和方法论视角研究神经模块重复，区分架构重复和参数共享模块重复。

Result: 参数共享模块重复有集体智能特性，重复模块倾向成为通用模块，实证显示可泛化到分布外问题，但理论结果不足。

Conclusion: 模块重复架构是新兴且待探索的策略，采用集体智能优势并遵循微柱架构和功能原则的系统或能挑战现代AI的可扩展性、能耗和民主化问题。

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the
pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.
This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's
structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as
a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective
intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive
reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural
modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,
theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We
distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and
parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated
across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,
adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module
tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers
capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may
offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy
efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust
embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such
systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are
still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an
emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped
potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a
system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and
functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI
problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

Abstract: Background/Introduction: In this paper, the neural network class of
Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) is investigated in terms of its theoretical and
applied validity for cognitive modelling, particularly of neurodevelopmental
disorders.
  Methods: A modified SOM network type, with increased biological plausibility,
incorporating a type of cortical columnar oscillation in the form of an
oscillating Topological Neighbourhood (TN), is introduced and applied alongside
the standard SOM. Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and
schizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing
neurocomputational theories. Both standard and oscillating-TN SOM training is
employed with targeted modifications in the TN width function. Computer
simulations are conducted using revised versions of a previously introduced
model (IPSOM) based on a new modelling hypothesis.
  Results/Conclusions: The results demonstrate that there is strong similarity
between standard and oscillating-TN SOM modelling in terms of map formation
behaviour, output and structure, while the oscillating version offers a more
realistic computational analogue of brain function. Neuroscientific and
computational arguments are presented to validate the proposed SOM modification
within a cognitive modelling framework.

Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法不一定能反映语义相似性，需更好的科学文本语义嵌入学习方法。

Method: 基于文本嵌入对比学习进展，利用LLM生成科学摘要训练模型，使语义相关摘要在嵌入空间更接近。

Result: 在新提出的基准中显示出更强语义分离能力，在SciRepEval基准上同规模模型中达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: 突出了语义聚焦训练方法的好处。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽有强大跨模态推理能力，但面临对抗性多模态输入时存在新的安全问题，需提升推理时安全性。

Method: 引入模块化和自适应的推理时干预技术AutoSteer，包含安全意识分数、自适应安全探测器和轻量级拒绝头三个核心组件。

Result: 在LLaVA - OV和Chameleon上的实验表明，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率，同时保持了通用能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer是一个实用、可解释且有效的框架，有助于多模态AI系统的安全部署。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Motivation: 自然语言处理和大语言模型推动人力资本管理变革，但该领域缺乏可靠公平模型及公开基准数据，为填补此空白开展TalentCLEF 2025。

Method: 举办TalentCLEF 2025评估活动，设置两个任务，构建真实且经过处理标注的语料库，进行单语和跨语言评估并关注性别偏见。

Result: 吸引76个注册团队超280份提交，多数系统采用基于多语言编码器模型结合对比学习的信息检索技术，部分融入大语言模型，结果显示训练策略影响更大。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF提供该领域首个公开基准，鼓励劳动力市场开发稳健、公平、可迁移的语言技术。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Conclusion: MSA能反映人们对全局相关变量进行局部连贯推理的能力，为理解和复制开放式领域的人类推理提供途径。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Conclusion: 提出了一种计算高效的方法，可在极少或无额外训练下激发大模型的长推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

Result: Synergy生成概念标记少于BBPE分词器，性能相当；相同规模和数据集下优于Llama3；移除位置编码时模型中间部分表现更好。

Conclusion: 无分词器架构可行，为更强大灵活的管道铺平道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

Conclusion: 揭示了大语言模型在符号音乐生成能力方面的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

Motivation: 受人类分层思维能力启发，构建不同层同时解码文本的分层解码器架构。

Method: 将最后一层的语言头复制到选定的中间层，并使用不同任务输入进行微调。

Result: 选定的中间层能输出有意义合理的内容，分层解码器在多个任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明存在从零预训练通用分层推理器的可能性。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IberLEF 2025任务PRESTA中关于西班牙语表格问答的问题。

Method: 基于Semeval 2025相关任务的MRT实现进行改进，采用多步骤流程，利用开源大语言模型和细粒度优化提示，包括分析理解表格、选列、生成自然语言指令、转代码、运行及处理异常。

Result: 在该任务中获得了85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的通过LLM生成Python代码处理表格获取答案的方法在IberLEF 2025任务PRESTA中有效。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

### [166] [HATS: Hindi Analogy Test Set for Evaluating Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13238)
*Ashray Gupta,Rohan Joseph,Sunny Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入新的印地语类比测试集HATS评估大语言模型推理能力，采用多种提示策略和接地思维链方法，发现英文提示效果最佳，解决了印地语评估资源缺乏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在英语推理能力评估较多，印地语能力研究不足，需评估其跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 引入包含405道选择题的Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS)，用多种提示策略对多语言大语言模型进行基准测试，引入基于类比推理认知理论的接地思维链方法。

Result: 实验表明无论提示策略如何，模型在英文提示下表现最佳，且接地思维链方法提升了模型在印地语类比问题上的性能。

Conclusion: 测试集弥补了评估大语言模型印地语推理能力关键资源的缺失。

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

Motivation: 现有强化学习在提升大语言推理模型多步推理能力，尤其是处理难题时效果不佳。

Method: 提出Question Augmentation策略QuestA，在训练中引入部分解决方案以降低问题难度，提供更多信息学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务的强化学习训练中，不仅提高了pass@1和pass@k，在标准强化学习难以取得进展的问题上也有效果；在数学基准测试中取得新的最优结果，如AIME24达到67.1%（提升5.3%）等。

Conclusion: QuestA提高了样本效率，为通过强化学习扩展推理能力提供了实用且可推广的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在为科学研究设计消融研究方面的能力，以及解决现有自动评估方法不可靠的问题。

Method: 创建包含1500个来自807篇NLP论文的专家标注示例的基准AbGen，对领先大语言模型进行评估；开发元评估基准AbGen - Eval来评估常用自动评估系统的可靠性。

Result: 领先大语言模型与人类专家在消融研究设计上有显著性能差距，现有自动评估方法与人类评估有显著差异。

Conclusion: 为开发更有效可靠的基于大语言模型的复杂科学任务评估系统的未来研究提供了见解。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Motivation: 探讨VL训练是否以有意义的方式改变语言模型的语言表征，聚焦于词汇 - 概念知识的分类组织。

Method: 对比纯文本语言模型和VL训练模型，进行文本问答任务，并开展行为和表征分析。

Result: VL模型在需要分类学理解的问答任务上表现更优；LMs和VLMs分类学知识无显著差异，但问题表征有差异。

Conclusion: VL训练不显著改变分类学知识本身，但能提升特定纯语言任务中该知识的应用。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

Conclusion: 该矩阵表示蕴含聚类信息，尤其对稀疏有向图。

Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis.
Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate
directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these
matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we
propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of
the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed
matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected
graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and
the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this
matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse
directed graphs.

Motivation: Transformers计算需求大，难以在低功耗边缘设备部署。

Method: 引入超低功耗CGRA架构，集成4x4 PE阵列用于并行计算、4x2 MOB用于优化LOAD/STORE操作，采用无开关网状环形互连网络。

Result: 该架构通过异构阵列设计和高效数据流，满足Transformer独特计算需求。

Conclusion: 该架构为在边缘设备部署复杂机器学习模型提供可扩展途径。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

TL;DR: 提出用于共形预测（CP）的差分隐私方法P - COQS，实验表明其对隐私噪声有鲁棒性，在多方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数差分隐私（DP）方法关注训练数据的隐私泄露，较少考虑校准数据集的隐私泄露，本文旨在为CP提供通用DP方法。

Method: 在CP校准阶段采用随机化二分搜索算法计算DP分位数，保证后续预测集的隐私性。

Result: P - COQS对隐私噪声有鲁棒性，在经验覆盖、效率和信息性方面优于现有DP方法，能产生更小的共形预测集。

Conclusion: P - COQS在多种实验设置中能同时实现期望的覆盖范围和隐私保证。

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage
from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer
approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset
which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal
Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this
direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call
Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts
an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in
the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent
prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with
respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample
calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS
generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming
properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage
guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine
the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the
performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we
empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method
is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current
DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.
Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal
prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy
guarantees in all these experimental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ATE和CATE不能捕获个体层面不确定性，ITE根本不可识别限制个体层面不确定性估计，为高风险决策提供有效的个体治疗效应估计的预测区间。

Method: 研究跨世界相关参数ρ，利用领域专家知识施加合理可解释的界限，基于ρ设计ITE预测区间。

Result: 构建的预测区间覆盖更稳定准确，宽度大大缩短，常小于竞争方法的1/3，满足覆盖保证，在高斯假设下渐近最优。

Conclusion: 跨世界假设能使个体不确定性量化既有实际信息价值又有统计有效性。

Abstract: While average treatment effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) provide valuable population- and subgroup-level summaries, they
fail to capture uncertainty at the individual level. For high-stakes
decision-making, individual treatment effect (ITE) estimates must be
accompanied by valid prediction intervals that reflect heterogeneity and
unit-specific uncertainty. However, the fundamental unidentifiability of ITEs
limits the ability to derive precise and reliable individual-level uncertainty
estimates. To address this challenge, we investigate the role of a cross-world
correlation parameter, $ \rho(x) = cor(Y(1), Y(0) | X = x) $, which describes
the dependence between potential outcomes, given covariates, in the
Neyman-Rubin super-population model with i.i.d. units. Although $ \rho $ is
fundamentally unidentifiable, we argue that in most real-world applications, it
is possible to impose reasonable and interpretable bounds informed by
domain-expert knowledge. Given $\rho$, we design prediction intervals for ITE,
achieving more stable and accurate coverage with substantially shorter widths;
often less than 1/3 of those from competing methods. The resulting intervals
satisfy coverage guarantees $P\big(Y(1) - Y(0) \in C_{ITE}(X)\big) \geq 1 -
\alpha$ and are asymptotically optimal under Gaussian assumptions. We provide
strong theoretical and empirical arguments that cross-world assumptions can
make individual uncertainty quantification both practically informative and
statistically valid.

Result: 在Yearbook数据集上作为微调步骤应用时，RIDER持续提高样本外预测性能；在预测股市波动率和纽约出租车行程时长两个实际任务中，RIDER优于标准加权策略。

Conclusion: RIDER方法在处理时间分布偏移问题上有效，能提升机器学习模型的预测性能。

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models
trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper
introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which
derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

Motivation: 探究第三方信贷担保对企业贷款的影响以及在信贷市场中的作用。

Method: 使用考虑时变企业和贷款人效应的实证策略进行研究。

Result: 第三方信贷担保与贷款风险、贷款利率和贷款拖欠呈负相关，能缓解抵押约束，资产价值受负向冲击的企业更倾向用信贷担保而非抵押品。

Conclusion: 第三方信贷担保在企业贷款和信贷市场中具有积极作用，尤其对小企业有益。

Abstract: Using a comprehensive dataset collected by the Federal Reserve, I find that
over one-third of corporate loans issued by US banks are fully guaranteed by
legal entities separate from borrowing firms. Using an empirical strategy that
accounts for time-varying firm and lender effects, I find that the existence of
a third-party credit guarantee is negatively related to loan risk, loan rate,
and loan delinquency. Third party credit guarantees alleviate the effect of
collateral constraints in credit market. Firms (particularly smaller firms)
that experience a negative shock to their asset values are less likely to use
collateral and more likely to use credit guarantees in new borrowings.

Motivation: 加拿大银行业无政府救助历史且自20世纪20年代有隐性政府担保，借此研究市场纪律和改革前景。

Method: 采用综合数据集和多种方法，控制银行特定和市场风险因素，分析大型银行债务发行的市场数据。

Result: 大型银行在控制风险因素后有融资优势，存款和次级债务平均少付80和70个基点；市场纪律存在于次级债务，不存在于高级债务。

Conclusion: 加拿大大型银行存在融资优势，不同类型债务的市场纪律表现不同。

Abstract: We employ a comprehensive data set and a variety of methods to provide
evidence on the magnitude of large banks' funding advantage in Canada in
addition to the extent to which market discipline exists across different
securities issued by the Canadian banks. The banking sector in Canada provides
a unique setting in which to examine market discipline along with the prospects
of proposed reforms because Canada has no history of government bailouts, and
an implicit government guarantee has been in effect consistently since the
1920s. We find that large banks have a funding advantage over small banks after
controlling for bank-specific and market risk factors. Large banks on average
pay 80 basis points and 70 basis points less, respectively, on their deposits
and subordinated debt. Working with hand-collected market data on debt issues
by large banks, we also find that market discipline exists for subordinated
debt and not for senior debt.

Motivation: 构建双边市场势力下企业间贸易的议价理论，研究议价和网络刚性对价格结果的影响。

Method: 构建理论框架，结合美国进口数据进行估计。

Result: 估计出美国进口商有强议价能力、出口供给曲线向上倾斜；2018年关税传递不完全，主要因主导买家需求下降使出口商降低成本。

Conclusion: 议价和网络刚性塑造价格结果，对全球价值链中加价分散和冲击传播有影响。

Abstract: This paper develops a theory of bargaining in firm-to-firm trade with
two-sided market power. The framework accommodates flexible market structures,
yielding analytical expressions for pair-specific markups and pass-through
elasticities. In U.S. import data, we estimate strong importer bargaining power
and an upward-sloping export supply curve, consistent with oligopsony power.
Pass-through of the 2018 tariffs in firm-to-firm relationships is incomplete,
in contrast to product-level studies, primarily due to exporter cost reductions
driven by falling demand from dominant buyers. Our study highlights how
bargaining and network rigidities shape price outcomes, with implications for
markup dispersion and shock propagation in global value chains.

Method: 使用1990年以来52个工业和新兴经济体的预算数据，采用考虑横截面依赖和异质性财政行为的面板方法。

Result: 具有税收平滑动机和对债务响应的基本余额规则对财政行为有很强的解释力；债务与GDP比率提高10个百分点，长期基本盈余与GDP比率平均提高0.5个百分点；不同债务水平和不同类型经济体都有纠正性调整。

Conclusion: 许多政府奉行李嘉图式政策设计，避免庞氏融资。

Abstract: Do governments adjust budgetary policy to rising public debt, precluding
fiscal unsustainability? Using budget data for 52 industrial and emerging
economies since 1990, we apply panel methods accounting for cross-sectional
dependence and heterogeneous fiscal conduct. We find that a primary-balance
rule with tax-smoothing motives and responsiveness to debt has robust
explanatory power in describing fiscal behavior. Controlling for temporary
output, temporary spending, and the current account balance, a
10-percentage-point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio raises the long-run
primary surplus-to-GDP ratio by 0.5 percentage points on average. Corrective
adjustments hold across high- and low-debt countries and across industrial and
emerging economies. Our results imply many governments pursue Ricardian policy
designs, avoiding Ponzi-type financing.

Motivation: 探究贿赂存在时企业的生产、进入和技术决策，挑战贿赂统一有害的既定观点。

Method: 记录148个国家不同技术企业贿赂的异质性并纳入一般均衡模型分析。

Result: 当贿赂更多影响低效劳动密集型企业时，资源流向高效资本密集型企业，提高资本积累和总产出；部分消除资本密集型企业贿赂比完全消除贿赂对资本和产出提升更多，且在富裕国家提升幅度更大。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了贿赂统一有害的既定观点。

Abstract: We study the production, entry, and technological decisions of firms in the
presence of bribery. We find that bribery can be justified even in the absence
of bureaucratic inefficiencies. We document substantial technology-specific
heterogeneity in bribery in 148 countries and incorporate it into a general
equilibrium model, where firms use capital-intensive or labor-intensive
technology. When bribery more heavily affects less efficient labor-intensive
firms, resources move toward more efficient capital-intensive firms, resulting
in higher capital accumulation and aggregate output. In poorer countries, the
elimination of bribery only for capital-intensive firms increases the capital
stock by 18.7% more and the aggregate output by 3.4% more than the complete
elimination of bribery. In wealthier countries, the elimination of bribery only
for capital-intensive firms increases the capital stock by 44.4% more and the
aggregate output by 15.4% more than the complete elimination of bribery. Our
findings challenge the established view of bribery as uniformly harmful.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLU方法为各任务使用单独模型架构，增加系统复杂性、限制跨任务交互且无法充分利用异构数据集。

Method: 提出统一框架UniSLU，构建统一表示以利用异构数据集，提出统一生成方法联合建模多个任务并与大语言模型集成。

Result: 在公共SLU数据集上实验表明，该方法比多个基准方法有更优的SLU性能。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机哈密顿蒙特卡罗在临界状态可加速收敛，但手动临界调参不可行，已有自动算法如No - U - turn Sampler，缺乏对其加速收敛能力的严格研究。

Method: 结合测度集中方法研究自动调参机制，采用基于耦合的混合分析方法分析哈密顿蒙特卡罗。

Result: 在某些高斯目标分布下，对采样器行为给出精确刻画。

Conclusion: 得到严格的混合保证，描述了算法在实现加速收敛方面的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress on the theory of variational hypocoercivity established that
Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo -- at criticality -- can achieve pronounced
acceleration in its convergence and hence sampling performance over diffusive
dynamics. Manual critical tuning being unfeasible in practice has motivated
automated algorithmic solutions, notably the No-U-turn Sampler. Beyond its
empirical success, a rigorous study of this method's ability to achieve
accelerated convergence has been missing. We initiate this investigation
combining a concentration of measure approach to examine the automatic tuning
mechanism with a coupling based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In
certain Gaussian target distributions, this yields a precise characterization
of the sampler's behavior resulting, in particular, in rigorous mixing
guarantees describing the algorithm's ability and limitations in achieving
accelerated convergence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球人口老龄化，AI 代理用于老年人护理，需解决其与老年人自主偏好一致的问题。

Method: 借鉴跨学科自主性概念，研究老年人自主的四个关键维度。

Result: 提出三个研究方向：解决社会责任自主性、从任务角度实现代理自主性、开发自主性度量方法。

Conclusion: 指出解决代理与老年人自主偏好一致问题的研究方向。

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新冠疫情带来多方面影响，虽不再是全球卫生紧急事件但影响仍在，利用疫情数据改进预测模型可提升应对未来疫情的能力。

Method: 以塞浦路斯为例，利用包含流行病学数据、疫苗接种记录、政策措施和天气条件的两年数据集进行大规模案例研究，分析感染趋势、评估预测性能和研究外部因素对疾病动态的影响。

Result: 获得了关于疾病动态、预测性能和外部因素影响的相关见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于改进大流行的准备和应对策略。

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health,
economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights
gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机科学和统计学的核心问题是高效算法能否达到统计问题的信息论极限，以往计算 - 统计权衡多基于平均情况假设，本文尝试基于标准最坏情况假设（NP - 硬度）研究PAC学习中的此类权衡。

Method: 基于NP需要指数时间的假设进行推导，分析样本复杂度等参数。

Result: 得到尖锐的计算 - 统计权衡；用学习来刻画RP和NP的关系；所有下界对非恰当学习器成立，是多项式规模电路子类非恰当学习的首个NP - 硬度结果。

Conclusion: 在PAC学习中基于NP - 硬度成功获得计算 - 统计权衡，突破了之前的形式障碍。

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of deep residual networks for
predicting the dynamics of interacting three-dimensional rigid bodies. We
present a framework combining a 3D physics simulator implemented in C++ with a
deep learning model constructed using PyTorch. The simulator generates training
data encompassing linear and angular motion, elastic collisions, fluid
friction, gravitational effects, and damping. Our deep residual network,
consisting of an input layer, multiple residual blocks, and an output layer, is
designed to handle the complexities of 3D dynamics. We evaluate the network's
performance using a datasetof 10,000 simulated scenarios, each involving 3-5
interacting rigid bodies. The model achieves a mean squared error of 0.015 for
position predictions and 0.022 for orientation predictions, representing a 25%
improvement over baseline methods. Our results demonstrate the network's
ability to capture intricate physical interactions, with particular success in
predicting elastic collisions and rotational dynamics. This work significantly
contributes to physics-informed machine learning by showcasing the immense

(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected

Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在处理如预测自我中心运动后场景外观等简单的3D空间推理任务时存在困难，缺乏3D动态内部模型。

Method: 提出MindJourney测试时扩展框架，将视觉语言模型与基于视频扩散的可控世界模型耦合，VLM迭代绘制简洁相机轨迹，世界模型合成对应视图，VLM基于多视图证据推理。

Result: 在代表性空间推理基准测试SAT上平均性能提升超8%，优于通过强化学习训练的测试时推理VLMs。

Conclusion: 将视觉语言模型与世界模型配对进行测试时扩展为实现稳健3D推理提供了简单、即插即用的途径，利用世界模型进行测试时扩展的方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Motivation: 现有MS - DGCNN方法无法捕捉树结构层次间语义关系，难以应对森林环境复杂多尺度几何结构进行树种分类。

Method: 提出MS - DGCNN++分层多尺度融合动态图卷积网络，在局部、分支和树冠尺度进行语义特征提取与跨尺度信息传播，采用特定尺度特征工程。

Conclusion: 方法参数少、复杂度低，适用于资源受限应用，可泛化到3D物体识别，是通用点云处理解决方案。

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于像素的方法在UMIS中因缺乏对象级解剖洞察和器官间关系建模，难以应对形态复杂性和特征冲突，效果有限。

Method: 提出Mamba Snake框架，将多轮廓演化构建为分层状态空间图谱，引入Mamba Evolution Block进行自适应细化，利用能量图形状先验确保轮廓稳健演化，加入双分类协同机制优化检测和分割。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上进行评估，Mamba Snake平均Dice比现有方法提高3%。

Conclusion: Mamba Snake框架在UMIS中表现优异，能有效解决传统方法面临的问题。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stable diffusion图像生成模型因注意力操作的二次复杂度导致生成过程耗时，现有令牌合并方法未充分考虑基于注意力的图像生成模型特性，效果受限。

Method: 提出ReToM策略，定义注意力输入中的局部边界为窗口并调整窗口大小，通过计算特定时间步的相似度选出最具代表性的令牌，以此合并令牌。

Result: 与基线相比，ReToM使FID提升6.2%，CLIP分数更高，推理时间相近。

Conclusion: ReToM能有效平衡视觉质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用于场景理解的大型视觉语言模型主要关注室内家居任务，应用于户外大规模场景理解时存在对户外大规模环境分析不足、缺乏多领域感知户外数据及难以有效整合2D和3D视觉信息等问题。

Method: 构建多领域感知户外场景理解数据集SVM - City，引入不完全多模态学习来建模户外场景理解，设计LVLM模型City - VLM，通过构建联合概率分布空间实现多模态融合。

Result: 在三个典型户外场景理解任务的实验中，City - VLM在问答任务中平均性能比现有LVLMs高出18.14%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在多个户外场景中展现出实用和泛化性能。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法的Q&A对以事件为中心，缺乏必要细节，限制模型泛化和推理能力。

Method: 提出FIQ方法，基于视频描述生成Q&A对丰富训练数据，引入VQ - CAlign模块辅助问题嵌入与视觉特征结合。

Result: 在SUTD - TrafficQA实验中，FIQ比现有基线方法取得了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FIQ方法能增强模型对视频的基本理解，提升泛化性和推理能力，且适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

Abstract: Food is not only a core component of humans' daily diets, but also an
important carrier of cultural heritage and emotional bonds. With the
development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images
has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However,
existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when
dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in
detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for
classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet),
specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately
capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets
ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved
classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to
present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image

Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated.
We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image
datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates
potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

Result: 所提方法在各种下游任务中优于现有的3D - LMMs。

Conclusion: Argus框架能弥补3D点云重建时的信息丢失，帮助大语言模型更好地理解3D世界。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DMQ方法有效解决扩散模型量化问题，在低比特率下表现良好，代码开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Conclusion: 细粒度策略和元数据融合能有效提升手腕病理诊断准确率。

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Conclusion: DINO - VO解决了视觉基础模型在视觉里程计中的集成问题，具有良好的鲁棒性、精度、泛化性和运行效率。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: SE - VLN作为VLN的自进化代理框架有很大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Conclusion: 揭示了生成式AI在解决DNN训练数据稀缺问题上的潜力和弱点。

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Motivation: 追求可泛化的立体匹配模型，解决迭代局部搜索方法缺乏全局一致性、全局匹配架构计算和内存成本高的问题。

Method: 设计S^2M^2架构，集成多分辨率变压器，使用新的损失函数训练。

Result: S^2M^2在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中建立新的最优表现，多数指标远超先前方法。

Conclusion: S^2M^2能在不依赖成本体过滤或深度细化堆栈的情况下，实现高精度和高效率的立体匹配。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 传统流匹配和扩散策略在视觉运动控制中需额外条件机制，存在时空开销，且学习视觉和动作跨模态流有挑战。

Method: 以潜图像为流源，用自编码器创建结构化动作潜空间，通过流潜解码监督流匹配，采用简单MLP层实现。

Result: MLP-only的VITA在ALOHA平台的双手机器人操作任务中，表现优于或等同于现有生成策略，推理延迟降低50 - 130%。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅用MLP就能解决如ALOHA基准中复杂双手机器人操作任务的流匹配策略。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Method: 提出Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT)策略，用单个可学习向量生成近似正交向量构成下/上投影矩阵。

Result: 方法在一系列下游图像分类任务中取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: AOFT策略有效提升了下/上投影矩阵的泛化能力。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance.
While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting,

for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel
State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network
(DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an
in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric
signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves
competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its
effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

Result: 在DIR - LAB数据集上评估，cIDIR实现了高精度和高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR框架能有效解决DIR框架中正则化参数微调的计算成本问题，具有良好的配准效果。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 基于方差的剪枝方法能高效压缩网络，减少大量重新训练需求。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Conclusion: DISSect方法能准确高效判别噪声对应关系，加速训练，有较好效果。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: VisionThink是一种有效动态处理不同分辨率样本的视觉标记压缩方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung

that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Conclusion: 小批量耦合能有效调整分层流匹配中不同层级分布复杂度。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

Abstract: We introduce a new method for analyzing midpoint discretizations of
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are frequently used in Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from a target measure $\pi
\propto \exp(-V)$. Borrowing techniques from Malliavin calculus, we compute
estimates for the Radon-Nikodym derivative for processes on $L^2([0, T);
\mathbb{R}^d)$ which may anticipate the Brownian motion, in the sense that they
may not be adapted to the filtration at the same time. Applying these to
various popular midpoint discretizations, we are able to improve the regularity
and cross-regularity results in the literature on sampling methods. We also
obtain a query complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\kappa^{5/4}
d^{1/4}}{\varepsilon^{1/2}})$ for obtaining a $\varepsilon^2$-accurate sample
in $\mathsf{KL}$ divergence, under log-concavity and strong smoothness
assumptions for $\nabla^2 V$.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental
efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.

Abstract: We verify the correctness of a variety of mutual exclusion algorithms through
model checking. We look at algorithms where communication is via shared
read/write registers, where those registers can be atomic or non-atomic. For
the verification of liveness properties, it is necessary to assume a
completeness criterion to eliminate spurious counterexamples. We use justness
as completeness criterion. Justness depends on a concurrency relation; we
consider several such relations, modelling different assumptions on the working
of the shared registers. We present executions demonstrating the violation of
correctness properties by several algorithms, and in some cases suggest
improvements.

Conclusion: 对SFOMs在弱凸目标函数下的两种梯度噪声收敛性有了更深入理解，同时发现样本复杂度方面的问题。

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预写日志（WAL）需兼顾可靠性和高性能，作者想基于Rust创建用户空间WAL原型以进行相关探索。

Method: 使用Rust创建用户空间WAL原型。

Result: 观察到Rust易用、紧凑、库丰富，WAL原型开销极小，性能基本符合稳定内存设备的预期。

Conclusion: Rust适合用于创建用户空间WAL，能在保证性能的同时具备一定优势。

Abstract: Write-ahead logs (WALs) are a fundamental fault-tolerance technique found in
many areas of computer science. WALs must be reliable while maintaining high
performance, because all operations will be written to the WAL to ensure their
stability. Without reliability a WAL is useless, because its utility is tied to
its ability to recover data after a failure. In this paper we describe our
experience creating a prototype user space WAL in Rust. We observed that Rust
is easy to use, compact and has a very rich set of libraries. More importantly,
we have found that the overhead is minimal, with the WAL prototype operating at
basically the expected performance of the stable memory device.

TL;DR: 分析大学生面向对象团队项目软件质量，为课程改进提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有教学重功能轻质量，文献对中级学生复杂项目质量指导有限。

Method: 分析172名学生4个版本课程的83个面向对象团队项目，用SonarQube和ArchUnit评估。

Result: 发现重复质量问题，明确学生面临挑战。

Conclusion: 为改进软件工程课程和促进质量导向开发实践提供指导。

Abstract: When teaching Programming and Software Engineering in Bachelor's Degree
programs, the emphasis on creating functional software projects often
overshadows the focus on software quality, a trend that aligns with ACM
curricula recommendations. Software Engineering courses are typically
introduced later in the curriculum, and can generally allocate only limited
time to quality-related topics, leaving educators with the challenge of
deciding which quality aspects to prioritize. In this decision, the literature
offers limited guidance, as most existing studies focus on code written by
novice students and small code units, making it unclear whether those findings
extend to intermediate-level students with foundational object-oriented
programming skills working on more complex software projects. To address this
gap, we analyze 83 object-oriented team projects developed by 172 university
students across 4 different editions of the Object-Oriented Programming course.
We apply a static analysis pipeline used in prior research to assess software
quality, combining SonarQube and ArchUnit to detect code smells and
architectural anti-patterns. Our findings highlight recurring quality issues
and offer concrete evidence of the challenges students face at this stage,
providing valuable guidance for educators aiming to continuously improve
Software Engineering curricula and promote quality-oriented development
practices.

Conclusion: 建模现实学生代码需要通过上下文感知生成、时间建模和多维度评估来捕捉学习动态。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming
tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

Motivation: 解决生成式AI系统给自由和开源软件社区带来的传统版权共享原则应用问题。

Method: 采用三部分评估框架，考察法律可行性、政策合理性以及跨环境利弊。

Result: CCAI许可有增强开发者控制、激励开源AI发展等优势，但开源AI有潜在风险。

Conclusion: 在关注负责任AI使用的监管环境中，CCAI许可可保留和适应FOSS核心原则以应对生成式AI发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI systems has created new challenges for the
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community, particularly regarding how
traditional copyleft principles should apply when open source code is used to
train AI models. This article introduces the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI)
license, a novel licensing mechanism that extends copyleft requirements from
training data to the resulting generative AI models. The CCAI license offers
significant advantages, including enhanced developer control, incentivization
of open source AI development, and mitigation of openwashing practices. This is
demonstrated through a structured three-part evaluation framework that examines
(1) legal feasibility under current copyright law, (2) policy justification
comparing traditional software and AI contexts, and (3) synthesis of
cross-contextual benefits and risks. However, the increased risk profile of
open source AI, particularly the potential for direct misuse, necessitates
complementary regulatory approaches to achieve an appropriate risk-benefit
balance. The paper concludes that when implemented within a robust regulatory
environment focused on responsible AI usage, the CCAI license provides a viable
mechanism for preserving and adapting core FOSS principles to the evolving
landscape of generative AI development.

Motivation: 探究在多智能体环境下，使用预测器在不同预测质量假设下能达到的最佳竞争比。

Method: 引入双预测框架，以多智能体滑雪租赁问题作为框架示例进行分析。

Result: 在完美他人预测的特定情况下，遵循自我预测器的算法是最优的，但对自身未来行为预测错误不鲁棒，给出了更具鲁棒性的算法并进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 提出的双预测框架可用于分析多智能体带预测算法，新算法具有更好鲁棒性。

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a
multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that
agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the
behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is
understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by
employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent
version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by
pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price
is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a
unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no
extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that
follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of
agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties
and benchmark it.

Conclusion: FOUNDER框架有效结合基础模型和世界模型，可用于具身环境无奖励开放式任务解决。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

Conclusion: VLMgineer框架在自动化工具发明方面有良好效果，有助于将复杂机器人问题简单化，后续将发布基准测试和代码以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖固定稀疏轨迹监督，难以捕捉人类驾驶的分层推理过程。

Method: 基于三层人类认知模型构建ReAL - AD框架，包含战略推理注入器、战术推理集成器和分层轨迹解码器，并融入视觉语言模型。

Result: 集成该框架使规划准确性和安全性提升超30%。

Conclusion: 该框架让端到端自动驾驶更具可解释性，符合人类分层推理。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Conclusion: GraspGen是解决6 - DOF抓取泛化问题的有效框架。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

Motivation: 传统强化学习在稀疏奖励条件下需手动设计复杂奖励函数，现有基于人类反馈的强化学习依赖显式反馈，干扰自然交互且增加用户认知负担。

Method: 提出基于隐式人类反馈的强化学习（RLIHF）框架，用预训练解码器将原始EEG信号转换为概率奖励分量。

Result: 在模拟环境中，用解码后的EEG反馈训练的智能体与用密集手动设计奖励训练的智能体性能相当。

Conclusion: 验证了在交互式机器人中使用隐式神经反馈进行可扩展且符合人类偏好的强化学习的潜力。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in

simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI

Conclusion: 该工作为自动驾驶中的VLM智能体引入了有前景的后训练范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide

dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Motivation: 在2 - 球上搜索Z/2本征函数。

Method: 创建多值版本的前馈深度神经网络，使用JAX库实现。

Result: 找到三种情况的Z/2本征函数，前两种固定分支点在四面体和立方体顶点，第三种让AI移动分支点，最终定位在压扁四面体顶点。

Conclusion: 通过创建的神经网络方法能有效在2 - 球上找到不同情况的Z/2本征函数。

Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the
2-sphere. For this we created a multivalued version of a feedforward deep
neural network, and we implemented it using the JAX library. We found Z/2
eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch
points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third
case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it
positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.
