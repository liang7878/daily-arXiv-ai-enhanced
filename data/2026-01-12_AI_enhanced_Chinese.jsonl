Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods. Beyond social choice, SP-Rank supports downstream applications in learning-to-rank, extracting expert knowledge from noisy crowds, and training reward models in preference-based fine-tuning pipelines. We release the dataset, code, and baseline evaluations (available at https://github.com/amrit19/SP-Rank-Dataset ) to foster research in human preference modeling, aggregation theory, and human-AI alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SP - Rank\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ec5\u6355\u6349\u4e2a\u4f53\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSP - Rank\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b12000\u591a\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e5d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u6295\u7968\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5SP - Voting\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u7968\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SP - Rank\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u548cGraphRAG\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTagRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cGraphRAG\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTagRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u7b7e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTagRAG\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u80dc\u738795.41%\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3aGraphRAG\u768414.6\u500d\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a1.9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TagRAG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi.

The environmental impacts of conventional production practices are assessed through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using the ReCiPe 2016 methodology at the Endpoint level. Agents are made aware of the environmental consequences of their choices through two indicators: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which capture human health impacts, and the number of species lost per year, reflecting impacts on ecosystems.

MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance.

DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous \"ragged filtration\" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent.

Parametric models with fixed nominal parameters often omit critical physical effects due to simplifications in geometry, material behavior, damping, or boundary conditions, resulting in model form errors (MFEs) that impair predictive accuracy. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for MFE estimation and correction in high-dimensional finite element (FE) based structural dynamical systems. The Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) represents discrepancies non-parametrically in the reduced modal domain, allowing a flexible data-driven characterization of unmodeled dynamics. A linear Bayesian filtering approach jointly estimates system states and discrepancies, incorporating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure computational tractability, the FE system is projected onto a reduced modal basis, and a mesh-invariant neural network maps modal states to discrepancy estimates, permitting model rectification across different FE discretizations without retraining. Validation is undertaken across five MFE scenarios-including incorrect beam theory, damping misspecification, misspecified boundary condition, unmodeled material nonlinearity, and local damage demonstrating the surrogate model's substantial reduction of displacement and rotation prediction errors under unseen excitations.

A typical model assumes that the conditional distribution of the response follows a von-Mises distribution. However, this assumption is inadequate when the response variable is multimodal. For this reason, in this paper, a finite mixture of regressions model is proposed for the case of a circular response variable and a set of circular and/or linear covariates. Mixture models are very useful when the underlying population is multimodal. Despite the prevalence of multimodality in regression modelling of circular data, the use of mixtures of regressions has received no attention in the literature. This paper aims to close this knowledge gap. To estimate the proposed model, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. An extensive simulation study is used to demonstrate the practical use and performance of the proposed model and estimation procedure.

To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker.

Users can express an operation in natural language (e.g., \"identify if this review mentions billing issues\"), with the system executing the operation on each document, in a row-by-row fashion. One way to reduce cost on a batch of documents is to employ the model cascade framework: a cheap proxy model processes each document, and only uncertain cases are escalated to a more accurate, expensive oracle. However, model cascades miss important optimization opportunities; for example, often only part of a document is needed to answer a query, or other related, but simpler operations (e.g., \"is the review sentiment negative?\", \"does the review mention money?\") can be handled by cheap models more effectively than the original operation, while still being correlated with it.\n  We introduce the task cascades framework, which generalizes model cascades by varying not just the model, but also the document portion and operation at each stage. Our framework uses an LLM agent to generate simplified, decomposed, or otherwise related operations and selects the most relevant document portions, constructing hundreds of candidate tasks from which it assembles a task cascade. We show that optimal cascade selection is intractable via reduction from Minimum Sum Set Cover, but our iterative approach constructs effective cascades. We also provide an extension that offers statistical accuracy guarantees: the resulting cascade meets a user-defined accuracy target (with respect to the oracle) up to a bounded failure probability.

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

Existing conditional inference methods lack this flexibility as they are tied to a fixed conditioning structure and cannot perform new conditional inference once trained. To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds.

Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.\n  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy.

However, existing FDG methods typically struggle with cross-client data heterogeneity and incur significant communication and computation overhead. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new FDG framework, dubbed FaST-PT, which facilitates local feature augmentation and efficient unseen domain adaptation in a distributed manner. First, we propose a lightweight Multi-Modal Style Transfer (MST) method to transform image embedding under text supervision, which could expand the training data distribution and mitigate domain shift. We then design a dual-prompt module that decomposes the prompt into global and domain prompts. Specifically, global prompts capture general knowledge from augmented embedding across clients, while domain prompts capture domain-specific knowledge from local data. Besides, Domain-aware Prompt Generation (DPG) is introduced to adaptively generate suitable prompts for each sample, which facilitates unseen domain adaptation through knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets, e.g., PACS and DomainNet, demonstrate the superior performance of FaST-PT over SOTA FDG methods such as FedDG-GA and DiPrompt.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation.

Real-world datasets frequently suffer from censoring and missingness due to privacy concerns, while standard inference methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can become computationally intractable or fail to converge when data are sparse. To address these limitations, we propose a novel simulation-based Bayesian inference framework utilizing Neural Bayes Estimators (NBE) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPE). These neural methods are amortized: once trained, they provide instantaneous, computationally efficient posterior estimates, making them ideal for use in secure research environments where computational resources are limited. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that neural estimators achieve accuracy comparable to MCMC while being orders of magnitude faster and robust to the convergence failures that plague traditional samplers in sparse settings.

To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents.

We provide actionable guidance for researchers seeking to leverage this dataset in anomaly detection, protocol-misuse studies, threat intelligence, and defensive policy design. Descriptive statistics highlight significant skew: 2,438 unique source IPs span 95 countries, yet the top 1% of IPs account for 1% of all events, and three protocols dominate: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Telnet, Server Message Block (SMB). Temporal analysis uncovers pronounced rush-hour peaks at 07:00 and 23:00 UTC, interspersed with maintenance-induced gaps that reveal operational blind spots. Geospatial mapping further underscores platform-specific biases: SentryPeer captures concentrated SIP floods in North America and Southeast Asia, Cowrie logs Telnet/SSH scans predominantly from Western Europe and the U.S., and Dionaea records SMB exploits around European nodes.

In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes.

We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts.

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578bHyper - Enz\u9884\u6d4b\u9176 - \u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9176 - \u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u63d0\u51faHyper - Enz\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548cKGE\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8303\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9176\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe88%\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u9ad830%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9176 - \u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEquFL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEquFL\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u6536\u5230\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e2a\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u6574\u5408\u4ee5\u8c03\u6574\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cEquFL\u6536\u655b\u5230FedAvg\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "EquFL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions. A relevance scoring algorithm matched these profiles with unseen reviews based on sentiment and aspect similarity. Top-matched reviews were then summarized to reflect individual interests.

To address such an explanation question about a ranking function, we investigate the computation of SHAP scores for column weights, adopting a recent framework by Grohe et al.[ICDT'24]. The exact definition of this score depends on three key components: (1) the ranking function in use, (2) an effect function that quantifies the impact of using alternative weights on the ranking, and (3) an underlying weight distribution. We analyze the computational complexity of different instantiations of this framework for a range of fundamental ranking and effect functions, focusing on probabilistically independent finite distributions for individual columns.\n  For the ranking functions, we examine lexicographic orders and score-based orders defined by the summation, minimum, and maximum functions. For the effect functions, we consider global, top-k, and local perspectives: global measures quantify the divergence between the perturbed and original rankings, top-k measures inspect the change in the set of top-k answers, and local measures capture the impact on an individual tuple of interest. Although all cases admit an additive fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), we establish the complexity of exact computation, identifying which cases are solvable in polynomial time and which are #P-hard.

We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGlyRAG\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aT1D\u961f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u6536\u96c6\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0cLLM\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlyRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aT1D\u961f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cGlyRAG\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5RMSE\u6700\u591a\u4f4e39%\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u518d\u964d1.7%\uff1b85%\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u533a\uff0c\u5bf9\u8840\u7cd6\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6539\u558451%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods.

A game is said to be `connected' if it has a pure Nash equilibrium and the property that there is a best-response path from every action profile which is not a pure Nash equilibrium to every pure Nash equilibrium, and it is generic if it has no indifferences. In previous work we showed that, among all $n$-player $k$-action generic games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, the fraction that are connected tends to $1$ as $n$ gets sufficiently large relative to $k$. The present paper considers the large-$k$ regime, which behaves differently: we show that the connected fraction tends to $1-\u03b6_n$ as $k$ gets large, where $\u03b6_n>0$. In other words, a constant fraction of many-action games are not connected. However, $\u03b6_n$ is small and tends to $0$ rapidly with $n$, so as $n$ increases all but a vanishingly small fraction of many-player-many-action games are connected. Since connectedness is conducive to equilibrium convergence we obtain, by implication, that there is a simple adaptive dynamic that is guaranteed to lead to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a vanishingly small fraction of generic games that have one. Our results are based on new probabilistic and combinatorial arguments which allow us to address the large-$k$ regime that the approach used in our previous work could not tackle.

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents.

Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary.

A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search.

Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $\u0393$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets.

Preprint; work in progress", "summary": "Modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle with a fundamental architectural tension: vector indices are optimized for query latency but poorly handle continuous knowledge updates, while data lakes excel at versioning but introduce query latency penalties. We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices). The approach enables production RAG deployments requiring simultaneous optimization for query performance, update efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{new}}$.

A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks.

The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations.

Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery.

Existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks typically assume a static adjacency matrix. In this work, we propose an end-to-end dynamic edge-biased spatiotemporal model that ingests a multi-dimensional timeseries of node attributes and a timeseries of adjacency matrices, to predict multiple future steps of node attributes. At each time step, our transformer-based model injects the given adjacency as an adaptable attention bias, allowing the model to focus on relevant neighbors as the graph evolves. We further deploy a masked node-time pretraining objective that primes the encoder to reconstruct missing features, and train with scheduled sampling and a horizon-weighted loss to mitigate compounding error over long horizons. Unlike prior work, our model accommodates dynamic graphs that vary across input samples, enabling forecasting in multi-system settings such as brain networks across different subjects, financial systems in different contexts, or evolving social systems.

This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines.

This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5ffd\u89c6\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6309\u7b54\u6848\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9884\u671fF1\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5ffd\u89c6\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5e94\u6309\u771f\u5b9e\u7b54\u6848\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e80%\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections.

These representations are increasingly proxied by applying ML methods to high-dimensional, unstructured data, including product descriptions and images. When proxies fail to capture the true dimensions of differentiation that drive substitution, standard workflows will deliver biased counterfactuals and invalid inference. We develop a practical toolkit that corrects this bias and ensures valid inference for a broad class of counterfactuals. Our approach applies to market-level and/or individual data, requires minimal additional computation, is efficient, delivers simple formulas for standard errors, and accommodates data-dependent proxies, including embeddings from fine-tuned ML models.

Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency.

While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm.

Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders.

While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a \"transparency tax\" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price.

In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions.

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle.

However, existing e-commerce search architectures face a critical capability deficit in adapting to this change. Users are often caught in a dilemma: precise natural language descriptions frequently trigger zero-result scenarios, while the forced simplification of queries leads to decision overload from noisy, generic results. To tackle this challenge, we propose LEAPS (LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search), which seamlessly upgrades traditional search systems via a \"Broaden-and-Refine\" paradigm. Specifically, it attaches plugins to both ends of the search pipeline: (1) Upstream, a Query Expander acts as an intent translator. It employs a novel three-stage training strategy--inverse data augmentation, posterior-knowledge supervised fine-tuning, and diversity-aware reinforcement learning--to generate adaptive and complementary query combinations that maximize the candidate product set. (2) Downstream, a Relevance Verifier serves as a semantic gatekeeper. By synthesizing multi-source data (e.g., OCR text, reviews) and leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, it precisely filters noise to resolve selection overload. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that LEAPS significantly enhances conversational search experiences. Crucially, its non-invasive architecture preserves established retrieval performance optimized for short-text queries, while simultaneously allowing for low-cost integration into diverse back-ends.

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company.

Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data.

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation.

However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions.

Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting.

Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807TPC\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03OverSearchQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Tokens Per Correctness\uff08TPC\uff09\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u641c\u7d22\u901a\u5e38\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f03\u6743\uff1b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u7d22\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b\u8d1f\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f03\u6743\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03OverSearchQA\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets.

These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise.

While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u5206\u6b67\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6392\u540d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0eLLM\u800c\u975eTREC\u8bc4\u4f30\u5458\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7ecf\u5178\u6587\u672c\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0a\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u6b67\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6392\u540d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30TREC 2020\u548c2021\u64ad\u5ba2\u8f68\u9053\u4e2d\u7531TREC\u8bc4\u4f30\u5458\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2 - \u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u548cTREC\u8bc4\u4f30\u5458\u5206\u6b67\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0eLLM\u800c\u975eTREC\u8bc4\u4f30\u5458\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e862002\u5e74Sormunen\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5458\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting.

However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts.

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies.

A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment.

However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training.

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks.

Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens.

We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities.

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $\u03b5> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples.

However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks.

However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

However, existing research predominantly relies on reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks while overlooking supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods. This paper proposes a new two-stage training framework that enhances models' self-correction capabilities through self-generated long chain-of-thought (CoT) data. During the first stage, a multi-turn dialogue strategy guides the model to generate CoT data incorporating verification, backtracking, subgoal decomposition, and backward reasoning, with predefined rules filtering high-quality samples for supervised fine-tuning. The second stage employs a difficulty-aware rejection sampling mechanism to dynamically optimize data distribution, strengthening the model's ability to handle complex problems. The approach generates reasoning chains extended over 4 times longer while maintaining strong scalability, proving that SFT effectively activates models' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and provides a resource-efficient pathway for complex task optimization.

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6b63\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eETCL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u9f13\u52b1\u6b63\u5411\u524d\u540e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "ETCL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6b63\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions.

While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEvoC2Rust\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574C\u9879\u76ee\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548Rust\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c06C\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRust\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4e60\u60ef\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4e14\u90fd\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9aa8\u67b6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5206\u89e3C\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u6210Rust\u9aa8\u67b6\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u6362\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4fee\u590d\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad817.24%\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad814.32%\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u9ad843.59%\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoC2Rust\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u697c\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Wi-Fi\u6307\u7eb9\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u591a\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u6216\u697c\u5c42\u7ea7\u522b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636e\u6700\u5f3a\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u6307\u7eb9\u5206\u914d\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u7c07\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u7c07\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u697c\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76SAEs\u80fd\u5426\u8bc6\u522bLLMs\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5927\u591a\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u8054\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679ctoken\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9token\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u53ef\u88abtoken\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u672a\u88ab\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u7ecf\u8bc1\u4f2a\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684SAE\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u7684\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u672c\u8eab\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance.

We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) \u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76TRM\u5728ARC\u98ce\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7a76\u7adf\u6e90\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u8fd8\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9ARC Prize TRM\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u8c1c\u9898\u8eab\u4efd\u6d88\u878d\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0eLlama 3 8B\u7684QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff1b\u9012\u5f52\u6d45\u5c42\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u5927\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u76ca\uff1bTRM\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \\underline{F}lexible \\underline{L}ow-\\underline{R}ank \\underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC).

However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation.

Code and reproduction materials available on GitHub", "summary": "Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only.

Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory.

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\uff08DSTS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u773c\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u533a\u5206ASD\u548c\u5178\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2a\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\uff08DSTS\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDSTS\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DSTS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eASD\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds.

While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets.

We show that the answer is negative in a PCSG-inspired regime where overlapping coalitions generate highly coherent, near-duplicate columns: the irrepresentable condition fails for the design, and $k$-step Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) exhibits a nonvanishing probability of irreversible mis-selection. In contrast, we prove that Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) with a Gaussian-Gamma hierarchy is support consistent under the same structural assumptions.

Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration.

It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt.

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region.

However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries.

However, the computational cost of PSRO has become a significant limitation to its practical application. Our analysis shows that game simulation is the primary bottleneck in PSRO's runtime. To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response.

We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability.

On the defensive side, agentic capabilities enable continuous monitoring, autonomous incident response, adaptive threat hunting, and fraud detection at scale.

These dual-use dynamics expose fundamental gaps in existing governance, assurance, and accountability mechanisms, which were largely designed for non-autonomous and short-lived AI systems.

This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines.

Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length.

Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.\n  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\uff08BFD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3001\u673a\u5236\u6709\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u53caDINOv2\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728token\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\uff08BFD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eANOVA\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u5c06token\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u518d\u7528SVD\u5206\u6790\u67e5\u8be2 - \u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\uff08i\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0cContent - content\u4ea4\u4e92\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0cDINOv2\u5728\u5185\u5bb9 - \u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\uff08ii\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5934\u90e8\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5de5\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5947\u5f02\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e5f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002\uff08iii\uff09DINOv2\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "BFD\u63ed\u793a\u4e86token\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u4ecb\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis.

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions.

We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdPRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u7ecf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5408\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7ecf\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210Argonne MADSci\u534f\u8bae\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4eea\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u6216\u6d4b\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u3002"}}

We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions.

Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics.

We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS).

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations.

We introduce a hybrid framework that uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight transaction models, balancing interpretability with operational efficiency.

In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities.

While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage.

Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency.

The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution.

Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently.

However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles.

Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings.

Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility.

However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area.

Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as \"Reasoning + X\", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification.

However, the practical effectiveness of existing attacks is undermined by several critical limitations: they struggle to maintain a coherent progression over long interactions, often losing track of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done; they rely on rigid or pre-defined patterns, and fail to adapt to the LLM's dynamic and unpredictable conversational state. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings.

Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid \"ground truth\" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u4e3b\u626b\u63cf\u63a2\u9488\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6846\u67b6\u63a2\u7d22\u7ec4\u5408\u6750\u6599\u5e93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784 - \u5c5e\u6027\u8d8b\u52bf\u56fe\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec4\u5408\u6750\u6599\u5e93\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u8868\u5f81\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ca\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784 - \u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u548c\u78c1\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u626b\u63cf\u63a2\u9488\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u95ed\u73af\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Overlapping k-mer tokenization can introduce information leakage under masked language modeling (MLM) and may degrade downstream accuracy. Single-nucleotide tokenization avoids leakage and preserves per-base fidelity, but it greatly increases sequence length for attention-based architectures. Non-overlapping k-mers and byte-pair encoding (BPE) provide compression and avoid leakage, at the cost of boundary sensitivity or reduced interpretability. Empirically, the choice of tokenization interacts strongly with model architecture and task requirements. At the system level, however, standard string tokenizers and host-bound vocabulary lookups dominate wall-clock time once inputs reach billions of bases, regardless of the tokenization algorithm. We present DNATok, a high-performance, GPU-first tokenization system that replaces general-purpose string processing with byte lookup table (LUT)-based identifier streaming and an overlapped host-to-device (H2D)/compute pipeline using pinned memory and architectural parallelism. DNATok is vocabulary-agnostic: it accelerates single-nucleotide, non-overlapping k-mer, and BPE tokenization, and integrates as a drop-in systems layer beneath genomic foundation models. DNATok achieves 84-95x higher encoding throughput than optimized Hugging Face baselines and up to 1.9x higher H2D throughput. End-to-end streaming reaches 1.27-1.84e8 tokens/s depending on configuration, effectively removing tokenization as a bottleneck for production-scale training and inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001GPU\u4f18\u5148\u7684DNA\u5206\u8bcd\u7cfb\u7edfDNATok\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u548cH2D\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDNA\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u8bcd\u6c47\u67e5\u627e\u8017\u65f6\u4e45\u3002", "method": "DNATok\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u8282\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6d41\u66ff\u4ee3\u901a\u7528\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u4e3b\u673a\u5230\u8bbe\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "DNATok\u7f16\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u7684Hugging Face\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad884 - 95\u500d\uff0cH2D\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe1.9\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u8fbe1.27 - 1.84e8\u4ee4\u724c/\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "DNATok\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u5c06\u8bf4\u670d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8fc7\u5f80\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800c\u8003\u8651\u8bf4\u670d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5f88\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728ChangeMyView Reddit\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad813.77%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen.

Determining whether courses at different institutions are equivalent (i.e., articulation) is essential for successful credit transfer, as it minimizes unused credits and increases the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion. However, establishing articulation agreements remains time- and resource-intensive, as all candidate articulations are reviewed manually. Although recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence to support this work, its use in articulation practice remains limited. Given these challenges and the need for scalable support, this study applies artificial intelligence to suggest articulations between institutions in collaboration with the State University of New York system, one of the largest systems of higher education in the US. To develop our methodology, we first surveyed articulation staff and faculty to assess adoption rates of baseline algorithmic recommendations and gather feedback on perceptions and concerns about these recommendations. Building on these insights, we developed a supervised alignment method that addresses superficial matching and institutional biases in catalog descriptions, achieving a 5.5-fold improvement in accuracy over previous methods. Based on articulation predictions of this method and a 61% average surveyed adoption rate among faculty and staff, these findings project a 12-fold increase in valid credit mobility opportunities that would otherwise remain unrealized.

This scaling is particularly detrimental in low-data regimes, as the final projection layer would require many parameters, leading to severe overfitting and intractability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u8fd1\u5e74\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u5143\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u591a\u5143\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca", "result": "\u5728naive\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ef4\u6709N\u4e2a\u4ed3\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u7f51\u683c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels.

This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data.

Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings.

In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u63a8\u52a8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f16\u8f91\u53ef\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e5d\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5f52\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u6291\u5236BERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u504f\u89c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications.

This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SAFE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u8fbe\u6210\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAFE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u672c\u5730\u6279\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5b58\u50a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSAFE\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e14\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAFE\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u3002"}}

To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network.

From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories.

To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian.

Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain.

We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift.

Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers.

Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%.

To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains.

However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands.

Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks.

In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods.

Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts.

In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger.

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.
