In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a\ntraining-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:\ndynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating\nthe GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual\nelements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality\nindependently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions\nare ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by\ngenerating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions\nand incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This\nhierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts\nwithout the need for additional training or annotations.

These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent\ndocumentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for\naccurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table\nextraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor\nperformance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This\npaper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be\nextracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,\ncausing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a\nnovel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically\nenriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text\nlinearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve\nboth structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental\nevaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates\nTalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering\ntasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS\nTextract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that\nthe Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management\napplications.

To address the\nsubstantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs\nlow-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This\napproach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an\nadvanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value\nDecomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has\nnever been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance\nresolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate\nsignificant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR\ntechniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance,\nin a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can\nachieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a\nlow Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the\nhigh-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of\nthe EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on\nlimited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the\npotential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications,\nparticularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields.\nIts ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes\nit suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental\nmonitoring or aerospace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\uff08DA\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\uff08ROM\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u2018\u771f\u5b9e\u2019\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u964d\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08EnKF\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08lcSVD\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u6e4d\u6d41\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u738715.9\u65f6\u53ef\u52a0\u901f13.7\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u7f2990.9%\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u81f32.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, most of them\noperate under a limited assumption: a static query environment. This limitation\nprevents them from effectively handling complex, dynamic query environments in\nreal-world scenarios. Extensive retraining can lead to the well-known\ncatastrophic forgetting problem, which reduces the LQO generalizability over\ntime. In this paper, we address this limitation and introduce LIMAO (Lifelong\nModular Learned Query Optimizer), a framework for lifelong learning of plan\ncost prediction that can be seamlessly integrated into existing LQOs. LIMAO\nleverages a modular lifelong learning technique, an attention-based neural\nnetwork composition architecture, and an efficient training paradigm designed\nto retain prior knowledge while continuously adapting to new environments. We\nimplement LIMAO in two LQOs, showing that our approach is agnostic to\nunderlying engines.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nnon-constant inapproximability result known for this problem. We also\nstrengthen the known \\np-hardness of the problem on $2$-apex graphs by showing\nthat the same result holds for $1$-apex graphs. This leaves open the problem of\ndetermining whether the problem remains \\np-hard on planar (i.e., $0$-apex)\ngraphs.\n  On the positive side, we design an algorithm that computes good approximate\nsolutions for hereditary graph classes that admit efficiently computable\nbalanced separators of truly sublinear size.

Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that\nLLM-Meshimproves service capacity by 44% - 63% through sharing, while further\nleveraging CPUs boosts this to 91% - 159%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848LLM - Mesh\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u5f39\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5174\u8d77\u5e26\u6765\u79c1\u6709\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u5c5eGPU\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u5e26\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7684CPU\u67b6\u6784\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e14CPU\u548cGPU\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5bb9\u7eb3\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM - Mesh\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u4e14\u6709\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u62a2\u5360\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u88c5\u7bb1\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a32\u6838CPU\u548c4\u4e2aA100 GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLLM - Mesh\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4f7f\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u534744% - 63%\uff0c\u5229\u7528CPU\u53ef\u5c06\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u523091% - 159%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM - Mesh\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002"}}

However,\nwe find approximately 70% of the names recommended by these IDEs are different\nfrom what developers manually constructed, adding additional renaming burdens\nto developers and providing limited assistance. In this paper, we introduce\nVarNamer, an automated approach designed to recommend variable names for\nextract local variable refactorings. Through a large-scale empirical study, we\nidentify key contexts that are useful for composing variable names. Leveraging\nthese insights, we developed a set of heuristic rules through program static\nanalysis techniques and employ data mining techniques to recommend variable\nnames effectively.

Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely\nreplicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This\npaper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision\nlogic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify\ncritical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes\nin the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the\noutput changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are\nthen trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate\nthe system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the\npipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,\nincluding threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.\nResults show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant\nboundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of\nthe underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating\nspecifications and test cases during legacy migration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u65b0\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528RL\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u865a\u62df\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f5c\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5e76\u7528K-Means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6210\u529f\u805a\u7126\u76f8\u5173\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u865a\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\u6838\u5fc3\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u4e3a\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

It proposes an\noptimization method for elastic cloud resource scaling based on a multi-agent\nsystem. The method deploys multiple autonomous agents to perceive resource\nstates in parallel and make local decisions. While maintaining the distributed\nnature of the system, it introduces a collaborative value function to achieve\nglobal coordination. This improves the responsiveness of resource scheduling\nand enhances overall system performance. To strengthen system foresight, a\nlightweight state prediction model is designed. It assists agents in\nidentifying future workload trends and optimizes the selection of scaling\nactions. For policy training, the method adopts a centralized training and\ndecentralized execution reinforcement learning framework. This enables agents\nto learn effectively and coordinate strategies under conditions of incomplete\ninformation. The paper also constructs typical cloud scenarios, including\nmulti-tenancy and burst traffic, to evaluate the proposed method. The\nevaluation focuses on resource isolation, service quality assurance, and\nrobustness. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent scaling\nstrategy outperforms existing methods in resource utilization, SLA violation\ncontrol, and scheduling latency.

Although similar capabilities have been explored for\nrelational databases, their implementation for graph databases presents unique\nchallenges. This is mainly attributed to the relatively large complexity of\nqueries in graph databases. When translating graph queries into arithmetic\ncircuits, the circuit scale can be too large to be practically evaluated. To\naddress this issue, we propose to break down graph queries into more\nfine-grained, primitive operators, enabling a step-by-step evaluation through\nsmaller-scale circuits. Accordingly, the verification with ZKP circuits of\ncomplex graph queries can be decomposed into a series of composable\ncryptographic primitives, each designed to verify a fundamental structural\nproperty such as path ordering or edge directionality. Especially, having\nnoticed that the graph expansion (i.e., traversing from nodes to their\nneighbors along edges) operation serves as the backbone of graph query\nevaluation, we design the expansion centric operator decomposition. In addition\nto constructing circuits for the expansion primitives, we also design\nspecialized ZKP circuits for the various attributes that augment this\ntraversal. The circuits are meticulously designed to take advantage of PLONKish\narithmetization. By integrating these optimized circuits, we implement ZKGraph,\na system that provides verifiable query processing while preserving data\nprivacy.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations.

However, it has\nbeen observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is\nsusceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this\nissue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation\nclassification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new\nconcept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial\nattacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an\nAdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an\nadversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we\ncombine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural\nnetwork model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to\ndetecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into\nthe operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.\nWe show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,\ninfluencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in\nthe input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous.

However, these data are often too fine-grained to derive useful\ninsights into the execution of the larger processes an IoT system might be part\nof. Process mining has developed advanced approaches for the analysis of\nbusiness processes that may also be used in the context of IoT. Bringing\nprocess mining to IoT requires an event abstraction step to lift the low-level\nsensor data to the business process level. In this work, we aim to empower\ndomain experts to perform this step using a newly developed domain-specific\nlanguage (DSL) called Radiant. Radiant supports the specification of patterns\nwithin the sensor data that indicate the execution of higher level process\nactivities. These patterns are translated to complex event processing (CEP)\napplications to be used for detecting activity executions at runtime.

Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a\nscalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with\nhyperspherical embeddings.

While several studies highlight productivity\nimprovements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.\n[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants\naffects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can\nevolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled\nexperiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional\ndevelopers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web\napplication, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled\ntrial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.\n[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in\nsubsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither\ndifference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was\nstatistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase\n1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous\nproductivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in\ntask completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was\n55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants\ncan effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning\nsigns of degraded code-level maintainability.

Equal contribution by Kiyoung Om,\n  Kyuil Sim, and Taeyoung Yun", "summary": "Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints\nis a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.\nThese problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to\nhard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.\nFirst, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and\nsurrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations\nwith uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance\non various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.\nOur code is publicly available \\href{https://github.com/umkiyoung/CiBO}{here}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5206\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u518d\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed\nto potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the\noriginal behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger\ncertain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing\nunauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new\nchallenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent\nagents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in\ndetecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations\nor sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated\nmethodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is\ncurrently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile\nmultimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by\nincorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated\nassisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary\nvalidation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the\nmethod can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist\nin reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study\ncan provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and\nprotection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u79fb\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u98ce\u9669\u5224\u522b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8a\u72f1\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8d8a\u72f1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u98ce\u9669\u5224\u522b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u88ab\u8d8a\u72f1\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u671b\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to\nthe modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability.

This\nstudy addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs\n-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the\nbalanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly\ncaptures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal\nregression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit\nmodel from econometrics to neural networks.

Arguably, effective safety\nevaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover\na broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose\npotential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on\nhandcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the\nintensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with\nrapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation\noffers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation.

However, accurately\nforecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due\nto the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of\niceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg\nmotion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a\nhighly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These\nlimitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture\nthe underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep\nlearning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift\nphysics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the\npattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth\nobservations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network\nthat captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future\niceberg drift positions.

However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still\nrequire frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication\noverhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,\na communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware\ninference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in\ncollaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when\nLLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned\nthresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a\nprivacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages\nembedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,\nenabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without\nengaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge\nservers refine local routing policies through client updates, while\ncross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries.

This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer\nsome mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical\ndata for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains.

This\nreliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and\nlimited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches\nlack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design\ncontributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To\naddress these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed\nhuman failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven\nby AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the\ninterface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated\ngraph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables\nautomated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated\noperational paths.

Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral\nand political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based\nsocial decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected\nwhen the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary\ngame-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where\nthe extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of\nLLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating\ncooperation against good opponents.

Inspired by the remarkable performance of\ndiffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their\npotential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.\nTherefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the\nperspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively\nrefining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model\nto learn how label information is generated stochastically.

While diffusion models have proven highly\neffective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world\napplications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring\noptimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions\nsuch as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.\nAlthough RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such\nobjectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode\ncollapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative\ndistillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to\noptimize for arbitrary reward functions.

However, PbRL can\nsuffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward\nmodel. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and\nfine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,\nusing different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose\nchallenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to\neffectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM).

The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method\nachieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior\nrewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a\nnegated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka\nPanda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot.

In this\nwork, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts\nis decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a\ngreat deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,\nacross models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country\ncan be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.\nSurprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)\nsometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of\nrevealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the\ninternal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs\nthrough instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not\nmerely \"leftover\" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we\nfind that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise\ncomparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with\nsuppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other\ndownstream tasks.

We integrate\nthe Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and\ninstitutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in\nresponse to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national\nboundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global\nsocio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by\ngovernance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate\ncompliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.\nDrawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent\nproperty of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies\nincluding internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network\nengagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption\nin the accounting domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u8de8\u56fd\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecb\u5165\u51b3\u7b56\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u95ee\u8d23\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u8de8\u56fd\u538b\u529b\u91c7\u7528AI\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6269\u5c55TAM\uff0c\u501f\u9274ANT\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u5728\u5168\u7403\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5171\u540c\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u90e8\u6cbb\u7406\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f1a\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u5408\u6cd5\u4e14\u5168\u7403\u8ba4\u53ef\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, the high resolution\nand large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying\nDeep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller\npatches with a global label (\\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a\n(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution\nfor WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high\nvariability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15\nAUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL\nmethods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight\ninitialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To\naddress that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL\nmethods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most\nstable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be\napplied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also\nsimplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

In this dissertation, we focus on\nlanguages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in\nthis region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of\nlabelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse\nthe noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,\ndemonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word\nembeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of\npre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word\nembeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model\n(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and\nlow-resource scenarios.

We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers\nthat adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent\ndirections that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable\nthe optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show\nthat this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after\nsufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's\ninvariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in\nthe enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while\nthe original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these\nresults provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates\nearly stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u52a0\u901fDNN\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u533a\u5206\u6536\u655b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7d\u7075\u7c7b\u522b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u904d\u5386\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u52a0\u901fDNN\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5927Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u8fd0\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5e7d\u7075\u7c7b\u522b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u5e7d\u7075\u8f93\u51fa\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5e7d\u7075\u7c7b\u522b\u6269\u5c55\u4e25\u683c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u540e\u5e7d\u7075\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u603b\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u589e\u4e14\u539f\u635f\u5931\u4efb\u610f\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Yet subsurface analysis remains\nfragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,\nstratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each\ntightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We\nintroduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative\narchitecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference\nalong latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This\nformulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference\nmechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,\nmasks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce\ngeologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot\ngeneralization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining\nfor new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage\ntraining process that combines self-supervised representation learning on\nlarge-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts\nand labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad\napplicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy\nanalysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic\nstratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By\nbridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware\nmanner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical\nAI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,\npromptable reasoning system.

In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device.

Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios.

Data pruning\noffers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing\nmethods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while\nmodel-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally\nprohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid\nframework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with\nmodel-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions\ndata and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy\nmodel to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by\ncomparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal\nadaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more\naggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in\ninformative ones.

Experimental results show that our\nad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing\nstrategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection\nperformance.

Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene\ndescriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs\ncan respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a\nbox-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs\non spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express\nintent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for\nfocused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical\nevaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess\nbasic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for\nbox-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)\nspatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To\nsupport this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual\nattributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object\ntrajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs.

MoR eliminates the need\nfor task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust\nreasoning across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMoR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u601d\u60f3\u751f\u6210\u548cSFT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "MoR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMoR150\u5728CoT\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u63d0\u53472.2%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534713.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "MoR\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals.

Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D\nconvolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with\n1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143\nheld-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms).

A DL model was\ntrained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower\nquartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the\nmyocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.\nDice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated\nsegmentation performance.

With powerful semantic\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent\nagents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this\narticle, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are\nsemi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used\nfor system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of\nurban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we\nsurvey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,\nencompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and\nlearning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into\nfive groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and\nurban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we\ndiscuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world\ndeployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey\naims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and\nto provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban\nintelligence.

However, prior research has\ndemonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the\ntraining set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding\nself-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for\nsingle-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid\nMamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance\nhave been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech\nenhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended\n(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging\nnoise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our\nproposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar\ncomplexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020\nand EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset\nVB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the\ntime- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization\nperformance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a\nnotable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets.

In particular, collecting such extensive data\nintraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses\nthis challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative\ndata to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.\n  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera\nviewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.\nIntraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the\npre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically\ncombining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables\nthe creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.\n  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.\nQuantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope\nimages demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics\nindicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment.
