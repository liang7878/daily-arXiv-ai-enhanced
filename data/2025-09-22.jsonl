While many prior works have studied the incentive\nstructures of LPs in general, we currently lack a principled understanding of a\nspecial class of LPs known as Just-In-Time (JIT) LPs. These are strategic\nagents who momentarily supply liquidity for a single swap, in an attempt to\nextract disproportionately high fees relative to the remaining passive LPs.\nThis paper provides the first formal, transaction-level model of JIT liquidity\nprovision for a widespread class of AMMs known as Concentrated Liquidity Market\nMakers (CLMMs), as seen in Uniswap V3, for instance. We characterize the\nlandscape of price impact and fee allocation in these systems, formulate and\nanalyze a non-linear optimization problem faced by JIT LPs, and prove the\nexistence of an optimal strategy. By fitting our optimal solution for JIT LPs\nto real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools (particularly those\nwith risky assets), there is a significant gap between observed and optimal JIT\nbehavior. Existing JIT LPs often fail to account for price impact; doing so, we\nestimate they could increase earnings by up to 69% on average over small time\nwindows.

While popular\nbenchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated\ncode, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs\nprovide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its\nfunctional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on\nreporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness,\nthe causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this\nwork, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs,\nrevealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code\nfunctionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these\nCEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally\ndissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this\ngap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117\ncode pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a\nfunctional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to\nperform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through\ndifferential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and,\nat the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order\nof magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show\nsignificant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines.\nFinally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to\nLoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to\nsurface bias."}

This means that\nthe flexibility effect of half of the BEV fleet charging bidirectionally\noutweighs the demand effect of the whole BEV fleet. We show how costs savings\nare driven by the ability of V2G to serve demand, especially during hours with\nhigh residual load. We also explore the distributional effects of respective\nelectricity price changes. While V2G car owners internalize a substantial share\nof overall cost savings, the benefits increasingly spill over to other\nelectricity consumers as the share of bidirectional charging grows. We conclude\nthat policymakers should focus on enabling a moderate fleet share of V2G rather\nthan on enabling every car to charge smartly."}

To mitigate these problems and seek more\nstructured and efficient alternatives, this study proposes a method that\ndivides documents into chunk units and generates textual data for each chunk to\nsimultaneously improve retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Yet, even when restricted to deterministic transports, such\ncouplings are not identifiable: two atomless marginals admit infinitely many\ntransport maps. The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost\nminimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct\nnotions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first\ncarry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps:\ncyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps.

In parallel, we formulate\ncounterfactual reasoning within the framework of structural causal models as a\nproblem of selecting transport maps between fixed marginals, which makes\nexplicit the role of untestable assumptions in counterfactual reasoning. Then,\nwe are able to connect these two perspectives by identifying conditions on\ncausal graphs and structural equations under which counterfactual maps coincide\nwith classical statistical transports. In this way, we delineate the\ncircumstances in which causal assumptions support the use of a specific\nstructure of transport map.

Extensive evaluations on both\nreasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in\nend-to-end training throughput."}

Traditional keyword-based search methodologies\nfalter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact\ntextual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product\ndeduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach\nemploys a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in\nconjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these\narchitectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce\ncompact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss.\nComplementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both\ntext and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with\nMilvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and\nhigh-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding\n200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption.

FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular\nfragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets\nof fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first\nformal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree\nsearch exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as\n$O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number\nof heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree\nsearch.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.

We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model\n(LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of\ntranslations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides\nequivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent\nsemantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent\nto write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent\nattempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made\nby the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results.\n  We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four\nrepository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs\nfrom their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub\nprojects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that\nMatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs,\nwith the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them.\nWhen MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of\nthe time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that\nMatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior\nwork's 18.5%.

We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.

However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to\nefficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks.

We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks.

We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

Second, we consider the use of foundation agents\n(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making.

Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects.

We propose the\nautomation of this task by casting the analysis procedure as a Markov decision\nprocess and solving it by graph reinforcement learning using reward functions\nlearned on historical human decisions. In our evaluations on existing spectral\nline lists and theoretical calculations for Co II and Nd II-III, hundreds of\nlevel energies were computed within hours, agreeing with published values in\n95% of cases for Co II and 54-87% for Nd II-III. As the current efficiency in\natomic fine structure determination struggles to meet growing atomic data\ndemands from astronomy and fusion science, our new artificial intelligence\napproach sets the stage for closing this gap."}

The QGAA consists of\ntwo components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and\n(b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of\nthe trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities.\nThe utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a)\ngeneration of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized\nmolecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies\nestimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in\nsimulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for\nquantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine\nlearning applications."}

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if\nnecessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated\nvalidation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high\nengineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test\nsuites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective\ntranslation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model\n(LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of\ntranslations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides\nequivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent\nsemantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent\nto write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent\nattempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made\nby the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results.\n  We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four\nrepository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs\nfrom their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub\nprojects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that\nMatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs,\nwith the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them.\nWhen MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of\nthe time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that\nMatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior\nwork's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to\nmany PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation\nresults."}

However, existing open-source\nmodels often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We\npresent Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially\nreduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated\ntraining recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters\nthat produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete\ntokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified\nautoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image\ntokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image\ntokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe\nover understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both\ncapabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,\nand is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich\nevaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer."}
