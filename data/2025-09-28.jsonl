The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time.

To address these limitations, we\npropose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating\nLLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key\ncomponents: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM\nRe-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM\nFunctionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language\ndescription that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense\nRetrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed\nboth the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods\n(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with\nsimilar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the\nretrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the\nwidely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art\nLLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by\n19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively.

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the\nonline mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously\nexploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and\nenhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models\nnot only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing\nschedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria\nare introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time\ntraining, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,\nthus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical\nenvironments."}

Our results demonstrate that\nNTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and\nsimple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.\nFurthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding\nonly the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection\nperformance.

Recently, Telegram has gained prominence\nas a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related\ninformation that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that\nsystematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The\npipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages\nfrom 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter\nthreat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based\nclassifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we\ncompile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including\ndomains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs.

The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time.

To resolve these biases, we propose 2\ninference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness\nIntervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness\nAgents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)\nintroduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.\n(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized\nagents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates\ninitial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates\nfeedback to produce a polished, unbiased script).

This is especially relevant for manifold learning\nmethods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative\nspatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable\nAssociations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local\nembedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To\nachieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities\n(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original\nfeatures, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the\nentire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney\ndataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with\nvisually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly\ndistant regions of the latent spaces."}

Existing\nschemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication\noverhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness\nhinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples\nexhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level\nPP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur\nhardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP\ngranularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence\nlength distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a\nchallenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP\nscheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism\n(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource\nand workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system\nthat unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and\nworkload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short\nones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline\nschedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware\nchunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nInfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems."}

This\npaper introduces the \\ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent\nrepresentations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their\ntemporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by\nextending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to\nthe hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive\nbiases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose\nthree novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both\ntaxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive\napproaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on\ngenerating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that\nthe proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal\ndynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories."}
