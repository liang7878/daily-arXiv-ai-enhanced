Its\nacquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both\ndescriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that\nidentify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical\ncomputational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,\nposit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation\n(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an\nalternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is\nthat these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.\nHere, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state\nrepresentation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive\naspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction\nsequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a\nconstruct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of\ngoal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious\naccount of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence\nbetween behavioral policies and desirable experience features.

We observe that human navigation\nand movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental\ninteractions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework\nproduces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours\narising naturally from any environmental setting."}

The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination\nregarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for\nthe target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and\ninterpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence\n(prediction $\\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as\nequalized odds; prediction $\\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on\ntarget attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned\non the prediction $\\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)\nand biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both\nindependence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive\naccuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,\nthereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among\nthese fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,\n$\\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,\nwith linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for\n$\\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,\nwhich serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus\nis on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for\nprincipled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies."}

In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness\nare known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,\nthe stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to\nimproving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby\nrelaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to\nrelaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that\nstudents may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without\nsuch envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who\nare not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are\nacquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,\nrepresented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy\ntoward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property\nthat there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local\nenvy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved\nwhile maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph\nstructure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that\ncan achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the\nrelaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which\nparameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then\nclarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by\nPareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and\nsingle-peaked preferences on the graphs."}

The state-of-the-art\nalgorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals\nby exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time\nintervals.

To address this, we propose a personalized lung\ncancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate\nmodel for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern\nretrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured\nmetadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the\nagent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search\nacross nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient\npopulation from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model\n(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance\nmetrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight\nrepresentative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,\nBrock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer\nvision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent\npipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,\ncohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile.

However, their\nsubstantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where\nfrequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the\ndominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\\% of query latency. Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements.

Second, behavior-aware\nfine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation\nobjectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal\nreconstruction loss.

Although several methods have been proposed\nto automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of\ninsufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,\nwe propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI\nconsists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug\nidentification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code\nwith no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and\ncoverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants\nof seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It\nuses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog\ndesigns, making the generated variants have complex control flows and\nstructures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,\ncompares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.\nExperiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced.

To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs.

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\nhave been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations\ninto sparse, more interpretable features.

This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained\nconcept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures\nhow distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,\ngreater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often\nimpairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more\nprecise concept-level control when using partial suppression.

SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic\nunsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external\nclassifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content\ntracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful\nknowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without\ndegrading overall model quality.

While the Cumulative Spectral\nGradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes\nwithin a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier\nagnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and\ncorrelating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG\nsettings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of\nmulti relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via\ntransformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is\nhighly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number\nof classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with\nstandard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To\ndeepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and\nsemantic KG complexity metrics.

Third,\nto address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier\nfeature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple\nmappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,\nwe introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the\nterminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint\nfor the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we\npropose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which\npreserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger\npenalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively\nchallenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the\ntransonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,\nhigh-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of\nspatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent\nKolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive\naccuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's\nrobustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific\ncomputing."}

ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We\nevaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.\nExperimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene\nchanges. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub."}

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results\nsuggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly\nleveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI\nin medical imaging."}

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis\nacross cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to\nwhich agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects\nbetween policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent\nbehaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic\ndecisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our\nperturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success\nrate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger\nmanipulation."}
