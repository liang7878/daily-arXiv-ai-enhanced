This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an\nunderstanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems\npreserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn\nconversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents\nprimarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information\ncan be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158\nreal-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed\nsuch that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet\nunrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then\nevaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of\ncontextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without\nviolating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,\nincluding GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual\nprivacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\\% and 43.6\\% of the\ntime. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in\n59.9\\% and 50.5\\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.\nFurthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\\% of scenarios.\nThese results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both\ncontextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAGPIE\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u9886\u57df158\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684MAGPIE\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "GPT - 4o\u548cClaude - 2.7 - Sonnet\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u79c1\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bef\u5224\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5171\u4eab\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a25.2%\u548c43.6%\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u660e\u786e\u9690\u79c1\u6307\u4ee4\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf71%\u7684\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u9762\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms.

An automated feature engineering pipeline\nextracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent\nmodel input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key\nfinding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training\nrewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics\nsuch as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core\nchallenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,\nthe mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our\nanalysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to\nshort-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue\nis compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of\nquantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints.

Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive\nliterature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase\nunwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth\nobservation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like\nNISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing\nbecomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their\nevent-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x\ncompared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy.

A key challenge arises from the latent nature of broader economy-wide\nrisk sources: macro-financial proxies are unavailable at high-frequencies,\nwhile the abundance of low-frequency candidates offers limited guidance on\nempirical relevance. To address this, we develop a two-stage\n``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to\nhigh-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV\nregressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by\nextracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping\nit to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based\nindicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of\nheterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across\nasset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets,\ncovering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term\nmean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility\nand illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to\nmarket-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi\ncounterparts.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans.

Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning.

We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes.

Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates\nlow-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.\nImportantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer\ndata points and less computational power than artificial models require. We\nintroduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural\nactivity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model\nfor training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)\nBrain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations\nthrough a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects\nlatent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via\nsupervised regression of brain-derived features.

Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the\nnull value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller\nafterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy.\nFurthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption)\nbecomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk.

On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and\n(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable\nminima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness\ndoes imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily\ndeteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an\nexponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\\`a-vis low-norm\nsolutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a\nnovel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat\nsolutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely\nactivate, but with high weight magnitudes.

In\nreal-world applications, the candidate document set is on the order of\nmillions, making a single-stage ranking policy impractical. In order to scale\nto millions of documents, real-world ranking systems are designed in a\ntwo-stage fashion, with a candidate generator followed by a ranker.

Emerging\nMixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,\ngreatly reducing data movement.

We detail how this approach navigates the\nchallenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to\ncompensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.\n  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were\nembargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,\noperational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of\nLLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,\nespecially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u201cGPU\u5185\u6838\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u201d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u867d\u65e0\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316GPU\u5185\u6838\u6027\u80fd\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u6216\u6587\u6863\u8f83\u5c11\u7684GPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u4f20\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u6bb5\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u8fdb\u5316\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7248\u672c\u3001\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u56e0\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5904\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u671f\u672a\u516c\u5e03\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f7fGPU\u5185\u6838\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u666e\u53ca\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial\nand error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs.

Our result can be seen as a Lipschitz\ncontinuous analogue of Courcelle's theorem, which offers Lipschitz continuous\nalgorithms for problems on bounded-treewidth graphs. Specifically, we consider\nthe problem of finding a vertex set in a graph that maximizes or minimizes the\ntotal weight, subject to constraints expressed in monadic second-order logic\n(MSO_2). We show that for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $(1\\pm\n\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with a polylogarithmic\nLipschitz constant on bounded treewidth graphs.

While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic\ndata generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of\ngenerated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,\nan enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data\nthat extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and\ncuration techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how\nprompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation\ncuration affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect\ndetection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security\nvs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting\nsignificantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,\nwith F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic\nEditing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,\ngreatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing\nperformance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves\ndiversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some\nredundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that\nsynthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific\ntasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and\ndefect classification (+15.4 points).

In many real-world instances,\non the other hand, the minimum number of cliques in an edge cover or partition\ncan be very close to the size of a maximum independent set \\alpha(G).\n  Motivated by this observation, we investigate above \\alpha parameterizations\nof the edge clique cover and partition problems. Concretely, we introduce and\nstudy Edge Clique Cover Above Independent Set (ECC/\\alpha) and Edge Clique\nPartition Above Independent Set (ECP/\\alpha), where the goal is to cover or\npartition all edges of a graph using at most \\alpha(G) + k cliques, and k is\nthe parameter.

Under relatively mild conditions\nallowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on\nits performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise\nscale $\\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical\nanalysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how\nthe residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild\nsub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the\nblock-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to\nvarious problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with\nstructured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural\nnetwork priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u62df\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5747\u65b9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u4e3e\u4f8b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5747\u65b9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b8b\u5dee\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u4fee\u6b63\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u91cd\u62df\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Rademacher\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bf9\u79f0\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5408\u9002\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u62df\u5408\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web\n2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that\nrequire real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed\nwith over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating\ntime-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge\nframework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a\ntree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness\nand source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier\nagentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error\nanalysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,\nOpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while\nspending half the time, showing a great potential.

To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly\nsupport lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)\nformats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a\nshared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and\nperform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency\ngains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of\nblock-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one\nthousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from\n$2 \\times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \\times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad\nrange of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe\nthat training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the\nloss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we\nconduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that\nexhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural\nsettings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a\nsimple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the\nquantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of\nactivations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \\emph{in situ} intervention\nexperiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be\naverted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these\nfindings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that\ncertain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with\nfull-precision training.

When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP\nare used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text\nversus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores\nthem to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and\nleverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For\nevaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20\ndifferent reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP\nscore, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare\ninstance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple\nFAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an\n81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets\nindeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an\nappropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality\nwin rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON\nexhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for\nimproving human-perceived quality.

Linear parameter\ndecomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues\nwith current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into\na sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main\nmethod in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is\nimpractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to\nhyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Stochastic Parameter\nDecomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to\nhyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are\nslightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD.

In the dispersive variant of the\nArt Gallery Problem, the objective is not to minimize the number of guards but\nto maximize the minimum geodesic $L_1$-distance between any two guards, called\nthe dispersion distance.\n  Our main contributions are as follows. We prove that determining whether a\nvertex guard set can achieve a dispersion distance of $4$ in office-like\npolygons is NP-complete, where vertices of the polygon are restricted to\ninteger coordinates. Additionally, we present a simple worst-case optimal\nalgorithm that guarantees a dispersion distance of $3$ in polynomial time. Our\ncomplexity result extends to polyominoes, resolving an open question posed by\nRieck and Scheffer (CGTA 2024). When vertex coordinates are allowed to be\nrational, we establish analogous results, proving that achieving a dispersion\ndistance of $2+\\varepsilon$ is NP-hard for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, while the\nclassic Art Gallery Problem remains solvable in polynomial time for this class\nof polygons. Furthermore, we give a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm\nthat computes worst-case optimal solutions with a dispersion distance of $2$.\n  On the other hand, for the more restricted class of hole-free independent\noffice-like polygons, we propose a dynamic programming approach that computes\noptimal solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the problem is practically\ntractable for arbitrary orthogonal polygons. To this end, we compare solvers\nbased on SAT, CP, and MIP formulations.

While FPGAs offer a promising\nplatform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target\nfeed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom\nimplementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the\nopen-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment\nof LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open\nNeural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of\nLSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and\nfunctional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom\ntransformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation\ngraph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and\nVitis HLS.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

This design enables lightweight\nTransformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,\nmaking them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional\nshallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep\nTransformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency.

Automated accurate delineation of\ncardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and\nautomated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep\nlearning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution\ntransformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and\nspatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an\naccurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance\n(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships\nusing a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and\nspatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep\nembedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies\nimportant features and their spatial localization. The combined edge\ninformation with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces\ninformation-loss during convolution transformations.

In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,\nthese set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse\nsupervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize\none-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity\nwithin the set.

However,\nlittle research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.\nTo address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)\nframework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like\nidentity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human\nempathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and\nintentions.

However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should\nalso result in better research after being executed. To test whether\nAI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution\nstudy by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,\neither written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100\nhours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the\nexperiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP\nresearchers.

Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on\nconjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \\geq t$ on a single input\nvariable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel\npolytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of\ninterpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the\ngradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of\nexpressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of\naxis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such\nfeatures, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and\ncomplexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the\nmodel. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical\npropositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,\ni.e., propositions of the form $\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T}\\mathbf{w} \\geq t$, where\n$\\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as\ngeneral polytopes with oblique faces.

While multimodal learning has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely\noverlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation\nlearning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular\nSMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn\nrich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive\ndataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional\nannotations.

On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments.

To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations.

Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which\nrefines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to\nobserved low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.\nExperimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that\nSSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL\napproaches in both efficiency and success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStrict Subgoal Execution (SSE) \u56fe\u57fa\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u7a0b\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u7a0b\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u56fe\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u6b65\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u7ec6\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u57fa\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSSE\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SSE\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u7a0b\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge.

By\nleveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,\nZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the\nLLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant\ndataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the\nZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical\nsolution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security\nguarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while\nensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6ZKPROV\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u6e90\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u4e25\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6388\u6743\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b7e\u540d\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u627f\u8bfa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eZKPROV\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "ZKPROV\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

Our approach incorporates\ngeometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.\nAdditionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances\nthe generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting\nin smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother\ntransitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally\nstable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nVideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and\nstability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both\nvisual quality and temporal coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVideoTex\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7f1d\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b33D\u7eb9\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b33D\u7eb9\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VideoTex\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u5229\u75283D\u7f51\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784-wise UV\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "VideoTex\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86UV\u8fb9\u754c\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u95f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u63a5\u7f1d\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoTex\u4e3a\u8981\u6c42\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade\nvalue estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the\nexisting policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through\niterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance\nminimization across incrementally perturbed observations.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream\nbackbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it\ndifficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel\nrelationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address\nthis issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration\nof local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise\nmodeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch\nconvolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a\ntemporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial\nConformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal\ndynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention\nmodule further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven\nimportance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)\ndatasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings\ndemonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline\nmodels, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG\nConformer baseline.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy.

This\nheterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but\nremains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types\nof nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very\nchallenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be\ncarefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert\nheterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which\nwill inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous\nrelations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of\nHomophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that\nexplicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and\nadaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH\nintroduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite\nsubgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs\nbased on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to\nalign heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual\ninformation.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

Despite their success,\ncurrent VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to\ncapture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for\ndistinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called\nMPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process\nof prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable\nrepresentations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt\ngeneration strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to\ngenerate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based\nexternal knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature\ndiscrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts.

While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway.

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench.

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size.

This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when\nonly fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked\nwith our BitMark.

We propose a novel\nperspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential\nequations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally\nstudied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is\nreformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the\noptimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been\nsystematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.\n  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and\noptimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for\nthe development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also\nprovide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem\nfor parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control\nproblem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions\nfor a corresponding approximated control problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u629b\u7269\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u4e3aPDEs\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u5076\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5f0f\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u629b\u7269\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3aPDEs\uff0c\u628a\u4f20\u7edfODEs\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aPDEs\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u629b\u7269PDEs\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u629b\u7269PDEs\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u66f2PDEs\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u5e94\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u629b\u7269\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The model is trained using a\nhybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete\nphase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the\nnetwork.

In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a\nconditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural\nsinging voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage\nand often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized\naudio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated\nwith two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch\narchitecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference\nto guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware\nsynthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel\nlow-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch\ncontours and long term spectral dependencies.

This\nwork proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration\nfor TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection.
