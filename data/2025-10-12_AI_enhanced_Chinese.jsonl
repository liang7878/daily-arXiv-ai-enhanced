To address this limitation, we\npropose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an\nexplainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between\nindividual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies\nsalient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding\nthrough a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their\nrepresentations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast\nnext-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model\ngenerates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of\neach keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to\n2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural\nnetworks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving\ncumulative returns by 18.5%.

We find\nsubstantial variation in interest income and expense betas, which drives\nvariation in net interest margin beta coefficients.

The system improves over time through a novel verbal\nfeedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly\nnatural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are\nthen injected into future prompts, allowing the system to adjust indicator\npriorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates\nor finetuning.

Drawing on a\nstructured survey of 100 respondents with varied demographic profiles, the\nstudy explores purchasing frequency, channel usage, price sensitivity, trust,\nand decision-making behaviors. Results indicate a clear shift toward digital\ntools, with many consumers valuing the speed, convenience, and transparency of\nonline platforms, particularly for simple insurance products. However, barriers\nremain, including concerns about data security, lack of personal guidance, and\ndifficulty understanding policy terms. A hybrid model is emerging, where online\ntools are used for research and comparison, while traditional agents are\nconsulted for complex decisions. Respondents emphasized the importance of trust\nand personal contact, showing that emotional and psychological factors still\nplay a role in digital adoption. Price was the dominant decision factor, but\nmany consumers also prioritized service quality and reliability. The study\nconcludes that insurers should invest in user-friendly digital experiences\nwhile maintaining human support options.

However, these\nsignals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user\nsatisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel\ncontent-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'\nintent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey\nmeasures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets\nforward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions\nand providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive\nRelevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,\ndiscriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we\nshow that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals\nand other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for\nusers with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy\nmodel that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage\nranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based\non this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,\nwhile reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale\nA/B experiments.

L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to\nenterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and\nmultimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are\nwell-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby\nimproving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN\narchitecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific\ncomponents at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic\nalgorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural\nsolution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook\nmodality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware\ncooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture\nsearch, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative\nco-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a\ncoordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific\ngene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator\nreassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively\ncaptures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we\nintroduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce\nevaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a\nsimilarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively\nbalance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and\navoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)\ndataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing\ncomputation cost by 27%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMACC - MGNAS\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728VulCE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u5927\uff0cMGNN\u9002\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u67b6\u6784\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709GA - GNAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMACC\u6846\u67b6\u6355\u83b7\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MADTS\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5c40\u90e8\u57fa\u56e0\u8fdb\u5316\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1SPDI\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728VulCE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c3 GPU - \u5c0f\u65f6\u5185F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe81.67%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u9ad88.7%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e27%\u3002", "conclusion": "MACC - MGNAS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

It pulls products toward a shared\ntemplate, making offerings look and feel more alike while making true\noriginality disproportionately expensive. We capture this centripetal force in\na standard two-stage differentiated-competition framework and show how a single\ncapability shift simultaneously compresses perceived differences, lowers\nmarginal cost and raises fixed access costs. The intuition is straightforward.\nWhen buyers see smaller differences across products, the payoff to standing\napart shrinks just as the effort to do so rises, so firms cluster around the\ntemplate. Prices fall and customers become more willing to switch. But the same\nhomogenization also squeezes operating margins, and rising fixed outlays deepen\nthe squeeze. The combination yields a structural prediction. There is a\ncapability threshold at which even two firms cannot both cover fixed costs, and\nin a many-firm extension the sustainable number of firms falls as capability\ngrows. Concentration increases, and prices still fall. Our results hold under\nbroader preference shapes, non-uniform consumer densities, outside options,\ncapability-dependent curvatures, and modest asymmetries. We translate the\ntheory into two sufficient statistics for enforcement. On the one hand, a\nconduct statistic and a viability statistic. Transactions or platform rules\nthat strengthen template pull or raise fixed access and originality costs can\nlower prices today yet push the market toward monoculture. Remedies that\nbroaden access and promote template plurality and interoperability preserve the\nprice benefits of AI while protecting entry and variety.

Naturally, connectivity was the first characteristic studied for\ndynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that undergo edge insertions and deletions.

Despite significant advances in\nlearning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain\ndifficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw\ndata or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To\novercome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit\ncardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these\ndependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven\ncardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw\ndata access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we\npropose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding\nraw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic\nrepresentation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a\nlarge-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard\non it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate\nrepresentations.

We propose a\nunique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to\nconsider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is\nfurther refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and\nmitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the\nVideo-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts\nfocus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the\nretrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further\nexperiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing\nstate-of-the-art models on five public datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u9891 - \u6587\u672c\u805a\u7c7b\uff08VTC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u542b\u72ec\u7279\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u548cSweeper\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709VTC - Att\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5404\u7c7b\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VTC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7528Sweeper\u6a21\u5757\u51cf\u5c11\u805a\u7c7b\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165VTC - Att\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u805a\u7c7b\u5185\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "VTC\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Yet, no existing benchmark adequately\nevaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software\nsystems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark\nconsisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android\napps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a\nlanguage model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android\napp from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding\nand coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,\ncalling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To\nconstruct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize\nthe main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize\ntest cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.\nFollowing rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE\nincorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that\nenables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily\nadoptable for future research.

We also find that significant\ndisparities can arise due to chance even from completely symmetric initial\nconditions, especially when populations are small. The introduction of even a\nslight asymmetry, where the group that has accumulated an advantage becomes\nslightly preferred, leads to a completely different outcome. In these\ninstances, starting from completely symmetric initial conditions, disparities\nbetween groups arise stochastically and then persist over time, yielding a\npermanent advantage for one group. Our analysis precisely characterizes\nconditions under which disparities persist or diminish, with a particular focus\non the role of the scarcity of available spots in the program and its\neffectiveness. We also present extensive simulations in a richer model that\nfurther support our theoretical results in the simpler, stylized model.

The manuscript is currently under review at Complex and\n  Intelligent Systems", "summary": "Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising\nfrom data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the\nDivide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training\ndata into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.\nThis strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the\ninfluence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation\ntypically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like\ndata size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying\ngeneralization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss\ncurves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of\nDUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization\nperformance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,\nestablishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating\noverfitting in modern deep learning.

This challenge\nprevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel\ngeneration task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that\ngenerates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,\nmotivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning\ntraces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this\npipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,\nwhich is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,\nreasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge.

We propose a simple\nalgorithm that adaptively selects questions to maximize Fisher information and\nupdates the estimate using a method-of-moments approach, paired with a novel\ntest statistic to decide when the estimate is accurate enough. We prove that\nthis Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both\nfixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the\nbest-arm identification literature. Our analysis overcomes a key technical\nchallenge in the fixed-budget setting -- handling the dependence between the\nevolving estimate and the query distribution -- by exploiting a structural\nsymmetry in the model and combining large deviation tools with Ville's\ninequality.

Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking\nframework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model\n(LLM)-driven automation.

Users report issues in natural\nlanguage, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request\nmissing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through\nno-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers.

We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that\ndecouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based\nneighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to\n$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity\ncomparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,\nreducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +\nd|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the\naccepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both\nstrongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression\npreserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where\napproximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective\nthreshold parameter.

Modern serving systems adopt stall-free\nscheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt\nprocessing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing\ndecode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs\nsubstantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert\nweight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy\nconsumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats\ntransformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically\npartitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill\nand decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding\nwhile eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip\nbandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and\nper-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill\nconsistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,\nreducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free\ndecoding.

Unfortunately, since\nmodels are usually trained solely based on samples from the original\n(unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased\ntest-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when\nperformative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the\nclassic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate\nseveral performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in\nthe label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels\nand the features.

LLM inference is composed of two phases with\ndistinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a\nmemory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes\nprefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,\nexisting hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.\nCurrent datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that\nmaximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth\nunderutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the\ndecode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving\ncosts.\n  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting\na less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct\ncharacteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have\nlarger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed\nDecode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared\nto modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%\nhigher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the\nproposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.\n  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware\ncost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while\noffering the same performance.

While significant progress has been\nmade, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum\ncontrol over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world\nsettings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where\none seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single\nlocal probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing\ntime evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which\nHamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of\ntools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we\nprove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are\nidentifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries.

We also present a convergence\nanalysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing\nclassification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound\nthat, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and\nquantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal\ndata, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view\nindependence.

We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram\nthat exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative\nmagnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width.

A\nsignificant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their\nreliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or\nsecurity concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time\nGraph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without\naccessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as\na generative graph restoration problem, \"restoring the target graph to its\npristine, source-domain-like state\". There are two key challenges: (1) We need\nto construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective\nencoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We\nneed to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic\nfeatures of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To\nensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores\nthe target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.\nSpecifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent\nfeatures and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration\nprocess. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete\ntokens.

The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but\nmay trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.\nFrom there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive\nfeedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a\nresult. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new\nenvironments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with\ncounterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions\nand contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with\nvocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based\nmulti-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves\nperfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm\ncompetitive with classical designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faExpA\u548cEARL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u52a8\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u5e26\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5185\u5316\u5230\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08ExpA\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684ExpA\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08EARL\uff09\u3002", "result": "EARL\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u6392\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8eSort - 4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

At the\nheart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires\nsimultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing\npath search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to\ncity-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and\ncoupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose\nCityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle\nnavigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which\ncoordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local\nnavigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global\ndirectives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative\nreasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a\ndual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while\nshared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to\n1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate\nthat CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based\nbaselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our\nresults highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and\ncooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for\nintelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

To prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization\ntechnique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which\npenalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids\nof the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks.

Controlling\nthe length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open\nchallenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent\npositive correlation between model entropy and response length at different\nreasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher\nentropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final\nanswer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This\nobservation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a\ncontrol knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,\nthis paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism\nthat incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of\ntreating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the\nthinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,\nwhich encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain\nsufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive\ncontrol of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid\ntruncation rules.

Intuitively speaking, the flatter the\nlandscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.\nUnfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the\ngeneralization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform}\n(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping\nthe sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the\n\\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of\nthe eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller\nthe (R\\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\\'enyi\nSharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\\'enyi Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware\nminimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our\nproposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\\%, compared against the\nclassical SAM method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cfR\u00e9nyi sharpness\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRSAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9510\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u7f29\u5c0f\u76f4\u89c9\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49R\u00e9nyi sharpness\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5dee\u5f02\u8f6c\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u5de7\u7ed9\u51fa\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRSAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1R\u00e9nyi sharpness\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0cRSAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178SAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u8fd12.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "R\u00e9nyi sharpness\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0cRSAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their application is limited by the\nhigh cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of\ninconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value\nscales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel\nelicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM\nrequires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and\nconsistent comparison matrix.

Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI\nPrediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a\nnovel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical\ninformation into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density\nmaps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction\nrisks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic\nproperties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure\ninteractions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of\ndrug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442\nsubstructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a\ncomparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically\nsignificant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),\nand the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of\nELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer\ncombinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMMM\u6846\u67b6\u5c063D\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u836f\u7269\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728MIMIC - III\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7528\u836f\u3002", "motivation": "\u836f\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u836f\u7269 - \u836f\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08DDI\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528ELF\u751f\u62103D\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ELF\u884d\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u836f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC - III\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u3001Jaccard\u6307\u6570\u548cDDI\u7387\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eELF\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show that SNNs can be\nnaturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient\nself-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and\nevaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the\nweak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient\nself-distillation schemes: (1) \\textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the\nstronger \"teacher\" guides the weaker \"student\", effectively improving overall\nperformance.

However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically\nrequire costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state\ninformation (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection\ntrajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need\nfor location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model\n(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,\nwhile simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The\nprimary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel\npropagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical\nlocations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)\nindoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that\njointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of\nthe user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is\nmodeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models\nfor LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a\nGaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility\nmodel, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously.

When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear\nmode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width\nensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance\nof finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,\neven without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for\nachieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further\nexplain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.\nSpecifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity\n(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be\nrepresented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the\ncorresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's\noutput matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates\nLMC.

However, they often retain irrelevant\ninformation beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising\nconcerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This\nhas motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to\nselectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model\nperformance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily\nfocused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize\nspecified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely\nforgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For\ninstance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars\nwhile avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside\nadvertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we\nintroduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that\nrequires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,\nillustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU\npresents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization\ncapability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in\nthe feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains\nineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that\nexplicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures\ninstance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our\napproach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way\nfor practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:\nhttps://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9886\u57df\u9057\u5fd8\uff08ADU\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u8c03\u6574\u6280\u672f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u9886\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6355\u83b7\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u8c03\u6574\u6280\u672f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aVLMs\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,\nbidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and\nscalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR\ngeneration by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from\nnon-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with\ntwo decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological\nfeatures, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging\nthese bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables\nthe AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,\nenriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training\nstrategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder\ngradient blocking for stable, focused learning.

It uniquely harmonizes AR\nstability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior\nperformance on diverse downstream data.

However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,\nprincipally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising\navenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly\nreal-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly\ncomplex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and\nflow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or\npolicy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability\nto larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to\ndevelop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or\nbackpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that\nintegrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns\nan optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At\ninference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection\nsampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient\noptimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.\nEmpirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of\noffline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value\nlearning into offline RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5EVOR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b66\u4e60Q\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56BPTT\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faExpressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u6b63\u5219\u5316Q\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "EVOR\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u76ca\u3002"}}

Due to the limited availability of\nhigh-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI\nclassification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in\nbalancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI\nclassification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial\ndata to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To\naddress this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion\nNetwork (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to\ncomplement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our\nmodel on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,\nHyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance\nboost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and\nspectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically\naugmented HSI classification models.

Our framework supports both shared base\narchitectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert\nmodels, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and\nspecialization.

Training dynamics also suggest a\nsecond obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We\nhypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving\nAverage (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random\nhyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both\nmechanisms.

We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge\nand fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that\nincludes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings\nreveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates\nthe lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also\nextend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired\nwith CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource\nimplications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing\ncapabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u96fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SimCLR\u80fd\u8017\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u6709\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30SimCLR\u3001MoCo\u3001SimSiam\u548cBarlow Twins\u56db\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u62ec\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "SimCLR\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u80fd\u8017\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18/\u96fe\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u8f9f\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity\nvessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal\nfluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits\nthe extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this\nlimitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models\nto allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and\nrestore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models\n(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a\nunique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images\nacquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of\nx2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity\nand distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded\ninconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This\nraises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently\ntarget the specific structure of dental porosity.

Such conditions are commonly\nencountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure\nsettings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,\nmaking it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details\nsimultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends\nusing short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and\nghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains\nsufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in\ndenoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB\nimages, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise\ncharacteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This\nraises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only\na single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single\nshort-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making\nit particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce\nUltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio\nmap to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to\nenhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a\n9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a\ncorresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure\nas input for reconstruction.

The widespread adoption of\nthis tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific\ntools.

Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent\nframework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code\nto extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a\nreviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete\nfunctional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous\nquestion-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools\nwithout loss of functionality.

This is accomplished\nwhile improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%\nand concurrently lowering the under-search rate.

Sabuncu", "Amy Kuceyeski"], "title": "Beyond Grid-Locked Voxels: Neural Response Functions for Continuous Brain Encoding", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.LG", "eess.IV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to\nnatural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each\nvoxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional\nencoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel\nresponses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards\nanatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid.\nWe introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI\nactivity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat\nvector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit\nfunction: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI\nspace, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation\ndecouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary\nspatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the\nmodel in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses:\n(1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns;\nmodeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data\nefficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data\nacross individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned\non new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both\nintrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance\nwhile reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude.

In this work, we explore a\ncounterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language\nmodels (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the\nlatter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that\nleverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a\nweaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a\nsampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs\nsupervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur\ncontrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these\ndistilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven\nmathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while\nreducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token\nusage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels.

This paper investigates the critical\ntrade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art\nSwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\non this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but\nimportant finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher\npeak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the\nlightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,\nthe CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of\ntraining, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This\nefficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times\nsmaller than SwinIR.

Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn\nrepresentations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a\nthreshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these\nmethods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,\nleading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a\nmulti-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,\nwhich constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge\npropagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the\ninteraction relations between instances with class information to propagate\nlabel knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)\ninstances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between\ninstances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent\nfor multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed\nto optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.\nExperiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC\nand 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u53cc\u5173\u7cfb\u589e\u5f3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u793a\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u4f20\u64ad\u6807\u7b7e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u53cc\u5173\u7cfb\u589e\u5f3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u652f\u6301\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57281 - shot\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747AUC\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad89.54%\uff0cMacro - F1\u9ad811.19%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, detecting such\nvideos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal\ndynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this\npaper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based\non probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a\nstatistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the\nratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly\ncapturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained\ndiffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients\napproximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion\ndecomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we\npropose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a\ndetection metric.

In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual\nInstruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual\npre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for\nbusiness conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that\nrely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and\nresponses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling\nbetter instruction generalization.

However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus\non semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models\noften generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no\ncorresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination\nand identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the\nprevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current\nmetrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation\nframework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event\ndetectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and\nseverity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and\nIH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose\nPosterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that\nmitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial\naudio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio\nafter masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments\non several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models\nsuffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence\nand duration of hallucinations by over 50\\% on average, without degrading, and\nin some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and\ntemporal synchronization.

Deep learning (DL) based\nsegmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting\nand delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.\nAchieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as\nradiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.\nHowever, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to\nCT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities\nmeasure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning.

However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in\nLLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token\nhypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens\nactivate the most predictive features from context and govern next token\nprediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case\nstudies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive\nfeatures from context to direct next token prediction.

To explore this, we finetune open-sourced\nLLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.\nAdditionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined\nfinetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment\ndata into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior\nover 20%.

Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both\nreal and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and\ncostly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse\ndatasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDexMan\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6f14\u793a\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cc\u624b\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u76f8\u673a\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4f7f\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u521a\u4f53\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u624b - \u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728TACO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0cADD - S\u548cVSD\u7edd\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.08\u548c0.12\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728OakInk - v2\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd519%\u3002", "conclusion": "DexMan\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u521b\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce\nGaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal\nattention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the\nagent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that\nreturn differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations\nproduce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely\ntask-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized\nthrough return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to\ndistinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group\nsimilar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their\nreturn differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive\ntriplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention\nmechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with\ndifferent outcomes.

These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM).

However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens.

Existing\napproaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack\neffective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory\nincorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only\nenvironmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that\nencode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs\nimagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model\nimagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant\nenvironmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)\na language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual\npurposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)\nHybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral\npatterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an\nexperience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge\nthrough specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse\nmemory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios\ndemonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all\nscenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent\nbaseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory\nreduction.

Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on\nfine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.\nWe present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task\ndescription into an actionable plan for a target robot without any\ndemonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a\nvideo generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using\noff-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative\nposes for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals\nand trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a\ntracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics\nmodel. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow\nnaturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and\ndeformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot\nquadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without\ndemonstrations or embodiment-specific training.
