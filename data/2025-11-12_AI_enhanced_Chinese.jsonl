This enables efficient, massively parallel computation on modern GPUs, resulting in up to a 10-15x reduction in memory usage and a 4x speed up in runtime, particularly for multilayer dielectric structures. Our method emphasizes high-energy propagation paths, efficiently capturing long multipath and interreflection effects.

Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability.

Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations.

Traditional deterministic approaches often ignore geological uncertainty, leading to suboptimal and potentially infeasible production schedules. Chance constraints allow modeling of stochastic components by ensuring probabilistic constraints are satisfied with high probability. This paper presents a bi-objective formulation of the OPMSP that simultaneously maximizes expected net present value and minimizes scheduling risk, independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. Solutions are represented using integer encoding, inherently satisfying reserve constraints. We introduce a domain-specific greedy randomized initialization and a precedence-aware period-swap mutation operator. We integrate these operators into three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO), a mutation-only variant of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). We compare our bi-objective formulation against the single-objective approach, which depends on a specific confidence level, by analyzing mine deposits consisting of up to 112 687 blocks.

To support effective trading, signaling mechanisms provide participants with information about data products before transactions, enabling informed decisions and facilitating trading. However, due to the inherent free-duplication nature of data, commonly practiced signaling methods face a dilemma between privacy and reliability, undermining the effectiveness of signals in guiding decision-making.\n  To address this, this paper explores the benefits and develops a non-TCP-based construction for a desirable signaling mechanism that simultaneously ensures privacy and reliability. We begin by formally defining the desirable utility signaling mechanism and proving its ability to prevent suboptimal decisions for both participants and facilitate informed data trading. To design a protocol to realize its functionality, we propose leveraging maliciously secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and robustness of signal computation and introduce an MPC-based hash verification scheme to ensure input reliability. In multi-seller scenarios requiring fair data valuation, we further explore the design and optimization of the MPC-based KNN-Shapley method with improved efficiency.

By employing separate ML models for caching and prefetching, plus a novel differentiable loss function, RecMG narrows the prefetching search space and minimizes on-demand fetches. Compared to state-of-the-art temporal, spatial, and ML-based prefetchers, RecMG reduces on-demand fetches by 2.2x, 2.8x, and 1.5x, respectively.

To capture the path-dependent nature of volatility dynamics, our model is conditioned on a rich set of market variables, including exponential weighted moving averages (EWMAs) of historical surfaces, returns and squared returns of underlying asset, and scalar risk indicators like VIX. Empirical results demonstrate our model significantly outperforms leading GAN-based models in capturing the stylized facts of IV dynamics. A key challenge is that historical data often contains small arbitrage opportunities in the earlier dataset for training, which conflicts with the goal of generating arbitrage-free surfaces. We address this by incorporating a standard arbitrage penalty into the loss function, but apply it using a novel, parameter-free weighting scheme based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that dynamically adjusts the penalty's strength across the diffusion process. We also show a formal analysis of this trade-off and provide a proof of convergence showing that the penalty introduces a small, controllable bias that steers the model toward the manifold of arbitrage-free surfaces while ensuring the generated distribution remains close to the real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u542b\u5957\u5229\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u66f2\u9762\u4e0d\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5957\u5229\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u5e02\u573a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u5957\u5229\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9\u6743\u8861\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u6349\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5178\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u9690\u542b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u66f2\u9762\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8d8b\u5411\u65e0\u5957\u5229\u66f2\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Because of this, artificial intelligence (AI) models used to assist such decisions are frequently trained with asymmetric loss functions that incorporate human decision-makers' trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. In two focal applications, we show that this standard alignment practice can backfire. In both cases, it would be better to train the machine learning model with a loss function that ignores the human's objective and then adjust predictions ex post according to that objective. We rationalize this result using an economic model of incentive design with endogenous information acquisition. The key insight from our theoretical framework is that machine classifiers perform not one but two incentivized tasks: choosing how to classify and learning how to classify. We show that while the adjustments engineers use correctly incentivize choosing, they can simultaneously reduce the incentives to learn. Our formal treatment of the problem reveals that methods embraced for their intuitive appeal can in fact misalign human and machine objectives in predictable ways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff0c\u5e94\u5148\u5ffd\u7565\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u4e8b\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e0bAI\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u5408\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u70b9\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u5185\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u505a\u6cd5\u4f1a\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff0c\u5148\u5ffd\u7565\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u8c03\u6574\u867d\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u5206\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u89c2\u4e0a\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ee5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined.

For compatibility prediction, an \"outfit token\" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset.

Cash transfer (CT) programmes are considered one of the main social protection strategies and an instrument for achieving SDG 1. Targeting consists of establishing eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of CT programmes. In low-income countries, where resources are limited, proper targeting of CTs is essential for an efficient use of resources. Given the growing importance of microinsurance as a complementary tool to social protection strategies, this study examines its role as a supplement to CT programmes. In this article, we adopt the piecewise-deterministic Markov process introduced in Kovacevic and Pflug (2011) to model the capital of a household, which when exposed to large proportional capital losses (in contrast to the classical Cram\u00e9r-Lundberg model) can push them into the poverty area. Striving for cost-effective CT programmes, we optimise the expected discounted cost of keeping the household's capital above the poverty line by means of injection of capital (as a direct capital transfer). Using dynamic programming techniques, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the optimal control problem of determining the amount of capital to inject over time. We show that this equation admits a viscosity solution that can be approximated numerically. Moreover, in certain special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the solution. Numerical examples show that there is an optimal level of injection above the poverty threshold, suggesting that efficient use of resources is achieved when CTs are preventive rather than reactive, since injecting capital into households when their capital levels are above the poverty line is less costly than to do so only when it falls below the threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u989d\u4fdd\u9669\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u91d1\u8f6c\u79fb\uff08CT\uff09\u8ba1\u5212\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u786e\u5b9a\u6ce8\u8d44\u91d1\u989d\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u8868\u660e\u9884\u9632\u6027CT\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5c0f\u989d\u4fdd\u9669\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0cCT\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u9776\u5411\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u989d\u4fdd\u9669\u5bf9CT\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8865\u5145\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Kovacevic\u548cPflug\uff082011\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u8d44\u672c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6280\u672f\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6ce8\u8d44\u91d1\u989d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u7684HJB\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "HJB\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6570\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7c98\u6027\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8d2b\u56f0\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6ce8\u8d44\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u9632\u6027CT\u6bd4\u53cd\u5e94\u6027CT\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

As real-world graphs continue to grow beyond the memory capacity of single machines, out-of-core graph processing systems have emerged as a viable solution.

In particular, their scheduling mechanisms lead to I/O inefficiencies, stemming from read and work amplification, and induce costly synchronization stalls hindering sustained disk utilization.

Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions.

In our setting, the centralized allocator is interested in ensuring the allocation is fair among the groups and between agents. This setting applies to many real-world scenarios, including when a school administrator wants to allocate resources (e.g., office spaces and supplies) to staff members in departments and when a city council allocates limited housing units to various families in need across different communities. To ensure fair allocation between agents, we consider the classical envy-freeness (EF) notion. To ensure fairness among the groups, we define the notion of centralized group equitability (CGEQ) to capture the fairness for the groups from the allocator's perspective.

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

InkubaLM on Jetson Nano achieved a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 129 ms, an average inter-token latency of 33 ms, and a throughput of 45.2 tokens per second while consuming 8.4 W. On Raspberry Pi 4B, InkubaLM also led with 326 ms TTFT and 15.9 tokens per second at 5.8 W power consumption. The framework consistently delivered high multilingual quality, averaging a BLEU score of 0.688, cultural relevance of 4.4/5, and fluency of 4.2/5 across tested African languages.

To generalize these transformations between arbitrary distributions, recent work has focused on the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (SB) problem.

We introduce a closed-form framework for learning SB dynamics that unifies and extends previously known closed-form solutions, including the Schr\u00f6dinger F\u00f6llmer process and the Gaussian SB. Notably, the classical Gaussian SB solution arises as an immediate corollary of our formulation.

While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks.

However, existing schemes such as rate coding, Poisson encoding, and time-to-first-spike (TTFS) often ignore spatial relationships and yield temporally inconsistent spike patterns. In this article, a novel cluster-based encoding approach is proposed, which leverages local density computation to preserve semantic structure in both spatial and temporal domains. This method introduces a 2D spatial cluster trigger that identifies foreground regions through connected component analysis and local density estimation. Then, extend to a 3D spatio-temporal (ST3D) framework that jointly considers temporal neighborhoods, producing spike trains with improved temporal consistency. Experiments on the N-MNIST dataset demonstrate that our ST3D encoder achieves 98.17% classification accuracy with a simple single-layer SNN, outperforming standard TTFS encoding (97.58%) and matching the performance of more complex deep architectures while using significantly fewer spikes (~3800 vs ~5000 per sample).

Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability.

Data annotation, once lauded as a democratizing force within the global gig economy, has evolved into a segmented labor market characterized by low wages, limited protections, and unequal access to higher-skilled annotation tasks. Drawing on an exploratory survey of 30 Latin American data annotators, supplemented by qualitative accounts and comparative secondary literature, this study situates female annotators within broader debates in labor economics, including segmentation theory, monopsony power in platform labor, and the reserve army of labor. Findings indicate that women are disproportionately drawn into annotation due to caregiving obligations and political-economic instability in countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru. Respondents highlight low pay, irregular access to tasks, and lack of benefits as central challenges, while also expressing ambivalence about whether their work is valued relative to male counterparts.

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning.

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{GenCDR}, a novel \\textbf{Gen}erative \\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{D}omain \\textbf{R}ecommendation framework. GenCDR first employs a \\textbf{Domain-adaptive Tokenization} module, which generates disentangled semantic IDs for items by dynamically routing between a universal encoder and domain-specific adapters. Symmetrically, a \\textbf{Cross-domain Autoregressive Recommendation} module models user preferences by fusing universal and domain-specific interests.

We present an exploratory empirical eye-tracking study to investigate 1) how developers classify the predominant paradigm in Python code and 2) how the paradigm affects their ability to debug Python code. The goal is to uncover if specific language features are looked at more often while classifying and debugging code with a predominant paradigm. Twenty-nine developers (primarily students) were recruited for the study and were each given four classification and four debugging tasks in Python. Eye movements were recorded during all the tasks. The results indicate confusion in labeling Functional and Procedural paradigms, but not Object-Oriented. The code with predominantly functional paradigms also took the longest to complete. Changing the predominant paradigm did not affect the ability to debug the code, though developers did rate themselves with lower confidence for Functional code. We report significant differences in reading patterns during debugging, especially in the Functional code.

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6PQFL\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PQFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "PQFL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e23%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0cAUROC\u63d0\u534724.2%\uff0cAUPR\u63d0\u534720.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "PQFL\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, accurate Bayesian inference relies on the assumption that one's statistical model of the data-generating process is correctly specified. If this assumption is violated, Bayesian methods can lead to poor inference and estimates of information gain. Generalised Bayesian (or Gibbs) inference is a more robust probabilistic inference framework that replaces the likelihood in the Bayesian update by a suitable loss function. In this work, we present Generalised Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (GBOED), an extension of Gibbs inference to the experimental design setting which achieves robustness in both design and inference. Using an extended information-theoretic framework, we derive a new acquisition function, the Gibbs expected information gain (Gibbs EIG).

Beyond hotfixes, many incidents were mitigated via traffic routing, node rebalancing, or capacity increase policies, indicating further automation opportunities. We also show how the taxonomy guided targeted strategies such as connection liveness, GPU capacity-aware routing, and per-endpoint isolation and reduced incident impact and accelerated recovery.

An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.\n  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.\n  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.\n  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D.

However, in many scenarios, division of resources has a direct impact on the whole group or even society. Therefore, we study fair allocations of indivisible items that, at the same time, maximize social impact. In this model, each agent is associated with two additive functions that define their value and social impact for each item. The goal is to allocate items so that the social impact is maximized while maintaining some fairness criterion. We reveal that the complexity of the problem heavily depends on whether the agents are socially aware, i.e., they take into consideration the social impact functions. For socially unaware agents, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for a variety of fairness notions, and that it is tractable only for very restricted cases, e.g., if, for every agent, the valuation equals social impact and it is binary. On the other hand, social awareness allows for fair allocations that maximize social impact, and such allocations can be computed in polynomial time.

An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\u03bc$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\u03bc$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\u03bc$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\u03bc$ is bounded.\n  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\u03bd$ that approximates~$\u03bc$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\u03bd$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\u03bc$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\u03bd$.

The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency.

We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so.

Hard-negative mining typically relies on ranking documents using cross-encoders or static embedding models based on similarity metrics such as cosine distance. Hard negative mining becomes challenging for biomedical and scientific domains due to the difficulty in distinguishing between source and hard negative documents. However, referenced documents naturally share contextual relevance with the source document but are not duplicates, making them well-suited as hard negatives. In this work, we propose BiCA: Biomedical Dense Retrieval with Citation-Aware Hard Negatives, an approach for hard-negative mining by utilizing citation links in 20,000 PubMed articles for improving a domain-specific small dense retriever. We fine-tune the GTE_small and GTE_Base models using these citation-informed negatives and observe consistent improvements in zero-shot dense retrieval using nDCG@10 for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks on BEIR and outperform baselines on long-tailed topics in LoTTE using Success@5.

However, existing software architecture patterns are static, while current safety assurance methods are not scalable, leaving systems vulnerable to novel adversarial threats.\n  Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a novel software architecture that enables an AI-driven system to autonomously and continuously adapt its own safety protocols at runtime.\n  Method: We propose the Self-Improving Safety Framework (SISF), a runtime architecture that couples an unprotected, unaligned base LLM (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) with a dynamic feedback loop. This loop consists of an AI Adjudicator (GPT-4o) for breach detection and a Policy Synthesis Module (GPT-4 Turbo) that autonomously generates new, generalized safety policies (both heuristic and semantic) in response to failures.\n  Results: We conducted a dynamic learning evaluation using the 520-prompt AdvBench dataset. The unprotected model was 100% vulnerable. Our SISF, starting from zero policies, demonstrated a clear learning curve: it detected 237 breaches, autonomously synthesized 234 new policies, and reduced the overall Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 45.58%. In a subsequent test on 520 benign prompts, the SISF achieved a 0.00% False Positive Rate (FPR), proving its ability to adapt without compromising user utility.\n  Conclusion: An architectural approach to AI safety, based on the principles of self-adaptation, is a viable and effective strategy.

Extansive works adopt the framework of distributionally robust RL, to learn a policy that acts robustly under worst case environment shift. Within this framework, our objective is to devise algorithms that are sample efficient with interactive data collection and large state spaces. By assuming d-rectangularity of environment dynamic shift, we identify a fundamental hardness result for learning in online Markov game, and address it by adopting minimum value assumption. Then, a novel least square value iteration type algorithm, DR-CCE-LSI, with exploration bonus devised specifically for multiple agents, is proposed to find an \\episilon-approximate robust Coarse Correlated Equilibrium(CCE). To obtain sample efficient learning, we find that: when the feature mapping function satisfies certain properties, our algorithm, DR-CCE-LSI, is able to achieve \u03b5-approximate CCE with a regret bound of O{dHmin{H,1/min{\u03c3_i}}\\sqrt{K}}, where K is the number of interacting episodes, H is the horizon length, d is the feature dimension, and \\simga_i represents the uncertainty level of player i. Our work introduces the first sample-efficient algorithm for this setting, matches the best result so far in single agent setting, and achieves minimax optimalsample complexity in terms of the feature dimension d. Meanwhile, we also conduct simulation study to validate the efficacy of our algorithm in learning a robust equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama.

Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals: in equilibrium, the designer may deliberately reward those with lower likelihood ratios or concentrate rewards/penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u505a\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u5219\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u505a\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aStackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u8c03\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u5219\u5c5e\u4e8e\u5c0f\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08\u5355\u9608\u503c\u548c\u53cc\u622a\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5956\u52b1\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u4f4e\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u6216\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5956\u60e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

An algorithm proposed by Micali and Vazirani (1980) is well-known to solve the problem in $O(m\\sqrt{n})$ time, which is still one of the fastest algorithms in general. While the MV algorithm itself is not so complicated and is indeed convincing, its correctness proof is extremely challenging, which can be seen from the history: after the first algorithm paper had appeared in 1980, Vazirani has made several attempts to give a complete proof for more than 40 years. It seems, roughly speaking, caused by the nice but highly complex structure of the shortest alternating paths in general graphs that are deeply intertwined with the so-called (nested) blossoms.\n  In this paper, we propose a new structure theorem on the shortest alternating paths in general graphs without taking into the details of blossoms. The high-level idea is to forget the alternation (of matching and non-matching edges) as early as possible. A key ingredient is a notion of alternating base trees (ABTs) introduced by Izumi, Kitamura, and Yamaguchi (2024) to develop a nearly linear-time distributed algorithm. Our structure theorem refines the properties of ABTs exploited in their algorithm, and we also give simpler alternative proofs for them. Based on our structure theorem, we propose a new algorithm, which is slightly slower but more implementable and much easier to confirm its correctness than the MV algorithm.\n  As applications of our framework, we also present new $(1 - \u03b5)$-approximation algorithms in the distributed and semi-streaming settings. Both algorithms are deterministic, and substantially improve the best known upper bounds on the running time. The algorithms are built on the top of a novel framework of amplifying approximation factors of given matchings, which is of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u6700\u77ed\u4ea4\u66ff\u8def\u5f84\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u534a\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u65b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Micali\u548cVazirani\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u6781\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u57fa\u6570\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u82b1\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u57fa\u6811\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4MV\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u786e\u8ba4\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u57fa\u6570\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In contrast to the maximum entropy principle, which predicts an exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution with moderate inequality for unconstrained wealth exchange, we demonstrate that these realistic trading rules drive the system toward a highly unequal steady state. We develop a self-consistent mean-field theory, deriving a master equation where agent income follows a Poisson process coupled to the poverty rate. Numerical solution reveals a stationary distribution characterized by a substantial pauper class, high Gini coefficient, and exponential tail--significantly deviating from the maximum entropy benchmark. Agent-based simulations confirm these findings. We identify the poverty trap as the key mechanism: the liquidity constraint creates asymmetric economic agency, where zero-wealth agents become passive recipients, unable to participate in wealth circulation. This work establishes that substantial inequality can emerge spontaneously from equal-opportunity exchanges under basic economic constraints, without requiring agent heterogeneity or multiplicative advantage, providing a mechanistic foundation for understanding poverty as an emergent property of exchange rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7b80\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u672c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u4f1a\u4ea4\u6362\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u5de8\u5927\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56fa\u5b9a\u91d1\u989d\u4ea4\u6613\u548c\u786c\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6781\u7b80\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u81ea\u6d3d\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u8d8b\u5411\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u7a33\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u8d2b\u56f0\u9636\u5c42\u3001\u9ad8\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5c3e\u90e8\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u672c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u4f1a\u4ea4\u6362\u80fd\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u5de8\u5927\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8d2b\u56f0\u662f\u4ea4\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising.

While prior studies have examined sustainability in large language models, existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for evaluating accuracy-energy trade-offs in Code Language Models (CLMs). In this paper, we present a framework, BRACE, to benchmark CLMs on a unified scale of energy efficiency and functional correctness (referred to as accuracy). We benchmark 22 state-of-the-art models on code generation and summarization tasks, proposing two rating methods: Concentric Incremental Rating Circles (CIRC) and Observation to Expectation Rating (OTER). CIRC provides deterministic Euclidean-based rankings with static trade-offs that are robust to outliers, and OTER offers trend-aware evaluation with dynamic trade-offs that capture the complex correlation between energy and accuracy, each offering a distinct perspective and addressing the problem in a unique way. These rating methods enable us to rate LLMs on a 1-5 scale reflecting their combined capabilities in terms of energy efficiency and functional correctness. Our analysis reveals models generally perform better in the code summarization tasks as they are not enforced to generate a grammar-based and syntactically correct output. Also, we find that models' size does not have a significant impact on their ratings, indicating that if models utilize their parameters efficiently, they can be ranked higher on these scales. The proposed BRACE framework empowers practitioners to make evidence-based model selections that balance sustainability with task requirements, guiding rating choice -- CIRC for deterministic comparisons or OTER for trend-aware evaluation -- based on deployment priorities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBRACE\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf922\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027 - \u80fd\u6e90\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBRACE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf922\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCIRC\u548cOTER\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u603b\u7ed3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8bc4\u7ea7\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "BRACE\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.\n  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.\n  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.\n  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.\n  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6RELEAP\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\u6307\u5bfc\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u4ee3\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRELEAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u675c\u514b\u5927\u5b66\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548cCox\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "RELEAP\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52AUC\u4ece0.774\u63d0\u5347\u52300.805\uff0c\u751f\u5b58C\u6307\u6570\u4ece0.718\u63d0\u5347\u52300.752\uff0c\u6bd4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u76ca\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "RELEAP\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u578b\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9MCP\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "MCP\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0token\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6743\u8861\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9MCP\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5065\u58ee\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684MCP\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We are given multiple agents with hidden values (or quality scores), to whom resources must be allocated by a welfare-maximizing decision-maker. An intermediary with knowledge of the agents' values seeks to influence the outcome of the selection by designing informative signals and providing tie-breaking policies, so that when the receiver maximizes welfare over the resulting posteriors, the expected utilities of the agents (where utility is defined as allocation times value) achieve certain fairness properties. The fairness measure we will use is majorization, which simultaneously approximately maximizes all symmetric, monotone, concave functions of the utilities. We consider the general setting where the allocation to the agents needs to respect arbitrary submodular constraints, as given by the corresponding polymatroid.\n  We present a signaling policy that, under a mild bounded rationality assumption on the receiver, achieves a logarithmically approximate majorized policy in this setting. The approximation ratio is almost best possible, and that significantly outperforms generic results that only yield linear approximations. A key component of our result is a structural characterization showing that the vector of agent utilities for a given signaling policy defines the base polytope of a different polymatroid, a result that may be of independent interest.

This problem has been extensively studied over the last decade leading to many results that achieve ever-improving bounds on the recourse and update time, while maintaining a solution whose cost is comparable to that of offline approximation algorithms.\n  In this paper, we give the first algorithms to simultaneously achieve non-trivial worst-case bounds for recourse and update time.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence.

Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism.

However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.\n  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\\times$ speedups.

Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications.

In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a \"see-saw\" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \\textbf{HID} (\\textbf{H}ybrid \\textbf{I}ntent-based \\textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional \"see-saw\" into \"win-win\" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \\textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \\textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \\textit{diversity} and \\textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions.

The workflows themselves, however, become increasingly complex in terms of involved components. Furthermore, they are executed on distributed cluster infrastructures, which makes the real-time collection, integration, and analysis of provenance data challenging. Existing provenance systems struggle to balance scalability, real-time processing, online provenance analytics, and integration across different components and compute resources. Moreover, most provenance solutions are not workflow-aware; by focusing on arbitrary workloads, they miss opportunities for workflow systems where optimization and analysis can exploit the availability of a workflow specification that dictates, to some degree, task execution orders and provides abstractions for physical tasks at a logical level.\n  In this paper, we present HyProv, a hybrid provenance management system that combines centralized and federated paradigms to offer scalable, online, and workflow-aware queries over workflow provenance traces. HyProv uses a centralized component for efficient management of the small and stable workflow-specification-specific provenance, and complements this with federated querying over different scalable monitoring and provenance databases for the large-scale execution logs. This enables low-latency access to current execution data. Furthermore, the design supports complex provenance queries, which we exemplify for the workflow system Airflow in combination with the resource manager Kubernetes. Our experiments indicate that HyProv scales to large workflows, answers provenance queries with sub-second latencies, and adds only modest CPU and memory overhead to the cluster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6eaf\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfHyProv\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6eaf\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u4e14\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6eaf\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u975e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89c4\u8303\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "HyProv\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u4e2d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89c4\u8303\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6267\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aHyProv\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e9a\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u56de\u7b54\u6eaf\u6e90\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ec5\u7ed9\u96c6\u7fa4\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "HyProv\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6eaf\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants.

This paper was accepted to the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 2026. This is a pre-print version", "summary": "Reconfigurable networks are a novel communication paradigm in which the pattern of connectivity between hosts varies rapidly over time. Prior theoretical work explored the inherent tradeoffs between throughput (or, hop-count) and latency, and showed the existence of infinitely many Pareto-optimal designs as the network size tends to infinity. Existing Pareto-optimal designs use a connection schedule which is fine-tuned to the desired hop-count $h$, permitting lower latency as $h$ increases. However, in reality datacenter workloads contain a mix of low-latency and high-latency requests. Using a connection schedule fine-tuned for one request type leads to inefficiencies when serving other types.\n  A more flexible and efficient alternative is a {\\em universal schedule}, a single connection schedule capable of attaining many Pareto-optimal tradeoff points simultaneously, merely by varying the choice of routing paths. In this work we present the first universal schedules for oblivious routing. Our constructions yield universal schedules which are near-optimal for all possible hop-counts $h$. The key technical idea is to specialize to a type of connection schedule based on cyclic permutations and to develop a novel Fourier-analytic method for analyzing randomized routing on these connection schedules. We first show that a uniformly random connection schedule suffices with multiplicative error in throughput, and latency optimal up to a $\\log N$ factor. We then show that a more carefully designed random connection schedule suffices with additive error in throughput, but improved latency optimal up to only constant factors. Finally, we show that our first randomized construction can be made deterministic using a derandomized version of the Lovett-Meka discrepancy minimization algorithm to obtain the same result.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6784\u9020\u786e\u5b9a\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u8bf7\u6c42\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u7f6e\u6362\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528Lovett - Meka\u5dee\u5f02\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6784\u9020\u786e\u5b9a\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6709\u4e58\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fbeO(log N)\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u66f4\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6709\u52a0\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u6784\u9020\u786e\u5b9a\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u70b9\u3002"}}

This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u4f30\u503c\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf97\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u98ce\u6295\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u30017\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u30014\u9636\u6bb5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f46\u9700\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u6563\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u8fbe\u6210\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

A multimodal analysis of these projects led us to a novel visualization technique, providing a robust way to display both current and evolving software metrics over time, replacing multiple traditional visualizations with one. Additionally, our statistical analysis shows that even similar-domain projects sustain themselves differently.

Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%.

On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information.

There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments. Notably, it approaches the upper-bound performance of centralized systems under ideally reliable data environments.

It involves intentionally injecting faults into a system to test its resilience, uncover weaknesses, and address them before they cause failures in production. Recent CE tools automate the execution of predefined CE experiments. However, planning such experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. These processes are labor-intensive and require multi-domain expertise. To address these challenges and enable anyone to build resilient systems at low cost, this paper proposes ChaosEater, a system that automates the entire CE cycle with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines an agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided processes within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for software systems built on Kubernetes. Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater complete CE cycles through software engineering tasks, including requirement definition, code generation, testing, and debugging. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on small- and large-scale Kubernetes systems.

We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\u03b1$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+\u03b1)/(1-\u03b1)$ under feature overlap assumptions.

It is known that a monotone class defined by finitely many obstructions has bounded treewidth if and only if one of the obstructions is a so-called tripod, that is, a disjoint union of trees with exactly one vertex of degree 3 and paths. This dichotomy also characterizes exactly those monotone graph classes for which many NP-hard algorithmic problems admit polynomial-time algorithms. These algorithmic dichotomies, however, do not extend to the universe of all hereditary classes, which are classes closed under taking induced subgraphs. This leads to the natural question of whether we can extend known algorithmic dichotomies for monotone classes to larger families of hereditary classes. We give an affirmative answer to this question by considering the family of hereditary graph classes that are closed under self-intersection, which is known to be located strictly between the monotone and hereditary classes. We prove a new structural characterization of graphs in self-intersection-closed classes excluding a tripod. We use our characterization to give a complete dichotomy of Maximum Independent Set, and its weighted variant for self-intersection-closed classes defined by finitely many obstructions: these problems are in P if the class excludes a tripod and NP-hard otherwise. This generalizes several known results on Maximum Independent Set. We also use it to obtain dichotomies for Maximum Induced Matching on self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions. Similarly, we obtain dichotomies for Satisfiability and Counting Satisfiability on self-intersection-closed classes of (bipartite) incidence graphs defined by finitely many obstructions, and for boundedness of clique-width for self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5355\u8c03\u56fe\u7c7b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u56fe\u7c7b\u65cf\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u4ea4\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u56fe\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u77e5\u5355\u8c03\u56fe\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6240\u6709\u9057\u4f20\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u5426\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u9057\u4f20\u7c7b\u65cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u4ea4\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u56fe\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6392\u9664\u4e09\u811a\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u4ea4\u5c01\u95ed\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u5927\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u52a0\u6743\u53d8\u4f53\u3001\u6700\u5927\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5339\u914d\u3001\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u6570\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u7c7b\u56e2\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6709\u754c\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80af\u5b9a\u4e86\u5c06\u5355\u8c03\u7c7b\u5df2\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u81ea\u4ea4\u5c01\u95ed\u9057\u4f20\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Ensuring the quality of such systems is critical, as incorrect answers could lead to significant harm. Current state-of-the-art testing approaches apply metamorphic relations to existing test datasets, generating test questions based on these relations. However, these methods have two key limitations. First, they often produce unnatural questions that humans are unlikely to ask, reducing the effectiveness of the generated questions in identifying bugs that might occur in real-world scenarios. Second, these questions are generated from pre-existing test datasets, ignoring the broader context and thus limiting the diversity and relevance of the generated questions.\n  In this work, we introduce CQ^2A, a context-driven question generation approach for testing question-answering systems. Specifically, CQ^2A extracts entities and relationships from the context to form ground truth answers, and utilizes large language models to generate questions based on these ground truth answers and the surrounding context.

This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy.

Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute.

To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews.

However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable. We conclude that robust methods, such as Propensity Score Matching, are essential for achieving valid causal inference from administrative data in the absence of randomization", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u9769\u65b0\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u75ab\u82d7\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f8b\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u9700\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u51fa\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6bd4\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u6e90\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u6742\u5065\u5eb7\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e0\u968f\u673a\u5316\u65f6\u9700\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator.

In review", "summary": "Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process.

The recent explosive development of LLM extends the family of SCMs,bringing LLMs for code that revolutionize development workflows. Investigating different kinds of SCM vulnerability is the cornerstone for the security and trustworthiness of AI-powered software ecosystems, however, the fundamental one, transferable vulnerability, remains critically underexplored. Existing studies neither offer practical ways, i.e. require access to the downstream classifier of SCMs, to produce effective adversarial samples for adversarial defense, nor give heed to the widely used LLM4Code in modern software development platforms and cloud-based integrated development environments. Therefore, this work systematically studies the intrinsic vulnerability transferability of both traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, and proposes a victim-agnostic approach to generate practical adversarial samples. We design HABITAT, consisting of a tailored perturbation-inserting mechanism and a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework that adaptively selects optimal perturbations without requiring any access to the downstream classifier of SCMs. Furthermore, an intrinsic transferability analysis of SCM vulnerabilities is conducted, revealing the potential vulnerability correlation between traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, together with fundamental factors that govern the success rate of victim-agnostic transfer attacks. These findings of SCM vulnerabilities underscore the critical focal points for developing robust defenses in the future. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our constructed adversarial examples crafted based on traditional SCMs achieve up to 64% success rates against LLM4Code, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 15%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u7edfSCMs\u548cLLM4Code\u5185\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9SCM\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6f0f\u6d1e\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5173\u6ce8LLM4Code\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1HABITAT\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u5236\u6270\u52a8\u63d2\u5165\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfSCMs\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5bf9LLM4Code\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe64%\uff0c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f15%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3002"}}

However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or \"dead\" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed.

The recent Armv9 architecture introduces Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), enabling tile-based matrix operations with high throughput.

To address this, we propose LOOPS, a hybrid execution framework that combines row-wise CSR-part with vector-wise BCSR-part layout, enabling cooperative utilization of vector instructions (NEON) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) resources. LOOPS supports multi-precision SpMM across FP64, FP32, and FP16 via an adaptive two-level parallelization scheme guided by a lightweight performance model. Experimental results on the entire SuiteSparse on an Apple's M4Pro CPU show that LOOPS achieves average speedups of 9.93$\\times$ (FP32)/14.4$\\times$ (FP64) against the CPU baseline TACO and 71.3$\\times$ (FP32)/54.8$\\times$ (FP64) with respect to Armadillo.

LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail.

An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning.

The standard approach trains sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on each layer's activations. However, SAEs trained in isolation don't encourage sparse cross-layer connections, inflating extracted circuits where upstream features needlessly affect multiple downstream features. Current evaluations focus on individual SAE performance, leaving interaction sparsity unexamined. We introduce SCALAR (Sparse Connectivity Assessment of Latent Activation Relationships), a benchmark measuring interaction sparsity between SAE features. We also propose \"Staircase SAEs\", using weight-sharing to limit upstream feature duplication across downstream features. Using SCALAR, we compare TopK SAEs, Jacobian SAEs (JSAEs), and Staircase SAEs. Staircase SAEs improve relative sparsity over TopK SAEs by $59.67\\% \\pm 1.83\\%$ (feedforward) and $63.15\\% \\pm 1.35\\%$ (transformer blocks). JSAEs provide $8.54\\% \\pm 0.38\\%$ improvement over TopK for feedforward layers but cannot train effectively across transformer blocks, unlike Staircase and TopK SAEs which work anywhere in the residual stream.

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes.

To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions.

Using the OR-Tools constraint solver, our experiments on small-to-mid-sized clusters indicate that, within a 1-second scheduling window, our approach places more higher-priority pods than the default scheduler (possibly demonstrating allocation optimality) in over 44\\% of realisable allocation scenarios where the default scheduler fails, while certifying that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\\% of scenarios. With a 10-second window, our approach improves placements in over 73\\% and still certifies that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\\% of scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7Pod\u5206\u914d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "Kubernetes\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u540e\u5907\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528OR - Tools\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u57281\u79d2\u8c03\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\uff0c\u572844%\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u653e\u7f6e\u66f4\u591a\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7Pod\uff1b10\u79d2\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\uff0c\u8d8573%\u573a\u666f\u6539\u5584\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5747\u6709\u8d8519%\u573a\u666f\u8bc1\u660e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5df2\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316Kubernetes\u4e2dPod\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

Tools like KLEE are commonly used because they can automatically detect bugs and create test cases. But one of KLEE's biggest issues is how slow it can get when programs have lots of branching paths-it often becomes too resource-heavy to run on large or complex code. In this project, we wanted to see if a large language model like GPT-4o could simulate the kinds of outputs that KLEE generates. The idea was to explore whether LLMs could one day replace parts of symbolic execution to save time and resources.\n  One specific goal was to have GPT-4o identify the most constrained path in a program, this is the execution path with the most symbolic conditions. These paths are especially important because they often represent edge cases that are harder to test and more likely to contain deep bugs. However, figuring this out usually requires fully running KLEE, which can be expensive. So, we tested whether GPT-4o could predict the KLEE outputs and the most complex path using a dataset of 100 C programs. Our results showed about 20% accuracy in generating KLEE-like outputs and identifying the most constrained path.

Heterogeneity is a fundamental problem for many real-world systems largely because it resists many concentration arguments. In this paper, we assume that each of the $N$ arms can have different model parameters. We show that, under a mild assumption of uniform ergodicity, a natural finite-horizon LP-update policy with randomized rounding, that was originally proposed for the homogeneous case, achieves an $O(\\log N\\sqrt{1/N})$ optimality gap in infinite time average reward problems for fully heterogeneous RMABs. In doing so, we show results that provide strong theoretical guarantees on a well-known algorithm that works very well in practice. The LP-update policy is a model predictive approach that computes a decision at time $t$ by planing over a time-horizon $\\{t\\dots t+\u03c4\\}$. Our simulation section demonstrates that our algorithm works extremely well even when $\u03c4$ is very small and set to $5$, which makes it computationally efficient. Our theoretical results draw on techniques from the model predictive control literature by invoking the concept of \\emph{dissipativity} and generalize quite easily to the more general weakly coupled heterogeneous Markov Decision Process setting. In addition, we draw a parallel between our own policy and the LP-index policy by showing that the LP-index policy corresponds to $\u03c4=1$.

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSoft - Partial Conservative Q - Learning (SPaCQL)\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\uff08PAR\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1SPaCQL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528PAR\u7f13\u89e3OOD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540cPAR\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u504f\u79bb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660eSPaCQL\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPaCQL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u6536\u96c6\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u662f\u5426\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6210\u672c\u907f\u514d\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

For instance, an $(O(n^2))$ versus $(O(n \\log n))$ sorting algorithm may yield similar output but incur vastly different performance costs in production. This discrepancy reveals a critical limitation in current evaluation methods: they fail to capture the behavioral and performance diversity among correct solutions. To address this, we introduce a principled framework for evaluating the dynamic stability of generated code. We propose two metrics derived from opcode distributions: Static Canonical Trace Divergence (SCTD), which captures algorithmic structure diversity across generated solutions, and Dynamic Canonical Trace Divergence (DCTD), which quantifies runtime behavioral variance. Their ratio, the Behavioral Expression Factor (BEF), serves as a diagnostic signal: it indicates critical runtime instability when BEF $\\ll$ 1 and functional redundancy when BEF $\\gg$ 1. Empirical results on BigOBench and CodeContests show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant algorithmic variance even among functionally correct outputs. Notably, increasing sampling temperature improves pass@1 rates but degrades stability, revealing an unrecognized trade-off: searching for correct solutions in diverse output spaces introduces a \"penalty of instability\" between correctness and behavioral consistency.

This work is part of the Zerovision project. Code available at: https://github.com/ertis-research/zerovision", "summary": "Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization.

In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets.

In this work, we propose a complementary perspective to utilize recent progress on \"neural network repair\" to mitigate these security threats and repair various kinds of neural network defects (arising from different security threats) within a unified framework, offering a potential silver bullet solution to real-world scenarios. To substantially push the boundary of existing repair techniques (suffering from limitations such as lack of guarantees, limited scalability, considerable overhead, etc) in addressing more practical contexts, we propose ProRepair, a novel provable neural network repair framework driven by formal preimage synthesis and property refinement. The key intuitions are: (i) synthesizing a precise proxy box to characterize the feature space preimage, which can derive a bounded distance term sufficient to guide the subsequent repair step towards the correct outputs, and (ii) performing property refinement to enable surgical corrections and scale to more complex tasks. We evaluate ProRepair across four security threats repair tasks on six benchmarks and the results demonstrate it outperforms existing methods in effectiveness, efficiency and scalability. For point-wise repair, ProRepair corrects models while preserving performance and achieving significantly improved generalization, with a speedup of 5x to 2000x over existing provable approaches. In region-wise repair, ProRepair successfully repairs all 36 safety property violation instances (compared to 8 by the best existing method), and can handle 18x higher dimensional spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProRepair\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u7f13\u89e3\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u6709\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u539f\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\u7684ProRepair\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5408\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cProRepair\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u70b9\u4fee\u590d\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ProRepair\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL.

In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling them to effectively address software security challenges such as vulnerability detection. However, systematic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of LLMs and LLM-based agents for security patch detection. Specifically, we investigate three methods: Plain LLM (a single LLM with a system prompt), Data-Aug LLM (data augmentation based on the Plain LLM), and the ReAct Agent (leveraging the thought-action-observation mechanism). We also evaluate the performance of both commercial and open-source LLMs under these methods and compare these results with those of existing baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the detection performance of these methods across various vulnerability types, and examine the impact of different prompting strategies and context window sizes on the results. Our findings reveal that the Data-Aug LLM achieves the best overall performance, whereas the ReAct Agent demonstrates the lowest false positive rate (FPR).

This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets.

During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence.

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies.

Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation.

Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance.

Many great products already have fine threat models, and turning those into PTMs is a relatively minor task, so we argue this should (and easily could) become the new norm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u516c\u5171\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PTM\uff09\u4f20\u9012\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u6280\u672f\u793e\u533a\u5171\u4eabPTM\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5171\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5411\u4ed6\u4eba\u4f20\u8fbe\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5217\u4e3e\u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u5148\u4f8b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6f5c\u5728\u5f02\u8bae\uff0c\u5f15\u7528\u76d1\u7ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9f13\u52b1\u6280\u672f\u793e\u533a\u5171\u4eabPTM\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time.

Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model.

However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy.

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSDE\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6TimeFlow\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTimeFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u968f\u673a\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeFlow\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The foreseen trend is that they will play an increasingly visible role in daily life, which will have to be backed by appropriate operational resources. For example, due to increasing demand, smart contracts could soon face a shortage of knowledgeable users and tools to handle them in practice. Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects. Because of a steep learning curve, the handling of smart contracts is currently performed by specialised developers mainly, and most of the research effort is focusing on smart contract security, while other aspects like usability being somewhat neglected. Specific tools would lower the entry barrier, enabling interested non-experts to create smart contracts.\n  In this paper we designed, developed and tested Blockly2Hooks, a solution towards filling this gap even in challenging scenarios such as when the smart contracts are written in an advanced language like C. With the XRP Ledger as a concrete working case, Blockly2Hooks helps interested non-experts from the community to learn smart contracts easily and adopt the technology, through leveraging well-proven teaching methodologies like Visual Programming Languages, and more specifically, the Blockly Visual Programming library from Google.

This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules.

Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts.

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684ST - SAM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u65b9\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5176\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u56e0\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u800c\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faST - SAM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u4ece\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u6349\u8fdc\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST - SAM\u5728RMSE\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\uff0c\u5728MAPE\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad817%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ST - SAM\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u71b5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u671f\u8fdb\u5165\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events.

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPath - Neighbor\u589e\u5f3aGNN (PN - GNN)\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ecf\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u5bf9KG\u4e2d\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPN - GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u90bb\u5c45\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76PN - GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0aPN - GNN\u6bd4C - GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c(k + 1)\u8df3\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u4f18\u4e8ek\u8df3\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePN - GNN\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PN - GNN\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728KG\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration.

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM).

This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials.

Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions.

This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d7\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u5c55\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e7f\u4e49\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u6838\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6e10\u8fd1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7f\u4e49\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy.

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TdRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTdRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd4\u56de\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepMind Control Suite\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTdRL\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "TdRL\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks.

However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6ce8\u5851\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u964d\u672c\u589e\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6269\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u6ce8\u5851\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u5165\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u529b\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks.

However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u6807\u79f0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8fc7\u6e21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6a21\u4eff\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u5b8c\u5168\u7528\u6807\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7528\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8bf7\u6c42\u662f\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9644\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u4e92\u8865\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u7acb\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3001\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u53d1\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u589e\u52a0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs.

In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction.

We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency.

We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u5341\u4e00\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5341\u4e00\u9879\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u56db\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76ee\u6807\u5b8c\u6210\u738788.8%\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u5176\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries.

To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors.

Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions.

The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously.

In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal.

Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5171\u8bc6\u4f46\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7406\u7531\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\u4e24\u7ec4\u4eba\u7fa4\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591aLLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6709\u5927\u81f4\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u4e3a\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u7ef4\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods.

In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue.

These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking.

To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph.

A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3Best-of-$N$\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "Best-of-$N$\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u8f93\u51fa\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u786e\u5b9a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u9ece\u66fc\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error.

The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy.

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLPPG - RL\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5904\u7406\u6709\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u53c2\u6216\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLPPG - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u786e\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u6b65\u9aa4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528Dykstra\u6295\u5f71\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u63a2\u7d22\u9632\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc72D\u5bfc\u822a\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLPPG - RL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fde\u7eedLMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LPPG - RL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}

While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance.

(i) Policy parsing: an ensemble of LLMs translates natural-language privacy policies into a structured privacy-policy model, where cross-LLM voting guarantees confidence of the parsing results.

(iii) Compliance auditing: ontology alignment and automata-based evaluation connect the policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checks between the natural-language policy and observed unordered data practices of AI agents. (iv) User interface: a platform-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy risks detected during auditing, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.\n  In addition to common formatted privacy policies, AudAgent also supports user-defined policies for fine-grained control and customization.

To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the \"win-win\" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation.

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \\textit{global stability}, \\textit{phase sensitivity}, and \\textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\\% in MSE and 5.15\\% in MAE.

Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment.

The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations.

However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network.

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08PINO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u679c\u597d\u4e14\u7701\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPINO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "PINO\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u957f\u6eda\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u768410\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "PINO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation.

We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \\emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \\emph{direct} and \\emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.\n  Furthermore, we establish a general \\emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure.

Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue. I analyze this behavior through the lenses of epistemic virtue theory, speech-act philosophy, and cognitive alignment, showing that RLHF produces agents trained to mimic epistemic confidence without access to epistemic justification. The polite liar thus reveals a deeper alignment tension between linguistic cooperation and epistemic integrity.

Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop.

Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction.

These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6KG - DF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfKG\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6KG - DF\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u95ee\u7b54\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "KG - DF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9632\u5fa1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants.

In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality.

However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption.

Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u9057\u4f20\u7a81\u53d8\u8c31\uff0c\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGPT\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9057\u4f20\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u9057\u4f20\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u9057\u4f20\u7a81\u53d8\u8c31\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Biologically - Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578bTransformer GPT\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684\u5408\u6210\u53d8\u5f02\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5e73\u5747\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GPT\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u5408\u6210\u53d8\u5f02\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities. To address these gaps, we propose Federated ReWeighting (FedRW), the first privacy-preserving framework, to the best of our knowledge, that performs soft deduplication via sample reweighting instead of deletion in federated LLM training, without assuming a trusted third party. At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees.

However, ensuring safe, fair, and reliable participation remains a persistent challenge. Traditional polling methods have seen a notable decline in engagement over recent decades, raising concerns about the credibility of collected data. Meanwhile, social and peer-to-peer networks have become increasingly widespread, but data from these platforms can suffer from credibility issues due to fraudulent or ineligible participation. In this paper, we explore how social interactions can help restore credibility in crowdsourced data collected over social networks. We present an empirical study to detect ineligible participation in a polling task through AI-based graph analysis of social interactions among imperfect participants composed of honest and dishonest actors. Our approach focuses solely on the structure of social interaction graphs, without relying on the content being shared. We simulate different levels and types of dishonest behavior among participants who attempt to propagate the task within their social networks. We conduct experiments on real-world social network datasets, using different eligibility criteria and modeling diverse participation patterns.

Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline.

The flow field exhibits highly unsteady dynamics, including complex shock-boundary layer interactions, shock oscillations, and the generation of Kutta waves from the trailing edge. A high-fidelity CFD solver, employing a fifth-order spectral discontinuous Galerkin scheme in space and a strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (5,4) method in time, together with adaptive mesh refinement capability, is used to obtain the accurate flow field. Synthetic jet actuation is employed to manipulate these unsteady flow features, while the DRL agent autonomously discovers effective control strategies through direct interaction with high-fidelity compressible flow simulations. The trained controllers effectively mitigate shock-induced separation, suppress unsteady oscillations, and manipulate aerodynamic forces under transonic conditions. In the first set of experiments, aimed at both drag reduction and lift enhancement, the DRL-based control reduces the average drag coefficient by 13.78% and increases lift by 131.18%, thereby improving the lift-to-drag ratio by 121.52%, which underscores its potential for managing complex flow dynamics. In the second set, targeting drag reduction while maintaining lift, the DRL-based control achieves a 25.62% reduction in drag and a substantial 196.30% increase in lift, accompanied by markedly diminished oscillations. In this case, the lift-to-drag ratio improves by 220.26%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4RAE2822\u7ffc\u578b\u5728Re = 50,000\u65f6\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u8de8\u97f3\u901f\u6fc0\u6ce2 - \u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d41\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u5bf9\u963b\u529b\u3001\u5347\u529b\u548c\u5347\u963b\u6bd4\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u8de8\u97f3\u901f\u6fc0\u6ce2 - \u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d41\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fCFD\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u6d41\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5c04\u6d41\u4f5c\u52a8\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u975e\u5b9a\u5e38\u6d41\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0cDRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ec4\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u657013.78%\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u5347\u529b131.18%\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5347\u963b\u6bd4121.52%\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ec4\u51cf\u5c11\u963b\u529b25.62%\u3001\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u5347\u529b196.30%\u3001\u5347\u963b\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad8220.26%\uff0c\u4e14\u632f\u8361\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "DRL-based\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Codes will be released later", "summary": "Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are increasingly used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality (VR). Point-based neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in point cloud analysis, originally targeting small-scale inputs. However, as PNNs evolve to process large-scale point clouds with hundreds of thousands of points, all-to-all computation and global memory access in point cloud processing introduce substantial overhead, causing $O(n^2)$ computational complexity and memory traffic where n is the number of points}. Existing accelerators, primarily optimized for small-scale workloads, overlook this challenge and scale poorly due to inefficient partitioning and non-parallel architectures. To address these issues, we propose FractalCloud, a fractal-inspired hardware architecture for efficient large-scale 3D point cloud processing. FractalCloud introduces two key optimizations: (1) a co-designed Fractal method for shape-aware and hardware-friendly partitioning, and (2) block-parallel point operations that decompose and parallelize all point operations. A dedicated hardware design with on-chip fractal and flexible parallelism further enables fully parallel processing within limited memory resources.

In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

These difficulties are greater for children than adults, yet most deep learning speech separation models for assistive devices are developed using adult voices in simplified, low-reverberation conditions. This overlooks both the higher spectral similarity of children's voices, which weakens separation cues, and the acoustic complexity of real classrooms. We address this gap using MIMO-TasNet, a compact, low-latency, multi-channel architecture suited for real-time deployment in bilateral hearing aids or cochlear implants. We simulated naturalistic classroom scenes with moving child-child and child-adult talker pairs under varying noise and distance conditions. Training strategies tested how well the model adapts to children's speech through spatial cues. Models trained on adult speech, classroom data, and finetuned variants were compared to assess data-efficient adaptation. Results show that adult-trained models perform well in clean scenes, but classroom-specific training greatly improves separation quality. Finetuning with only half the classroom data achieved comparable gains, confirming efficient transfer learning. Training with diffuse babble noise further enhanced robustness, and the model preserved spatial awareness while generalizing to unseen distances. These findings demonstrate that spatially aware architectures combined with targeted adaptation can improve speech accessibility for children in noisy classrooms, supporting future on-device assistive technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4f4e\u6df7\u54cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7528MIMO - TasNet\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u5ba4\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u5ba4\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u79bb\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5608\u6742\u6559\u5ba4\u4e2d\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u97f3\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u4f4e\u6df7\u54cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u5ba4\u58f0\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u542c\u529b\u969c\u788d\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIMO - TasNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7136\u6559\u5ba4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6559\u5ba4\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u4eba\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u6559\u5ba4\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u79bb\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u7528\u4e00\u534a\u6559\u5ba4\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7528\u6269\u6563\u5608\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5608\u6742\u6559\u5ba4\u4e2d\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8f85\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding.

The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state.

In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStreaming Tensor Program (STeP) \u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u52a8\u6001\u5f20\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7f16\u7a0b\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u5f20\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTeP\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7075\u6d3b\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u72b6\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868LLM\u5c42\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u94fa\u51cf\u5c112.18\u500d\u7247\u4e0a\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u63d0\u53471.5\u500d\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\u5206\u590d\u7528\u63d0\u53472.57\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "STeP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5f20\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

The adjustable hard settings of such systems require a flexible soft planning mechanism that enables realtime production planning and scheduling amid the existing complexity and variability in their configuration settings. This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization.

However, existing SNN-based SCR methods often struggle to capture rich temporal dependencies and contextual information from speech due to limited temporal modeling and binary spike-based representations. To address these challenges, we first introduce the multi-view spiking temporal-aware self-attention (MSTASA) module, which combines effective spiking temporal-aware attention with a multi-view learning framework to model complementary temporal dependencies in speech commands.

This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space.

Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement.

However, these statements are often vague and inconsistent, making manual review time-consuming and difficult to scale. While NLP offers a promising path forward, high-stakes compliance tasks require more than accurate classification: they demand transparent, rule-aligned outputs that legal experts can verify. Existing applications of large language models (LLMs) often reduce complex regulatory assessments to binary decisions, lacking the necessary structure for robust legal scrutiny. We argue that compliance verification is fundamentally a rule-matching problem: it requires evaluating whether textual statements adhere to well-defined regulatory rules. To this end, we propose a novel framework that harnesses AI for rule-level compliance verification while preserving expert oversight. At its core is the Compliance Alignment Judge (CA-Judge), which evaluates model-generated justifications based on their fidelity to statutory requirements. Using this feedback, we train the Compliance Alignment LLM (CALLM), a model that produces rule-consistent, human-verifiable outputs.

We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy.

To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm.

We investigate which modification is more natural, defining naturalness as proximity to the original Georgi-Glashow $SU(5)$ model. Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion. We then generalise these models by introducing a continuous parameter $y$, which takes the value 3 for the 45-dimensional field and 1.5 for the 24-dimensional field. Numerical optimisation reveals that $y \\approx 0.8$ yields the closest match to the original $SU(5)$ model, indicating that this value corresponds to the most natural model according to our definition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6SU(5)\u5927\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u542b24\u7ef4\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570y\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u53d1\u73b0y\u22480.8\u5bf9\u5e94\u6700\u81ea\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u539fGeorgi - Glashow\u7684SU(5)\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u8c31\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u54ea\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u4e3a\u4e0e\u539fGeorgi - Glashow SU(5)\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570y\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u542b24\u7ef4\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u793ay\u22480.8\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u539fSU(5)\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6839\u636e\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0cy\u22480.8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6700\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

DNN verifiers are complex tools, which might contain bugs that could compromise their soundness and undermine the reliability of the verification process. This concern can be mitigated using proofs: artifacts that are checkable by an external and reliable proof checker, and which attest to the correctness of the verification process. However, such proofs tend to be extremely large, limiting their use in many scenarios. In this work, we address this problem by minimizing proofs of unsatisfiability produced by DNN verifiers. We present algorithms that remove facts which were learned during the verification process, but which are unnecessary for the proof itself. Conceptually, our method analyzes the dependencies among facts used to deduce UNSAT, and removes facts that did not contribute. We then further minimize the proof by eliminating remaining unnecessary dependencies, using two alternative procedures. We implemented our algorithms on top of a proof producing DNN verifier, and evaluated them across several benchmarks.

Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits.

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for \"Semantic Error Propagation\" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output.

However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eFourier Neural Operator\u67b6\u6784\u548cU - Nets\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d852\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f90\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eFourier Neural Operator\u67b6\u6784\u4e0eU - Nets\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5438\u6536 - \u53d1\u5c04\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e09\u7ef4\u3001\u5355\u8272\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d852\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u64cd\u7eb5\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b14\u89e6\u5e76\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7b14\u89e6\u5d4c\u5165\u7075\u6d3b\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b14\u89e6\u7ea7\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002"}}

Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines.

This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications.

In bioacoustics, calibration is challenged by overlapping vocalisations, long-tailed species distributions, and distribution shifts between training and deployment data. The calibration of multi-label deep learning classifiers within the domain of bioacoustics has not yet been assessed. We systematically benchmark the calibration of four state-of-the-art multi-label bird sound classifiers on the BirdSet benchmark, evaluating both global, per-dataset and per-class calibration using threshold-free calibration metrics (ECE, MCS) alongside discrimination metrics (cmAP). Model calibration varies significantly across datasets and classes. While Perch v2 and ConvNeXt$_{BS}$ show better global calibration, results vary between datasets. Both models indicate consistent underconfidence, while AudioProtoPNet and BirdMAE are mostly overconfident. Surprisingly, calibration seems to be better for less frequent classes. Using simple post hoc calibration methods we demonstrate a straightforward way to improve calibration. A small labelled calibration set is sufficient to significantly improve calibration with Platt scaling, while global calibration parameters suffer from dataset variability. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and improving uncertainty calibration in bioacoustic classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66\u4e2d\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5728BirdSet\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6821\u51c6\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u7c7b\u9700\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u672a\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5728BirdSet\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9e1f\u7c7b\u58f0\u97f3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u9608\u503c\u6821\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5224\u522b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u540e\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u5584\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In speech synthesis, this is particularly pronounced due to the lack of a large-scale human preference dataset, which hinders the development of models that truly align with human perception. To address this, we introduce SpeechJudge, a comprehensive suite comprising a dataset, a benchmark, and a reward model centered on naturalness--one of the most fundamental subjective metrics for speech synthesis. First, we present SpeechJudge-Data, a large-scale human feedback corpus of 99K speech pairs. The dataset is constructed using a diverse set of advanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models across diverse speech styles and multiple languages, with human annotations for both intelligibility and naturalness preference. From this, we establish SpeechJudge-Eval, a challenging benchmark for speech naturalness judgment. Our evaluation reveals that existing metrics and AudioLLMs struggle with this task; the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves less than 70% agreement with human judgment, highlighting a significant gap for improvement. To bridge this gap, we develop SpeechJudge-GRM, a generative reward model (GRM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B. It is trained on SpeechJudge-Data via a two-stage post-training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought rationales followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO on challenging cases.

Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiffRegCD\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5bc6\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6CD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u4eff\u5c04\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u822a\u7a7a\u548c\u5730\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cDiffRegCD\u59cb\u7ec8\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis, which is critical for quantum computing, the chosen variable ordering governs the number of BDD nodes and thus the key metrics of resource consumption, such as Quantum Cost. Because finding an optimal variable ordering for BDDs is an NP-complete problem, existing heuristics often degrade as circuit complexity grows. We introduce BDD2Seq, a graph-to-sequence framework that couples a Graph Neural Network encoder with a Pointer-Network decoder and Diverse Beam Search to predict high-quality orderings. By treating the circuit netlist as a graph, BDD2Seq learns structural dependencies that conventional heuristics overlooked, yielding smaller BDDs and faster synthesis. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms.

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space.

In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration.

However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles.

Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair.

Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching.

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \\approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6570\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728Gset Max - Cut\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8aSA(2)\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8c\u6b21\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4f18\u5316\uff08QUBO\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u63a2\u7d22\u6307\u6570\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u94f8\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5229\u7528SA(2)\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u8fed\u4ee3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u62df\u5408\uff08IPF\uff09\u6b65\u9aa4\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5bf9\u6570\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08$2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\uff0c\u5728Gset Max - Cut\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u6df1\u5ea62 - 3\u7684\u7535\u8def\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u7387\uff08$r^* \\approx 0.99$\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u76f4\u63a5SA(2)\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8d4b\u4e88\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u4f53\u51f8\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u5fae\u6295\u5f71\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aSA(2)\u4f1a\u5bfc\u5411\u8c31\u51e0\u4f55\u3002"}}

Submitted to the LREC 2026 conference", "summary": "Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5357\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u8bed\u7cfb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7c7bBERT\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5357\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u8bed\u7cfb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7c7bBERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u5357\u65af\u62c9\u592b\u8bed\u7cfb\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7c7bBERT\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u84b8\u998f\uff08SCD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSCD\u6027\u80fd\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u7b54\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff08EPM\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u30013\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSCD\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff088B\uff09\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1GPT4\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u914d\u5907EPM\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow.

Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge.

The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness.

Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAdvRoad\u751f\u6210\u9053\u8def\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6d77\u62a5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89c6\u89c93D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6d77\u62a5\u6613\u88ab\u5bdf\u89c9\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u9053\u8def\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5173\u8054\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6d77\u62a5\u3002", "result": "AdvRoad\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "conclusion": "AdvRoad\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u9690\u853d\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies.

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection.

A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona.

Then employed a state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detection framework, leveraging a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. Comparative training rigorously evaluated a randomly initialized baseline model (Regimen 1) against a Transfer Learning Regimen (Regimen 2), initialized with weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset.

However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP.

These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries.

However, we often want policies (1) to be robust, i.e., they perform well on perturbations of the MDP and (2) to satisfy additional structural constraints regarding, e.g., their representation or implementation cost. Computing such robust and constrained policies is indeed computationally more challenging. This paper contributes the first approach to effectively compute robust policies subject to arbitrary structural constraints using a flexible and efficient framework. We achieve flexibility by allowing to express our constraints in a first-order theory over a set of MDPs, while the root for our efficiency lies in the tight integration of satisfiability solvers to handle the combinatorial nature of the problem and probabilistic model checking algorithms to handle the analysis of MDPs.

Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities.

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points.

Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models.

While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.

To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing.

However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness.

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling.

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues.

Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation.

Code is available at: https://github.com/wxszreal0/DiPVNet", "summary": "Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56de\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u56de\u590d\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56de\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods.

By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.\n  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.\n  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6a21\u62df\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6a21\u62df\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u5851MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u524d\u56db\u4e2aepoch\u8fbe\u523024.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u5c42\u4e14\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548NLP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths.

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues.

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer).

Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec.

The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer.

Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility.

In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models.
