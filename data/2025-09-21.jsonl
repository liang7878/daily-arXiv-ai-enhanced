The Pipeline is integrated\ninto the larger Stanford Spezi open-source ecosystem for developing research\nand translational digital health software systems.

Our analysis of existing\nsnapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed,\nare the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force\ncurrent systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture\ntoo much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance.\nFuthermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to\nreliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults.\n  To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine\npurpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with\nthe OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated\nprimitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result,\nSpice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing\nlatency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x\nover VM-based systems.

We argue that current\nperformance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,\nmechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the\nqualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from\nanalytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures\nand latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based\ndefinition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research\ncommunity."}

This raises an\nintriguing question: can coverage guided fuzzing (CGF), in particular\nframeworks like LibFuzzer, be effectively applied to DL libraries, and does it\noffer meaningful improvements in code coverage, bug detection, and scalability\ncompared to prior methods?\n  We present the first in-depth study to answer this question. A key challenge\nin applying CGF to DL libraries is the need to create a test harness for each\nAPI that can transform byte-level fuzzer inputs into valid API inputs. To\naddress this, we propose FlashFuzz, a technique that leverages Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to automatically synthesize API-level harnesses by combining\ntemplates, helper functions, and API documentation. FlashFuzz uses a feedback\ndriven strategy to iteratively synthesize and repair harnesses. With this\napproach, FlashFuzz synthesizes harnesses for 1,151 PyTorch and 662 TensorFlow\nAPIs. Compared to state-of-the-art fuzzing methods (ACETest, PathFinder, and\nTitanFuzz), FlashFuzz achieves up to 101.13 to 212.88 percent higher coverage\nand 1.0x to 5.4x higher validity rate, while also delivering 1x to 1182x\nspeedups in input generation. FlashFuzz has discovered 42 previously unknown\nbugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 8 of which are already fixed. Our study\nconfirms that CGF can be effectively applied to DL libraries and provides a\nstrong baseline for future testing approaches."}

In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules\non expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align\nmore statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural\ncorrespondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore,\nthey can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and\nrepair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors\neffectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++\ntranslations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental\nresults show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms\nof error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER\nexhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for\npatch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and\nleveraging coding knowledge from LLMs."}

However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the\nendogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure\naccurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)\nprovides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting\naccuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous\nvariables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage\nfuture exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal\nrelationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their\nperformance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous\nvariables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework\nDAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel\ndimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,\nwe first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal\ndiscovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future\nexogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module\nthat incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of\nforecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous\nvariables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar\ndesign principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical\nexogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal\ninjection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the\nprediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables."}

Due to the high\ncomputational cost and memory requirements associated with global optimization\nalgorithms, FWI is typically implemented using local optimization methods.\nHowever, when the initial velocity model is inaccurate and low-frequency\nseismic data (e.g., below 3 Hz) are absent, the mismatch between simulated and\nobserved data may exceed half a cycle, a phenomenon known as cycle skipping. In\nsuch cases, local optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based local\noptimizers) tend to converge to local minima, leading to inaccurate inversion\nresults. In machine learning, neural network training is also an optimization\nproblem prone to local minima. It often employs gradient-based optimizers with\na relatively large learning rate (beyond the theoretical limits of local\noptimization that are usually determined numerically by a line search), which\nallows the optimization to behave like a quasi-global optimizer. Consequently,\nafter training for several thousand iterations, we can obtain a neural network\nmodel with strong generative capability. In this study, we also employ\ngradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate for FWI.\nResults from both synthetic and field data experiments show that FWI may\ninitially converge to a local minimum; however, with sufficient additional\niterations, the inversion can gradually approach the global minimum, slowly\nfrom shallow subsurface to deep, ultimately yielding an accurate velocity\nmodel.

A key\nelement in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which\ncharacterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given\nspace. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using\ncontext information collected from the environment, such as scene images.\nHowever, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric\ninformation from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural\nimplicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural\nAcoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and\nextracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.\nOur approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features\ncan better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR\npredictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various\nevaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets\nwith limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound\nsimulation."}

Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution\nscenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of\n$2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks\nwith non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with\n$2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks\nin MMMU."}

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative\nto integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor\ntrajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.
