This paper\nintroduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional\nProof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,\ncontainerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential\nassessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail\nexecution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved\nextensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500\npotential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances\n(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through\nVulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and\nobserve a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model\nsuccessfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical\nweaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that\nmost unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and\npatches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies\nand multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall\neffectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent,\npractical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and\nunderscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect\nreal-world exploitation scenarios."}

To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA\nBayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART\nbased on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the\nvariability of a function into different interactions, each representing the\ncontribution of a different set of covariates or factors.

While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that\nunder certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which\nwe refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the\nstate-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal\nactions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)\nthe variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to\nzero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations\ncollapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed\nthose aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since\nthe collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise\nangles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:\ncan we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target\nconfiguration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that\nlearning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads\nto the AC.

We address the former by considering the Inner Product (mod 2) problem\n(instead of Set Disjointness) when the number of queries $m$ is\nsuper-polynomial (e.g., $2^{n^{1/3}}$), and the total update time is\n$m^{0.99}$. Our result for the latter also applies to cases with\nsuper-polynomial $m$."}

Traditional control systems, which are human\nand optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving\ncontext, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control\nstrategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning\nframework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture\nconsists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual\npower lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information\nwithin the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and\nenhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and\npotential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized\napproaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global\nobservations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level\nagent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment\nconstructed through the GNN.

The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:\nindividual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less\ndeployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first\nthree reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable\nvalue capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters).

We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method\nused for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to\nzeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order\noptimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to\ncorrect. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,\nZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.\nZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction\ntechniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource\nclients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp\neliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the\nserver and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the\nup-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various\ndatasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm\nthat can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with\na high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from\ntraining, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of\ndata, thus improving training outcomes."}

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the\nallocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn\nmovements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements.

To address these issues, we\npropose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the\nGCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical\nevaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by\nagents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior.

Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds.

FHE\noperations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse\nmatrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive.\nAdditionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical\nconcern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed\nSparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that\nefficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing\ncommunication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation\naccuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs,\neffectively preserving user privacy."}

During training,\nconverting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,\nquantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and\ncost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,\nand DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant\nconsistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near\nPareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical\nthroughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in\nvalidation accuracy."}

Our first\ncontribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear\nleast-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it\nusing a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is\nto feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the\nresultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third\ncontribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF\nquantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.\nPreliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain\nenhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much\nfewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for\naddressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing."}

For more information, please visit our\n  project website: https://strefer.github.io/", "summary": "Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to\nresolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.\nExisting Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of\ncoarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal\nreasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for\ntemporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object\nreferences and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.SY", "eess.SY", "stat.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}
