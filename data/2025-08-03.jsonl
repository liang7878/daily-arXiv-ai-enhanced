In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,\na high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix\nmultiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI\naccelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and\ncompensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed\nanalysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision\nloss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of\nmantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on\naccuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves\nnumerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.\nFinally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are\nintroduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to\nachieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend\n910A NPU lacking native FP32 support.

This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework\ndeveloped by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines\nrule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification\nfor comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.\n  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit\nand inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model\n(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of\nsynthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we\nemploy an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,\nextract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the\nNER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification\nprovides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation\nreliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage\nresidual risks.\n  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance\nacross benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and\nTCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty\nquantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical\nchallenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,\nand trustworthy release of imaging data for research."}

To address this deficiency, in\nthis paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard\nforecasting framework for agriculture.

Our results demonstrate strong predictive\naccuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's\ncapacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies.

We propose an optimization-based\nframework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it\nbidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio\n(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.\n  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models\ntowards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently\nsupport semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.\nExperimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that\nwhile optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually\nwith targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image\ncaptioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized\naudio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and\nincoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input\nfrom generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently\nlack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.\n  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,\nprimarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the\nstructure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work\nunderscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically\nrich and invertible multimodal latent spaces."}

Both parameters are learned using ensemble\ndisagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the\ndirection of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA\nto adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting\naggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training.

The\nbenchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for\nself-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby\nfocusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory\nenvironment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and\nsustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release\nTextQuests at https://textquests.ai."}

In this\nstudy, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function\nautonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We\nretrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic\nand board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth\nencounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan\nconsistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based\nadjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic\nand clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%\nof cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not\nsupported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI\nperformance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;\nthe diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this\nfirst large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong\ndiagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI\nperformance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.\nThese findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical\ndecision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare\nworkforce shortages."}

Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct\ntrajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable\nsignal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained\nself-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable\neffective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we\nintroduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation\nresults confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be\ninduced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection\nstructure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by\nintroducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the\ndual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm\ngeneration, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear\nfunctional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic\nengineering."}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability.

Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from\nthe original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream\naccuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and\nkey inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other\nnonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains\nunanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of\nsoftmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using\nthis form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows\nfor the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the\nimportance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps\nexplain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts."}

Using a single bounding box\nannotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D\nvolume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,\nbottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large\ncohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most\nconsistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not\ntrained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation\nperformance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation\nperformance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure\nmodes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2\ncan support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an\naccessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings."}

Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs\nand 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware\ndistribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted\nfilenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware\ncampaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering\ninfection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware\nanalysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,\nartifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research\npresents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early\nintervention."}
