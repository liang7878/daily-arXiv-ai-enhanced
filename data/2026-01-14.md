### [1] [Bridging the Trust Gap: Clinician-Validated Hybrid Explainable AI for Maternal Health Risk Assessment in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07866)
*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin,Suraiya Shabnam Bristy*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在资源受限环境下用于孕产妇健康风险预测时缺乏可解释性和信任的问题。

Method: 提出结合前验模糊逻辑和后验SHAP解释的混合可解释AI框架，在1014份孕产妇健康记录上开发fuzzy - XGBoost模型，开展含14名医护人员的验证研究。

Result: 模型准确率88.67%（ROC - AUC: 0.9703）；71.4%医护人员偏好混合解释，54.8%表示信任可用于临床；确定主要预测因素，验证临床知识整合；医生看重集成临床参数，指出关键缺口。

Conclusion: 结合可解释的模糊规则和特征重要性解释能提高实用性和信任度，为可解释AI在孕产妇医疗保健中的应用提供实用见解。

Abstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将可执行本体（EO）应用于游戏开发，实现从算法行为编程到语义世界建模的转变，解决游戏AI架构中的语义 - 过程差距。

Method: 以生存游戏场景（Winter Feast）为例，展示EO通过数据流条件实现基于优先级的任务中断，与BT和GOAP进行对比。

Result: 发现EO与BT和GOAP的根本区别在于，EO建模动作何时可行；还探讨了集成策略、调试优势和LLM驱动的运行时模型生成潜力。

Conclusion: EO应用于游戏开发具有范式转变的特点，能有效解决游戏AI架构中的语义 - 过程差距。

Abstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.

*Chenjie Hao,Weyl Lu,Yuko Ishiwaka,Zengyi Li,Weier Wan,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无训练方法，应用于视觉和语言模型，能使模型识别未知，通过模型校准等操作实现高效可靠AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何让模型识别自身未知情况，利用置信度反映模型无知。

Method: 提出简单、有效且通用的无训练方法，进行模型校准、级联和数据清洗，同时利用校准置信度的可比性。

Result: 实现模型级联提升效率且不损精度，设计数据清洗方法平衡精度和检测率，识别数据集中错误标注样本。

Conclusion: 使模型识别未知是迈向更高效、可靠、可信赖AI的实用步骤。

Abstract: When a model knows when it does not know, many possibilities emerge. The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大语言模型遵守安全原则且不拒绝良性请求存在挑战，OpenAI的审议对齐方法在开源大模型效果待研究。

Method: 系统评估显式安全代码和案例示范的影响，提出基于强化学习的案例增强审议对齐方法CADA。

Result: 引用显式代码不能一致提升无害性且降低有用性，案例增强的简单代码训练产生更稳健通用安全行为；CADA有效提升无害性、抗攻击能力和减少过度拒绝。

Conclusion: CADA是改进安全同时保持有用性、替代仅基于规则审议对齐的实用方法。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) adhere to safety principles without refusing benign requests remains a significant challenge. While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.

### [5] [Internal Deployment Gaps in AI Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08005)
*Joe Kwon,Stephen Casper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨2025年美欧前沿AI监管对内部部署系统的处理，指出监管存在三个漏洞，分析其成因并给出解决办法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI监管主要针对面向外部用户的系统，而企业内部部署高能力系统也有高风险，需研究现有监管对内部部署的处理。

Method: 研究美欧2025年前沿AI监管对内部部署的处理，识别监管漏洞，分析漏洞存在原因，探讨解决办法及权衡。

Result: 识别出三个监管漏洞，包括范围模糊、时间点合规评估不足、信息不对称；分析了漏洞持续存在的原因，涉及可衡量性、激励机制和信息获取的矛盾。

Conclusion: 了解这些模式有助于政策制定者审慎地对内部部署AI系统做出政策选择。

Abstract: Frontier AI regulations primarily focus on systems deployed to external users, where deployment is more visible and subject to outside scrutiny. However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出SCASED系统，结合自动考勤与面部情绪识别来监测课堂参与度，实验达89.5%情绪分类准确率，表明结合考勤与情绪分析可助力教学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高校智能教室技术侧重自动考勤，忽视学生情感和认知参与，限制教师实时调整教学策略。

Method: 构建基于物联网的SCASED系统，用树莓派相机和OpenCV进行人脸检测，微调MobileNetV2模型分类情绪，用会话机制管理考勤和情绪监测，通过云仪表盘可视化数据。

Result: 使用DAiSEE数据集实验，情绪分类准确率达89.5%。

Conclusion: 将考勤数据与情绪分析结合，能让教师深入了解课堂动态，支持更有针对性的教学实践。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of smart classroom technologies in higher education has mainly focused on automating attendance, with limited attention given to students' emotional and cognitive engagement during lectures. This limits instructors' ability to identify disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time. This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices.

Conclusion: 所提深度学习框架具可扩展性和有效性，能用于现代奶牛养殖可持续能源管理。

Abstract: Dairy farming is an energy intensive sector that relies heavily on grid electricity. With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共基准测试在文本到SQL技术比较和选择中依赖人工标注，标注有效性至关重要，需研究标注错误影响。

Method: 对BIRD和Spider 2.0 - Snow两个基准测试标注错误率进行基准测试，纠正BIRD开发集子集，重新评估16个开源代理的性能和排名。

Result: BIRD Mini - Dev和Spider 2.0 - Snow错误率分别为52.8%和62.8%；性能变化在-7%到31%，排名变化在-9到+9；未修正子集排名与完整开发集强相关，与修正子集弱相关。

Conclusion: 标注错误会显著扭曲报告的性能和排名，可能误导研究方向或部署选择。

Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

Abstract: Forward reachability analysis is the predominant approach for verifying reach-avoid properties in neural feedback systems (dynamical systems controlled by neural networks). This dominance stems from the limited scalability of existing backward reachability methods. In this work, we introduce new algorithms that compute both over- and under-approximations of backward reachable sets for such systems. We further integrate these backward algorithms with established forward analysis techniques to yield a unified verification framework for neural feedback systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 负约束是大语言模型指令遵循能力的基本测试，但失效情况常发生且原因不明，故开展全面机制研究。

Method: 引入语义压力衡量生成禁止词的概率；用logit lens技术进行逐层分析；通过激活补丁确定关键层。

Result: 违规概率与语义压力呈紧密逻辑关系；负指令在失效时抑制信号弱；存在两种失效模式并分析了占比和原因；确定23 - 27层对约束效果有因果影响。

Abstract: Negative constraints (instructions of the form "do not use word X") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=σ(-2.40+2.27\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强代理框架的复杂推理会导致推理痕迹和工具工件积累，破坏逻辑连续性，需要内存机制来支持长时连贯推理。

Method: 提出MemoBrain执行内存模型，构建依赖感知内存，组织推理进度，管理工作上下文，包括修剪无效步骤、折叠完成的子轨迹等。

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalker和BrowseComp - Plus等长时基准测试中，MemoBrain相比强基线有持续改进。

Conclusion: MemoBrain能对推理轨迹进行明确认知控制，而非被动积累上下文，有效解决长时推理问题。

Abstract: Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.
  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.
  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MIRRORBENCH基准框架评估用户代理生成类人用户话语的能力，开源且有简单CLI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有“act - as - a - user”提示生成的话语冗长不真实，需对用户代理进行原则性评估。

Method: 构建MIRRORBENCH框架，有模块化执行引擎等特性，支持多种组件，包含多种评估指标。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上得到方差感知结果，揭示用户代理和真实人类用户存在系统性差距。

Conclusion: MIRRORBENCH可有效评估用户代理生成类人话语的能力，框架开源可访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as human simulators, both for evaluating conversational systems and for generating fine-tuning data. However, naive "act-as-a-user" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports. The framework can be accessed at https://github.com/SAP/mirrorbench.

Conclusion: 新的轨迹预测框架有效，且具有可迁移性。

Abstract: When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.

Abstract: Computational resource constraints on edge devices make it difficult to develop a fully embedded AI companion system with a satisfactory user experience. AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions. This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities. In our experiments, we found that our system (using a very weak model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4) outperforms the equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window.

Synapse employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture in which a central Resolution Supervisor agent performs strategic task decomposition and delegates subtasks to specialized worker agents responsible for tactical execution. The system is orchestrated using LangGraph to manage complex and cyclical workflows. To validate the framework, a benchmark dataset of 30 complex disruption scenarios was curated from a qualitative analysis of over 6,000 real-world user reviews. System performance is evaluated using an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol with explicit bias mitigation.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决现有方法问题，可在动态嵌入式系统中实际部署。

Abstract: Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and task-to-core allocation are critical for thermal management and balancing energy and performance in embedded systems. Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor. First-decision latency is 8,300x faster than table-based profiling, enabling practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型处理文本属性图的方法受上下文窗口限制，随机采样引入噪声，影响推理稳定性，需有效利用图的结构和语义信息。

Method: 提出Homophily - aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C)框架，结构上基于结构熵最小化原则进行全局分层分区，语义上基于检测到的结构同质性进行差异化语义聚合。

Result: 在10个节点级基准测试中，HS2C提高压缩率和下游推理准确率；在7个图级基准测试中，验证其任务通用性。

Conclusion: HS2C通过为大型语言模型提供结构和语义压缩后的输入，具有优越性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.

Conclusion: 与既定原则一致的解释评估能突出Rashomon集合内模型行为差异，帮助选择模型，AXE在评估中有优势。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is concerned with producing explanations indicating the inner workings of models. For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper "Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method "AXE" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.

Conclusion: 每局补偿分机制更适合线上玩家，这是利用AI评估麻将平衡性并改进传统游戏以适应线上玩家的初步尝试。

Abstract: As one of the worldwide spread traditional game, Official International Mahjong can be played and promoted online through remote devices instead of requiring face-to-face interaction. However, online players have fragmented playtime and unfixed combination of opponents in contrary to offline players who have fixed opponents for multiple rounds of play. Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players. This work is an initial attempt to use data from AI systems to evaluate Official Internatinoal Mahjong's game balance and develop a revised version of the traditional game better adapted for online players.

Conclusion: 类别形成、层次组织、无监督学习和高级认知活动可理解为E3最小化下的格式塔完成实例。

Abstract: General intelligence must reorganize experience into internal structures that enable prediction and action under finite resources. Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization.

Method: 引入MPCI - Bench，其由相同视觉源的正负实例对组成，分三个层级，并通过三原则迭代细化流程确保数据质量。

Result: 对最先进的多模态模型的评估显示，它们在平衡隐私和效用方面存在系统性失败，且存在明显的模态泄漏差距，视觉敏感信息比文本信息泄漏更频繁。

Conclusion: 将开源MPCI - Bench以促进代理CI的未来研究。

Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.

Conclusion: 提出协调应源于共享语义表示而非显式设计的数值信号的研究方向。

Abstract: Reward engineering, the manual specification of reward functions to induce desired agent behavior, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \textbf{LPR} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{P}rogram \textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \textbf{\textsc{\MethodName{}}} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{S}olution \textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.

Conclusion: T3基准能有效捕捉结构化验证下决定性因果判断的恢复情况

Abstract: We introduce T3 (Testing Trustworthy Thinking), a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality. Comprising 454 expert-curated vignettes, T3 prioritizes high-resolution failure analysis, decomposing performance into Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal on underdetermined cases. By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a "Skepticism Trap" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination. Finally, we use the benchmark to validate a process-verified protocol (RCA), showing that T3 successfully captures the restoration of decisive causal judgment under structured verification.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction. It forms the basis of sign language for the visually impaired people. This work proposes a novel hand gesture recognizing system for the differently-abled persons. The model uses a convolutional neural network, known as VGG-16 net, for building a trained model on a widely used image dataset by employing Python and Keras libraries. Furthermore, the result is validated by the NUS dataset, consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures, fed to the model as the validation set. Afterwards, a testing dataset of 10 classes is built by employing Google's open source Application Programming Interface (API) that captures different gestures of human hand and the efficacy is then measured by carrying out experiments. The experimental results show that by combining a transfer learning mechanism together with the image data augmentation, the VGG-16 net produced around 98% accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出SAC框架研究工具增强大语言模型系统控制机制，有理论结果并考虑多种扩展情况。

Abstract: Tool-augmented LLM systems expose a control regime that learning theory has largely ignored: sequential decision-making with a massive discrete action universe (tools, APIs, documents) in which only a small, unknown subset is relevant for any fixed task distribution. We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC.

Abstract: With the rise of the Agent Web and Model Context Protocol (MCP), the agent ecosystem is evolving into an open collaborative network, exponentially increasing accessible tools. However, current architectures face severe scalability and generality bottlenecks. To address this, we propose ToolACE-MCP, a pipeline for training history-aware routers to empower precise navigation in large-scale ecosystems. By leveraging a dependency-rich candidate Graph to synthesize multi-turn trajectories, we effectively train routers with dynamic context understanding to create the plug-and-play Light Routing Agent. Experiments on the real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark demonstrate superior performance. Notably, ToolACE-MCP exhibits critical properties for the future Agent Web: it not only generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation but also maintains exceptional robustness against noise and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces. These findings provide a strong empirical foundation for universal orchestration in open-ended ecosystems.

Result: 在标准假设下，贪婪算法能高概率准确恢复相关动作集，给出参数估计误差保证，决策规则对新潜在状态接近最优，建立信息论下界。

Conclusion: 稀疏动作发现是大动作决策的基本原理，为智能体系统的动作剪枝提供理论基础。

Abstract: Modern agentic systems operate in environments with extremely large action spaces, such as tool-augmented language models with thousands of available APIs or retrieval operations. Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.
  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.
  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文单口喜剧生成有文化幽默、时机把握等挑战，且常用数据集与长单口喜剧生成任务不匹配。

Method: 构建基于AutoGen的端到端多智能体系统OpenMic，多轮迭代规划，采用检索增强生成，微调JokeWriter。

Result: 可将用户生活主题转化为3 - 5分钟中文单口喜剧表演并生成旁白喜剧视频。

Conclusion: 提出的OpenMic系统能有效应对中文单口喜剧生成的挑战。

Abstract: Chinese stand-up comedy generation goes beyond plain text generation, requiring culturally grounded humor, precise timing, stage-performance cues, and implicit multi-step reasoning. Moreover, commonly used Chinese humor datasets are often better suited for humor understanding and evaluation than for long-form stand-up generation, making direct supervision misaligned with the target task. To address these challenges, we present OpenMic, an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms a user-provided life topic into a 3-5 minute Chinese stand-up performance and further produces a narrated comedy video. OpenMic orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a multi-round iterative loop-planning to jointly optimize humor, timing, and performability. To mitigate the dataset-task mismatch, we augment generation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for material grounding and idea expansion, and we fine-tune a dedicated JokeWriter to better internalize stand-up-specific setup-punchline structures and long-range callbacks.

Conclusion: 基于学习的公式使代理能够发现结构化、与任务对齐的内存管理策略，相比预定义例程具有关键优势。

Abstract: Equipping agents with memory is essential for solving real-world long-horizon problems. However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.

Result: 得出必然自我许可定理，即标准架构假设下循环认知辩护不可消除。

Conclusion: 常见的扩展、模型改进和以大语言模型为评判的方案无法消除类型层面存在的问题。

Abstract: LLM-based agent architectures systematically conflate information transport mechanisms with epistemic justification mechanisms. We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.

Conclusion: 稀疏性从训练早期就促进了内在稳定和分布式的计算骨干，有助于弥合稀疏架构和训练时可解释性的差距。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decouple model capacity from per-token computation, enabling scaling beyond the computational limits imposed by dense scaling laws. Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.

Conclusion: 为研究人工智能系统中创造力这一涌现现象提供了技术框架，而非事后评估标签。

Abstract: Creativity in artificial intelligence is most often addressed through evaluative frameworks that aim to measure novelty, diversity, or usefulness in generated outputs. While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.

TL;DR: 提出Owen - Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO)框架用于个性化推荐任务，在数据集上表现优于基线且有测试时鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法如GRPO依赖稀疏、序列级奖励，存在信用分配差距，尤其在模型需从无真实标签的不明确语言中推断潜在用户意图时问题突出。

Method: 引入OSPO框架，基于令牌对结果的边际贡献重新分配序列级优势，通过Shapley - Owen归因进行基于势的奖励塑造，直接从任务反馈中学习而无需参数化价值模型，通过形成语义连贯单元联盟确定驱动性能的响应部分。

Result: 在Amazon ESCI和H&M Fashion数据集上实验显示，比基线有持续增益，且在测试时有对训练中未见的分布外检索器的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OSPO框架有效解决了信用分配差距问题，在个性化推荐任务中表现良好且有较强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.

Abstract: With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven substantial progress in reasoning-intensive domains like mathematics. However, optimizing open-ended generation remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. While rubric-based evaluation offers a structured proxy for verification, existing methods suffer from scalability bottlenecks and coarse criteria, resulting in a supervision ceiling effect. To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework. By synergizing principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution, our approach produces comprehensive and highly discriminative criteria capable of capturing the subtle nuances. Based on this framework, we introduce RubricHub, a large-scale ($\sim$110k) and multi-domain dataset. We validate its utility through a two-stage post-training pipeline comprising Rubric-based Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RuFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RuRL). Experimental results demonstrate that RubricHub unlocks significant performance gains: our post-trained Qwen3-14B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on HealthBench (69.3), surpassing proprietary frontier models such as GPT-5. The code and data will be released soon.

Abstract: Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \textit{reference-free} method that learns \textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation. The associated code and data are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/YaPO}.

Conclusion: TABGR 在表格推理任务上表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Table reasoning, a task to answer questions by reasoning over data presented in tables, is an important topic due to the prevalence of knowledge stored in tabular formats. Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Digital platforms have an ever-expanding user base, and act as a hub for communication, business, and connectivity. However, this has also allowed for the spread of hate speech and misogyny. Artificial intelligence models have emerged as an effective solution for countering online hate speech but are under explored for low resource and code-mixed languages and suffer from a lack of interpretability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space. The system has been evaluated using human evaluators who provided their responses on Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to determine overall usability.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型代理基准常强调单一能力维度或仅依赖行为结果，忽略决策推理和交流互动的过程信息，需系统评估其社会行为。

Method: 提出M3 - Bench多阶段基准和过程感知评估框架，含BTA、RPA、CCA三个模块，整合大五人格模型和社会交换理论形成社会行为画像。

Result: M3 - Bench能可靠区分不同模型的社会行为能力，发现部分模型行为结果合理但推理和沟通有明显不一致。

Conclusion: M3 - Bench可用于评估大语言模型代理的社会行为能力，超越简单任务得分和基于结果的指标。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents continue to advance, their advanced social behaviors, such as cooperation, deception, and collusion, call for systematic evaluation. However, existing benchmarks often emphasize a single capability dimension or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, overlooking rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.

TL;DR: 提出多模态预测基准What If TSF (WIT) 用于评估模型能否根据上下文文本进行预测，基准代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法多为单模态且依赖历史模式，现有基准无法明确模型是否有效利用文本输入，而人类专家会结合假设情景与历史证据进行预测。

Method: 引入多模态预测基准WIT，提供专家构建的合理或反事实情景。

Result: 构建了可用于情景引导多模态预测的严格测试平台。

Conclusion: WIT基准可用于评估模型基于上下文文本尤其是未来情景进行预测的能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical to real-world decision making, yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and rely on extrapolating historical patterns. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks largely provide retrospective or misaligned raw context, making it unclear whether such models meaningfully leverage textual inputs. In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios. By providing expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios, WIT offers a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/jinkwan1115/WhatIfTSF.

Abstract: Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.

Abstract: Sustainable water resource management in transboundary river basins is challenged by fragmented data, limited real-time access, and the complexity of integrating diverse information sources. This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts. The study demonstrates the potential of this AI assistant to support informed, timely decision-making and strengthen water security in complex river basins.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://hf.co/vidore.

Abstract: The launch of \$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \$500,000 across these projects.

Abstract: Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成存在权衡问题，串联文档推理有预填充瓶颈，单独编码文档KV缓存无跨文档交互。

Method: 提出Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced)，将证据聚合从注意力机制转移到解码，将检索文档视为孤立“专家”，通过检索感知对比解码规则同步预测。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需构建跨文档共享注意力即可恢复跨文档推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents.

Conclusion: 通用人工智能主要风险是作为人类智能放大器，对齐失败是结构性问题，需综合治理。

Abstract: Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.

Abstract: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are essential for evaluating corporate sustainability and ethical performance. However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.

Motivation: 用户期望大语言模型符合偏好，但个性化信息可能影响客观性和事实正确性，需要解决该问题。

Method: 先使用SFT训练PersonaDual学习两种推理模式，再通过提出的DualGRPO进行强化学习优化模式选择。

Result: 在客观和个性化基准测试中，PersonaDual保留个性化好处，减少干扰，实现近无干扰性能，更好利用个性化信号解决客观问题。

Conclusion: PersonaDual框架有效，能在个性化和客观性间取得较好平衡。

Abstract: As users increasingly expect LLMs to align with their preferences, personalized information becomes valuable. However, personalized information can be a double-edged sword: it can improve interaction but may compromise objectivity and factual correctness, especially when it is misaligned with the question. To alleviate this problem, we propose PersonaDual, a framework that supports both general-purpose objective reasoning and personalized reasoning in a single model, and adaptively switches modes based on context. PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection. Experiments on objective and personalized benchmarks show that PersonaDual preserves the benefits of personalization while reducing interference, achieving near interference-free performance and better leveraging helpful personalized signals to improve objective problem-solving.

Abstract: Women are twice as likely as men to face online harassment due to their gender. Despite recent advances in multimodal content moderation, most approaches still overlook the social dynamics behind this phenomenon, where perpetrators reinforce prejudices and group identity within like-minded communities. Graph-based methods offer a promising way to capture such interactions, yet existing solutions remain limited by heuristic graph construction, shallow modality fusion, and instance-level reasoning. In this work, we present MemeWeaver, an end-to-end trainable multimodal framework for detecting sexism and misogyny through a novel inter-meme graph reasoning mechanism. We systematically evaluate multiple visual--textual fusion strategies and show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the MAMI and EXIST benchmarks, while achieving faster training convergence. Further analyses reveal that the learned graph structure captures semantically meaningful patterns, offering valuable insights into the relational nature of online hate.

Abstract: Conversational AI is starting to support real clinical work, but most evaluation methods miss how compliance depends on the full course of a conversation. We introduce Obligatory-Information Phase Structured Compliance Evaluation (OIP-SCE), an evaluation method that checks whether every required clinical obligation is met, in the right order, with clear evidence for clinicians to review. This makes complex rules practical and auditable, helping close the gap between technical progress and what healthcare actually needs. We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps. By giving clinicians control over what to check and engineers a clear specification to implement, OIP-SCE provides a single, auditable evaluation surface that aligns AI capability with clinical workflow and supports routine, safe use.

Result: Cago在一系列稀疏奖励、目标条件任务中显著提高样本效率和最终性能，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Cago能有效解决模仿学习在长视野环境中的问题。

Abstract: Despite its promise, imitation learning often fails in long-horizon environments where perfect replication of demonstrations is unrealistic and small errors can accumulate catastrophically. We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.

Conclusion: 长期来看，AI可能不只是关乎“智能”，如同社交媒体不只是社交连接。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are predominantly designed, evaluated, and marketed as intelligent systems which will benefit society by augmenting or automating human cognitive labor, promising to increase personal, corporate, and macroeconomic productivity. But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose "thick entertainment" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about "intelligence" as social media is about social connection.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in digital platforms and decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.

### [63] [Efficient Parameter Calibration of Numerical Weather Prediction Models via Evolutionary Sequential Transfer Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08663)
*Heping Fang,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 现有数值天气预报模型参数校准方法效率低，本文提出SEETO算法，实验表明其效率高，为参数校准提供新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数校准方法将每个校准任务视为独立优化问题，存在计算成本高、效率低的问题。

Method: 提出SEETO算法，引入气象状态表示提取器测量任务相似性，设计两级自适应知识迁移机制，包括重用历史任务种群和构建集成代理模型。

Result: 在10个不同校准任务实验中，在20次昂贵评估预算下，SEETO的超体积比两个基线平均提高6%，对比算法需更多评估次数才能达到此性能。

Conclusion: SEETO算法为数值天气预报模型参数的高效准确自动校准提供了新范式。

Abstract: The configuration of physical parameterization schemes in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of the forecast. However, existing parameter calibration methods typically treat each calibration task as an isolated optimization problem. This approach suffers from prohibitive computational costs and necessitates performing iterative searches from scratch for each task, leading to low efficiency in sequential calibration scenarios. To address this issue, we propose the SEquential Evolutionary Transfer Optimization (SEETO) algorithm driven by the representations of the meteorological state. First, to accurately measure the physical similarity between calibration tasks, a meteorological state representation extractor is introduced to map high-dimensional meteorological fields into latent representations. Second, given the similarity in the latent space, a bi-level adaptive knowledge transfer mechanism is designed. At the solution level, superior populations from similar historical tasks are reused to achieve a "warm start" for optimization. At the model level, an ensemble surrogate model based on source task data is constructed to assist the search, employing an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically balance the contributions of source domain knowledge and target domain data. Extensive experiments across 10 distinct calibration tasks, which span varying source-target similarities, highlight SEETO's superior efficiency. Under a strict budget of 20 expensive evaluations, SEETO achieves a 6% average improvement in Hypervolume (HV) over two state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, to match SEETO's performance at this stage, the comparison algorithms would require an average of 64% and 28% additional evaluations, respectively. This presents a new paradigm for the efficient and accurate automated calibration of NWP model parameters.

### [64] [CSQL: Mapping Documents into Causal Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08109)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

TL;DR: 介绍了新系统CSQL，能将非结构化文本转换为可SQL查询的因果数据库，支持因果分析，可处理大规模语料，应用广泛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可对文档集合进行因果分析、回答“为什么”问题的系统。

Method: 基于早期系统DEMOCRITUS，将文档转换为本地因果模型，区别于RAG和知识图谱方法。

Result: CSQL能支持单文档和大规模语料的因果查询，如处理TCC数据集。

Conclusion: CSQL可作为非结构化文档到因果数据库的编译器，有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We describe a novel system, CSQL, which automatically converts a collection of unstructured text documents into an SQL-queryable causal database (CDB). A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer "why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: "What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or "Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU方案吞吐量低，GPU系统动态更新和内存有限，存在性能差距。

Method: 采用分层向量索引架构进行CPU - GPU协同处理，使用工作负载感知的向量缓存机制，结合CUDA多流优化和自适应资源管理，以及并发控制。

Result: 在查询延迟和吞吐量上有显著提升，平均吞吐量高20.9倍，延迟降低1.3 - 50.7倍，大规模数据集保持高召回率。

Conclusion: SVFusion能有效解决实时向量搜索问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) underpins modern applications such as information retrieval and recommendation. With the rapid growth of vector data, efficient indexing for real-time vector search has become rudimentary. Existing CPU-based solutions support updates but suffer from low throughput, while GPU-accelerated systems deliver high performance but face challenges with dynamic updates and limited GPU memory, resulting in a critical performance gap for continuous, large-scale vector search requiring both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates. SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates. Empirical results demonstrate that SVFusion achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput, exhibiting a 20.9x higher throughput on average and 1.3x to 50.7x lower latency compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high recall for large-scale datasets under various streaming workloads.

Conclusion: 通过多目标优化和 ParetoPipe 框架，能有效解决资源受限边缘设备上 DNN 部署时平衡延迟和吞吐量的问题。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by reframing DNN partitioning as a multi-objective optimization problem. We argue that in real-world scenarios, a complex trade-off between latency and throughput exists, which is further complicated by network variability. To address this, we introduce ParetoPipe, an open-source framework that leverages Pareto front analysis to systematically identify optimal partitioning strategies that balance these competing objectives.
  Our contributions are threefold: we benchmark pipeline partitioned inference on a heterogeneous testbed of Raspberry Pis and a GPU-equipped edge server; we identify Pareto-optimal points to analyze the latency-throughput trade-off under varying network conditions; and we release a flexible, open-source framework to facilitate distributed inference and benchmarking. This toolchain features dual communication backends, PyTorch RPC and a custom lightweight implementation, to minimize overhead and support broad experimentation.

TL;DR: 提出适用于MXUs的对称线性求解器，在H200和MI300X上加速对称正定系统求解，有显著性能提升和精度保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速对称线性求解核心计算，满足科学和工程应用需求。

Method: 采用嵌套递归公式，引入自定义递归数据结构，用Julia实现，结合高层接口和底层库。

Result: 在H200上，递归FP64 SYRK比cuBLAS快14倍，混合精度SYRK和TRSM分别有27倍和5倍加速，Cholesky整体快5倍，精度比纯FP16好100倍。MI300X有类似表现。

Conclusion: 该求解器具有广泛适用性，能在不同GPU上高效加速对称线性求解。

Abstract: Symmetric linear solves are fundamental to a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, from climate modeling and structural analysis to machine learning and optimization. These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup. Comparable performance and accuracy trends are observed on MI300X, demonstrating broad applicability across GPUs.

Motivation: 传统多核CPU上PIC模拟的粒子 - 网格交互存在细粒度原子更新瓶颈，新CPU架构MPU提供克服机会。

Method: 提出MatrixPIC，包括沉积算法的块矩阵公式、混合执行流水线和增量排序器，适配MPU - VPU混合模型。

Result: 在HPC平台上有显著性能提升，LWFA模拟总运行时间最高达2.63倍加速，三阶沉积核心内核加速比最佳。

Conclusion: 面向矩阵的协同设计对新兴CPU架构加速PIC模拟有效。

Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations spend most of their execution time on particle--grid interactions, where fine-grained atomic updates become a major bottleneck on traditional many-core CPUs. Recent CPU architectures integrate specialized Matrix Processing Units (MPUs) that efficiently support matrix outer-product operations, offering new opportunities to overcome this limitation. Leveraging this architectural shift, this work focuses on redesigning the current deposition step of PIC simulations under a matrix-centric execution model.
  We present MatrixPIC, the first holistic co-design of the deposition kernel, data layout, and incremental particle sorting tailored to the hybrid MPU--VPU SIMD model on modern CPUs. MatrixPIC introduces: (i)~a block-matrix formulation of the current deposition algorithm that maps naturally to MPU outer-product primitives; (ii)~a hybrid execution pipeline that combines MPU-based high-density accumulation with VPU-based data preparation and control flow; and (iii)~an $O(1)$-amortized incremental sorter based on a gapped packed-memory array to preserve data locality for efficient MPU execution.
  Evaluated on a next-generation HPC platform, MatrixPIC achieves significant performance gains. In Laser-Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) simulations, it delivers up to $2.63\times$ speedup in total runtime. For third-order deposition, the core kernel is accelerated by $8.7\times$ over the baseline and $2.0\times$ over the best hand-optimized VPU implementation. Moreover, MatrixPIC reaches $83.08\%$ of theoretical CPU peak performance, nearly $2.8\times$ higher than a highly optimized CUDA kernel on a data center GPU. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of matrix-oriented co-design for accelerating PIC simulations on emerging CPU architectures.

Conclusion: 为在主流CPU硬件上进行大规模高阶弹性模拟提供了经过验证且高效的实用途径。

Abstract: In high-order finite element analysis for elasticity, matrix-free (PA) methods are a key technology for overcoming the memory bottleneck of traditional Full Assembly (FA). However, existing implementations fail to fully exploit the special structure of modern CPU architectures and tensor-product elements, causing their performance "sweet spot" to anomalously remain at the low order of $p \approx 2$, which severely limits the potential of high-order methods. To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. Our multi-level optimization strategy includes replacing the original $O(p^6)$ generic algorithm with an efficient $O(p^4)$ one based on tensor factorization, exploiting Voigt symmetry to reduce redundant computations for the elasticity problem, and employing macro-kernel fusion to enhance data locality and break the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance "sweet spot" to the higher-order region of $p \ge 6$. Compared to the MFEM baseline, the optimized core operator (kernel) achieves speedups of 7x to 83x, which translates to a 3.6x to 16.8x end-to-end performance improvement in the complete solution process. This paper provides a validated and efficient practical path for conducting large-scale, high-order elasticity simulations on mainstream CPU hardware.

Method: 先评估不同并行策略通信开销，自动选最优策略；提出基于融合AR - A2A通信算法的TP - EP混合并行，重叠节点内AR和节点间A2A通信。

Result: 在DeepSeek - R1和Qwen3模型实验中，TTFT加速1.08 - 3.80倍，ITL加速1.03 - 1.66倍，吞吐量提升5.2% - 50.3%。

Conclusion: MixServe系统能高效部署MoE模型，取得优于现有方法的推理性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are emerging as the latest paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.
  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Let F be a finite family of graphs. In the F-Deletion problem, one is given a graph G and an integer k, and the goal is to find k vertices whose deletion results in a graph with no minor from the family F. This may be regarded as a far-reaching generalization of Vertex Cover and Feedback vertex Set. In their seminal work, Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra & Saurabh [FOCS 2012] gave a polynomial kernel for this problem when the family F contains a planar graph. As the size of their kernel is g(F) * k^{f(F)}, a natural follow-up question was whether the dependence on F in the exponent of k can be avoided. The answer turned out to be negative: Giannapoulou, Jansen, Lokshtanov & Saurabh [TALG 2017] proved that this is already inevitable for the special case of the Treewidth-d-Deletion problem.
  In this work, we show that this non-uniformity can be avoided at the expense of a small loss. First, we present a simple 2-approximate kernelization algorithm for Treewidth-d-Deletion with kernel size g(d) * k^5. Next, we show that the approximation factor can be made arbitrarily close to 1, if we settle for a kernelization protocol with O(1) calls to an oracle that solves instances of size bounded by a uniform polynomial in k.
  We also obtain linear kernels on sparse graph classes when F contains a planar graph, whereas the previously known theorems required all graphs in F to be connected. Specifically, we generalize the kernelization algorithm by Kim, Langer, Paul, Reidl, Rossmanith, Sau & Sikdar [TALG 2015] on graph classes that exclude a topological minor.

Conclusion: 这些结果明确了连通性约束覆盖问题在硬度和FPT近似性之间的边界。

Abstract: We revisit connectivity-constrained coverage through a unifying model, Partial Connected Red-Blue Dominating Set. Given a red-blue bipartite graph $G$ and an auxiliary connectivity graph $G_{conn}$ on red vertices, and integers $k, t$, the task is to find a $k$-sized subset of red vertices that dominates at least $t$ blue vertices, and that induces a connected subgraph in $G_{conn}$. This formulation captures connected variants of Max Coverage, Partial Dominating Set, and Partial Vertex Cover studied in prior literature.
  After identifying (parameterized) inapproximability results inherited from known problems, we first show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable by $t$. Furthermore, when the bipartite graph excludes $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph, we design (resp. efficient) parameterized approximation schemes for approximating $t$ (resp. $k$). Notably, these FPT approximations do not impose any restrictions on $G_{conn}$. Together, these results chart the boundary between hardness and FPT-approximability for connectivity-constrained coverage.

Abstract: We study stable matchings that are robust to preference changes in the two-sided stable matching setting of Gale and Shapley [GS62]. Given two instances $A$ and $B$ on the same set of agents, a matching is said to be robust if it is stable under both instances. This notion captures desirable robustness properties in matching markets where preferences may evolve, be misreported, or be subject to uncertainty. While the classical theory of stable matchings reveals rich lattice, algorithmic, and polyhedral structure for a single instance, it is unclear which of these properties persist when stability is required across multiple instances. Our work initiates a systematic study of the structural and computational behavior of robust stable matchings under increasingly general models of preference changes.
  We analyze robustness under a hierarchy of perturbation models:
  1. a single upward shift in one agent's preference list,
  2. an arbitrary permutation change by a single agent, and
  3. arbitrary preference changes by multiple agents on both sides.
  For each regime, we characterize when:
  1. the set of robust stable matchings forms a sublattice,
  2. the lattice of robust stable matchings admits a succinct Birkhoff partial order enabling efficient enumeration,
  3. worker-optimal and firm-optimal robust stable matchings can be computed efficiently, and
  4. the robust stable matching polytope is integral (by studying its LP formulation).
  We provide explicit counterexamples demonstrating where these structural and geometric properties break down, and complement these results with XP-time algorithms running in $O(n^k)$ time, parameterized by $k$, the number of agents whose preferences change. Our results precisely delineate the boundary between tractable and intractable cases for robust stable matchings.

Abstract: In knockout tournaments, players compete in successive rounds, with losers eliminated and winners advancing until a single champion remains. Given a tournament digraph $D$, which encodes the outcomes of all possible matches, and a designated player $v^* \in V(D)$, the \textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem (TFP) asks whether the tournament can be scheduled in a way that guarantees $v^*$ emerges as the winner. TFP is known to be NP-hard, but is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by structural measures such as the feedback arc set (fas) or feedback vertex set (fvs) number of the tournament digraph. In this paper, we introduce and study two new structural parameters: the number of players who can defeat $v^*$ (i.e., the in-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $k$) and the number of players that $v^*$ can defeat (i.e., the out-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $\ell$).
  A natural question is that: can TFP be efficiently solved when $k$ or $\ell$ is small? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that TFP is FPT when parameterized by either the in-degree or out-degree of $v^*$. Our algorithm for the in-degree parameterization is particularly involved and technically intricate. Notably, the in-degree $k$ can remain small even when other structural parameters, such as fas or fvs, are large. Hence, our results offer a new perspective and significantly broaden the parameterized algorithmic understanding of the \textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How should cities invest to improve social welfare when individuals respond strategically to local conditions? We model this question using a game-theoretic version of Schelling's bounded neighbourhood model, where agents choose neighbourhoods based on concave, non-monotonic utility functions reflecting local population. While naive improvements may worsen outcomes - analogous to Braess' paradox - we show that carefully designed, small-scale investments can reliably align individual incentives with societal goals. Specifically, modifying utilities at a total cost of at most $0.81 ε^2 \cdot \texttt{opt}$ guarantees that every resulting Nash equilibrium achieves a social welfare of at least $ε\cdot \texttt{opt}$, where $\texttt{opt}$ is the optimum social welfare. Our results formalise how targeted interventions can transform supra-negative outcomes into supra-positive returns, offering new insights into strategic urban planning and decentralised collective behaviour.

Abstract: Distributed multi-agent systems use large language models to enable collaborative intelligence while preserving privacy, yet systematic evaluations of long-term memory under network constraints remain limited. This study presents a flexible testbed comparing mem0, a vector-based memory framework, and Graphiti, a graph-based knowledge graph, using the LOCOMO long-context benchmark. Experiments were conducted under unconstrained and constrained network conditions, measuring computational, financial, and accuracy metrics. Results indicate that mem0 significantly outperforms Graphiti in efficiency, with faster loading times, lower resource consumption, and minimal network overhead, while accuracy differences are not statistically significant. Applying a statistical pareto efficiency framework, mem0 is identified as the optimal choice that balances cost and accuracy in DMAS.

Method: 从四个维度审视推荐系统基于画像的方法，提出包含实体画像生成、画像感知的知识图谱聚合、成对画像偏好匹配三个核心组件的SPiKE模型。

Result: SPiKE在真实场景中始终优于现有的基于知识图谱和大语言模型的推荐器。

Conclusion: SPiKE模型在推荐系统中具有有效性和优势。

Abstract: Rich and informative profiling to capture user preferences is essential for improving recommendation quality. However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings.

Result: 实验验证了马尔可夫预训练相较于传统推荐预训练和近期语言预训练范式的优越性。

Conclusion: MPT具有通用性和可迁移性，马尔可夫预训练是有效的推荐预训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Markovian Pre-trained Transformer (MPT) for next-item recommendation, a transferable model fully pre-trained on synthetic Markov chains, yet capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance by fine-tuning a lightweight adaptor. This counterintuitive success stems from the observation of the `Markovian' nature: advanced sequential recommenders coincidentally rely on the latest interaction to make predictions, while the historical interactions serve mainly as auxiliary cues for inferring the user's general, non-sequential identity. This characteristic necessitates the capabilities of a universal recommendation model to effectively summarize the user sequence, with particular emphasis on the latest interaction. MPT inherently has the potential to be universal and transferable. On the one hand, when trained to predict the next state of Markov chains, it acquires the capabilities to estimate transition probabilities from the context (one adaptive manner for summarizing sequences) and attend to the last state to ensure accurate state transitions. On the other hand, unlike the heterogeneous interaction data, an unlimited amount of controllable Markov chains is available to boost the model capacity. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets from three distinct platforms to validate the superiority of Markovian pre-training over traditional recommendation pre-training and recent language pre-training paradigms.

Abstract: As the volume of unstructured text continues to grow across domains, there is an urgent need for scalable methods that enable interpretable organization, summarization, and retrieval of information. This work presents a unified framework for interpretable topic modeling, zero-shot topic labeling, and topic-guided semantic retrieval over large agricultural text corpora. Leveraging BERTopic, we extract semantically coherent topics. Each topic is converted into a structured prompt, enabling a language model to generate meaningful topic labels and summaries in a zero-shot manner. Querying and document exploration are supported via dense embeddings and vector search, while a dedicated evaluation module assesses topical coherence and bias. This framework supports scalable and interpretable information access in specialized domains where labeled data is limited.

Conclusion: MLPlatt方法能在不损害排序质量的前提下实现高质量校准。

Abstract: Ranking models are extensively used in e-commerce for relevance estimation. These models often suffer from poor interpretability and no scale calibration, particularly when trained with typical ranking loss functions. This paper addresses the problem of post-hoc calibration of ranking models. We introduce MLPlatt: a simple yet effective ranking model calibration method that preserves the item ordering and converts ranker outputs to interpretable click-through rate (CTR) probabilities usable in downstream tasks. The method is context-aware by design and achieves good calibration metrics globally, and within strata corresponding to different values of a selected categorical field (such as user country or device), which is often important from a business perspective of an E-commerce platform. We demonstrate the superiority of MLPlatt over existing approaches on two datasets, achieving an improvement of over 10\% in F-ECE (Field Expected Calibration Error) compared to other methods. Most importantly, we show that high-quality calibration can be achieved without compromising the ranking quality.

Result: 在Amazon Beauty和MovieLens - 1M数据集上，HoloMambaRec始终优于SASRec，在10轮训练预算下与GRU4Rec有竞争力，且内存复杂度低。

Conclusion: HoloMambaRec是可扩展、支持元数据的顺序推荐的实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Sequential recommender systems must model long-range user behavior while operating under strict memory and latency constraints. Transformer-based approaches achieve strong accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, forcing aggressive truncation of user histories and limiting their practicality for long-horizon modeling. This paper presents HoloMambaRec, a lightweight sequential recommendation architecture that combines holographic reduced representations for attribute-aware embedding with a selective state space encoder for linear-time sequence processing. Item and attribute information are bound using circular convolution, preserving embedding dimensionality while encoding structured metadata. A shallow selective state space backbone, inspired by recent Mamba-style models, enables efficient training and constant-time recurrent inference. Experiments on Amazon Beauty and MovieLens-1M datasets demonstrate that HoloMambaRec consistently outperforms SASRec and achieves competitive performance with GRU4Rec under a constrained 10-epoch training budget, while maintaining substantially lower memory complexity. The design further incorporates forward-compatible mechanisms for temporal bundling and inference-time compression, positioning HoloMambaRec as a practical and extensible alternative for scalable, metadata-aware sequential recommendation.

Motivation: 现有基准对密集检索模型位置偏差评估不足，其位置无关的相关性标签混淆了长文本处理挑战和位置偏差问题。

Method: 引入PosIR全面基准，涵盖310个数据集，跨10种语言和31个领域，通过严格流程构建，使相关性与精确参考区间关联。

Result: 1. PosIR在长文本设置下的性能与MMTEB基准相关性差；2. 位置偏差普遍且随文档长度增加而加剧，多数模型有首因偏差，部分有近因偏差；3. 梯度显著性分析揭示了位置偏好的内部注意机制。

Conclusion: PosIR是一个有价值的诊断框架，可促进位置稳健的检索系统的发展。

Abstract: While dense retrieval models have achieved remarkable success, rigorous evaluation of their sensitivity to the position of relevant information (i.e., position bias) remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks typically employ position-agnostic relevance labels, conflating the challenge of processing long contexts with the bias against specific evidence locations. To address this challenge, we introduce PosIR (Position-Aware Information Retrieval), a comprehensive benchmark designed to diagnose position bias in diverse retrieval scenarios. PosIR comprises 310 datasets spanning 10 languages and 31 domains, constructed through a rigorous pipeline that ties relevance to precise reference spans, enabling the strict disentanglement of document length from information position. Extensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art embedding models reveal that: (1) Performance on PosIR in long-context settings correlates poorly with the MMTEB benchmark, exposing limitations in current short-text benchmarks; (2) Position bias is pervasive and intensifies with document length, with most models exhibiting primacy bias while certain models show unexpected recency bias; (3) Gradient-based saliency analysis further uncovers the distinct internal attention mechanisms driving these positional preferences. In summary, PosIR serves as a valuable diagnostic framework to foster the development of position-robust retrieval systems.

Conclusion: 所提的多通道推荐模型能有效解决现有会话推荐系统的问题，提升推荐精度。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation systems must capture implicit user intents from sessions. However, existing models suffer from issues such as item interaction dominance and noisy sessions. We propose a multi-channel recommendation model, including a knowledge graph channel, a session hypergraph channel, and a session line graph channel, to capture information from multiple sources. Our model adaptively removes redundant edges in the knowledge graph channel to reduce noise. Knowledge graph representations cooperate with hypergraph representations for prediction to alleviate item dominance. We also generate in-session attention for denoising. Finally, we maximize mutual information between the hypergraph and line graph channels as an auxiliary task. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the accuracy of various recommendations, including e-commerce and multimedia recommendations. We release the code on GitHub for reproducibility.\footnote{https://github.com/hohehohe0509/DSR-HK}

Conclusion: 承诺未来更新VeriTaS，建立抗泄漏基准，支持基础模型快速发展时代有意义的AFC评估，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: The growing scale of online misinformation urgently demands Automated Fact-Checking (AFC). Existing benchmarks for evaluating AFC systems, however, are largely limited in terms of task scope, modalities, domain, language diversity, realism, or coverage of misinformation types. Critically, they are static, thus subject to data leakage as their claims enter the pretraining corpora of LLMs. As a result, benchmark performance no longer reliably reflects the actual ability to verify claims. We introduce Verified Theses and Statements (VeriTaS), the first dynamic benchmark for multimodal AFC, designed to remain robust under ongoing large-scale pretraining of foundation models. VeriTaS currently comprises 24,000 real-world claims from 108 professional fact-checking organizations across 54 languages, covering textual and audiovisual content. Claims are added quarterly via a fully automated seven-stage pipeline that normalizes claim formulation, retrieves original media, and maps heterogeneous expert verdicts to a novel, standardized, and disentangled scoring scheme with textual justifications. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that the automated annotations closely match human judgments. We commit to update VeriTaS in the future, establishing a leakage-resistant benchmark, supporting meaningful AFC evaluation in the era of rapidly evolving foundation models. We will make the code and data publicly available.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验表明，RMBRec准确率优于现有方法，且在噪声干扰下稳定性好。

Conclusion: RMBRec能有效解决多行为推荐中辅助行为与目标行为不一致问题，既准确又稳定，代码开源可复现。

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation faces a critical challenge in practice: auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, carts) are often noisy, weakly correlated, or semantically misaligned with the target behavior (e.g., purchase), which leads to biased preference learning and suboptimal performance. While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.
  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations.

Conclusion: FusID框架有效解决了现有生成式推荐系统的局限，有更好的性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation systems have achieved significant advances by leveraging semantic IDs to represent items. However, existing approaches that tokenize each modality independently face two critical limitations: (1) redundancy across modalities that reduces efficiency, and (2) failure to capture inter-modal interactions that limits item representation. We introduce FusID, a modality-fused semantic ID framework that addresses these limitations through three key components: (i) multimodal fusion that learns unified representations by jointly encoding information across modalities, (ii) representation learning that brings frequently co-occurring item embeddings closer while maintaining distinctiveness and preventing feature redundancy, and (iii) product quantization that converts the fused continuous embeddings into multiple discrete tokens to mitigate ID conflict. Evaluated on a multimodal next-song recommendation (i.e., playlist continuation) benchmark, FusID achieves zero ID conflicts, ensuring that each token sequence maps to exactly one song, mitigates codebook underutilization, and outperforms baselines in terms of MRR and Recall@k (k = 1, 5, 10, 20).

Abstract: The evolution of recommender systems has shifted preference storage from rating matrices and dense embeddings to semantic memory in the agentic era. Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型对内存和计算预算压力大，需要有原则的压缩方法用于部署和持续训练。

Method: 采用两阶段方案，先将大权重移入稀疏矩阵S，再对残差矩阵进行递归HSS低秩分解，引入递归降秩策略和RCM排列。

Result: 在LLaMA - 7B上，仅针对自注意力投影参数，在30%稀疏率和外秩512时，sHSS - RCM困惑度达1.64，优于密集基线和经典稀疏加SVD变体，实现显著内存节省。

Conclusion: HSS压缩方案硬件友好，可端到端训练，能在大语言模型中有效节省内存并保持性能。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) place extraordinary pressure on memory and compute budgets, making principled compression indispensable for both deployment and continued training. We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual matrix. A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once). HSS is hardware-friendly: its matrix-vector multiply reduces to one sparse and a sequence of thin-matrix multiplications and can be trained end-to-end with standard optimisers.
  Experiments on LLaMA-7B show that targeting only the self-attention projections (1.6 B parameters of Q, K, and V matrices out of a total 7B parameters) suffices to yield large memory savings while retaining comparable state-of-the-art perplexity scores on test samples of the WikiText dataset. For example, with a 30\% sparsity budget and an outer rank of 512, sHSS-RCM achieves a perplexity of 1.64, outperforming dense baselines and classical sparse-plus-SVD variants, while also achieving significant memory savings.

Motivation: 经典自编码器（如VAE）在强压缩时难以保留流体流动的高阶统计结构。

Method: 提出DiffCoder，将概率扩散模型与传统卷积ResNet编码器耦合，端到端训练。

Result: 在强压缩下，DiffCoder显著提高光谱精度，更好保留流场分布结构；中等压缩时，大尺寸VAE仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 扩散生成解码为复杂流场的紧凑、统计一致表示提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Data-driven flow-field reconstruction typically relies on autoencoder architectures that compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent representations. However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.

Motivation: 基于EEG的情绪分类对未见过受试者泛化是挑战，正则化CL方法在该问题适用性缺乏探索。

Method: 在DREAMER和SEED数据集上，从理论和实证上研究正则化CL方法，在受试者递增序列下分析其局限性。

Result: 正则化CL方法表现有限，正向迁移无显著改善，性能对受试者顺序敏感。

Conclusion: 正则化持续学习方法用于基于EEG的情绪分类对未见过受试者的鲁棒泛化有局限性。

Abstract: Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.

Motivation: 主流序列模型如Transformer通过密集注意力权重隐式表示结构，存在二次复杂度问题。

Method: 提出RewriteNets架构，每层有可学习规则，包含模糊匹配、冲突解决、规则应用和未处理令牌传播四个操作，用直传Gumbel - Sinkhorn估计器进行端到端训练。

Result: RewriteNets在需要系统性泛化的任务上表现出色，计算效率高于Transformer。

Conclusion: RewriteNets架构为具有显式结构归纳偏差的序列建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Dominant sequence models like the Transformer represent structure implicitly through dense attention weights, incurring quadratic complexity. We propose RewriteNets, a novel neural architecture built on an alternative paradigm: explicit, parallel string rewriting. Each layer in a RewriteNet contains a set of learnable rules. For each position in an input sequence, the layer performs four operations: (1) fuzzy matching of rule patterns, (2) conflict resolution via a differentiable assignment operator to select non-overlapping rewrites, (3) application of the chosen rules to replace input segments with output segments of potentially different lengths, and (4) propagation of untouched tokens. While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training. We evaluate RewriteNets on algorithmic, compositional, and string manipulation tasks, comparing them against strong LSTM and Transformer baselines. Results show that RewriteNets excel at tasks requiring systematic generalization (achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark's length split) and are computationally more efficient than Transformers. We also provide an analysis of learned rules and an extensive ablation study, demonstrating that this architecture presents a promising direction for sequence modeling with explicit structural inductive biases.

Conclusion: HOSC是INR应用中实用的周期性激活函数，并给出特定领域超参数选择指导。

Abstract: Periodic activations such as sine preserve high-frequency information in implicit neural representations (INRs) through their oscillatory structure, but often suffer from gradient instability and limited control over multi-scale behavior. We introduce the Hyperbolic Oscillator with Saturation Control (HOSC) activation, $\text{HOSC}(x) = \tanh\bigl(β\sin(ω_0 x)\bigr)$, which exposes an explicit parameter $β$ that controls the Lipschitz bound of the activation by $βω_0$. This provides a direct mechanism to tune gradient magnitudes while retaining a periodic carrier. We provide a mathematical analysis and conduct a comprehensive empirical study across images, audio, video, NeRFs, and SDFs using standardized training protocols. Comparative analysis against SIREN, FINER, and related methods shows where HOSC provides substantial benefits and where it achieves competitive parity. Results establish HOSC as a practical periodic activation for INR applications, with domain-specific guidance on hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently modify the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) without compromising their other capabilities. The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.
  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.

Conclusion: NOVAK的架构贡献，特别是整流、解耦衰减和混合动量，对训练缺少跳跃连接的深度普通网络至关重要，解决了现有自适应优化方法的长期局限。

Abstract: This work introduces NOVAK, a modular gradient-based optimization algorithm that integrates adaptive moment estimation, rectified learning-rate scheduling, decoupled weight regularization, multiple variants of Nesterov momentum, and lookahead synchronization into a unified, performance-oriented framework. NOVAK adopts a dual-mode architecture consisting of a streamlined fast path designed for production. The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers. The results highlight that NOVAKs architectural contributions (particularly rectification, decoupled decay, and hybrid momentum) are crucial for reliable training of deep plain networks lacking skip connections, addressing a long-standing limitation of existing adaptive optimization methods.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains challenging due to high inter-subject variability, limited labeled data, and the lack of interpretable reasoning in existing approaches. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing.

Conclusion: 分布对齐能简单有效地提升前沿量化方法性能，代码开源利于超低比特量化发展。

Abstract: The benefits of most large language models come with steep and often hidden economic and environmental costs due to their resource usage inefficiency during deployment. Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization.

Our results demonstrate that multivariate max-min structure of operators, besides their algebraic elegance, provide efficient and stable approximation tools in both theoretical and applied settings.

Abstract: Deep double descent is one of the key phenomena underlying the generalization capability of deep learning models. In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a "benign overfitting" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as "outliers," "massive activa-tions," and "super activations" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of "deep double descent," "benign overfitting," and "large activation", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.

Conclusion: Sherry是一种有效的硬件高效三元量化框架，可用于大语言模型在边缘设备的部署。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is increasingly hindered by prohibitive memory and computational requirements. While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs), which leverage bidirectional attention and a denoising process, are narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models (ARMs). However, their internal attention mechanisms remain under-explored. This paper investigates the attention behaviors in MDMs, revealing the phenomenon of Attention Floating. Unlike ARMs, where attention converges to a fixed sink, MDMs exhibit dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps and layers. Further analysis reveals its Shallow Structure-Aware, Deep Content-Focused attention mechanism: shallow layers utilize floating tokens to build a global structural framework, while deeper layers allocate more capability toward capturing semantic content. Empirically, this distinctive attention pattern provides a mechanistic explanation for the strong in-context learning capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to double the performance compared to ARMs in knowledge-intensive tasks.

We introduce a training model called LLM-DAL (Large Language Model - Decompositional Algorithmic Learning), through which we demonstrate that LLMs' ability to perform complex algorithmic inferences and generalize can be significantly improved when the training method is properly designed to guide the model in its learning process.

Abstract: The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Functional group replacement is a pivotal approach in cheminformatics to enable the design of novel chemical compounds with tailored properties. Traditional methods for functional group removal and replacement often rely on rule-based heuristics, which can be limited in their ability to generate diverse and novel chemical structures. Recently, transformer-based models have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of molecular transformations, but existing approaches typically focus on single-step modeling, lacking the guarantee of structural similarity. In this work, we seek to advance the state of the art by developing a novel two-stage transformer model for functional group removal and replacement. Unlike one-shot approaches that generate entire molecules in a single pass, our method generates the functional group to be removed and appended sequentially, ensuring strict substructure-level modifications. Using a matched molecular pairs (MMPs) dataset derived from ChEMBL, we trained an encoder-decoder transformer model with SMIRKS-based representations to capture transformation rules effectively. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's ability to generate chemically valid transformations, explore diverse chemical spaces, and maintain scalability across varying search sizes.

Conclusion: Med - MoE - LoRA框架有效解决大语言模型在医学领域的多任务自适应问题，能够高效完成任务并保留通用推理能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted focus from general-purpose capabilities to domain-specific expertise. However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the "Stability-Plasticity Dilemma", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) "Task Interference", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a "Knowledge-Preservation Plugin", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.

Conclusion: 凸显了深度强化学习在局部搜索中的前景和实际限制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently gained traction as a means to improve combinatorial optimization methods, yet its effectiveness within local search metaheuristics specifically remains comparatively underexamined. In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $ε$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $ε$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of deep reinforcement learning in local search.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting long-term atmospheric variables remains a defining challenge in meteorological science due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy.

Abstract: The acceleration of materials discovery requires digital platforms that go beyond data repositories to embed learning, optimization, and decision-making directly into research workflows. We introduce DataScribe, an AI-native, cloud-based materials discovery platform that unifies heterogeneous experimental and computational data through ontology-backed ingestion and machine-actionable knowledge graphs. The platform integrates FAIR-compliant metadata capture, schema and unit harmonization, uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling, and native multi-objective multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, enabling closed-loop propose-measure-learn workflows across experimental and computational pipelines. DataScribe functions as an application-layer intelligence stack, coupling data governance, optimization, and explainability rather than treating them as downstream add-ons. We validate the platform through case studies in electrochemical materials and high-entropy alloys, demonstrating end-to-end data fusion, real-time optimization, and reproducible exploration of multi-objective trade spaces. By embedding optimization engines, machine learning, and unified access to public and private scientific data directly within the data infrastructure, and by supporting open, free use for academic and non-profit researchers, DataScribe functions as a general-purpose application-layer backbone for laboratories of any scale, including self-driving laboratories and geographically distributed materials acceleration platforms, with built-in support for performance, sustainability, and supply-chain-aware objectives.

Motivation: 传统ETA模型主要针对下一停靠港，依赖实时AIS数据，无法用于未来航段预测，因此需改进。

Method: 将未来港口ETA预测转化为分段级时间序列预测问题，开发基于Transformer的架构，采用因果掩码注意力机制和多任务学习头。

Result: 在真实全球数据集上，该模型优于多种基线模型，MAE和MAPE有显著相对下降。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型在预测分段航行时长和港口拥堵状态方面具有更高的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasts of segment-level sailing durations are fundamental to enhancing maritime schedule reliability and optimizing long-term port operations. However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE. Case studies for the major destination port further illustrate the model's superior accuracy.

Result: 在七个同质性图基准数据集的直推和归纳设置中，InfGraND始终优于先前的GNN到MLP知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: InfGraND具有实用性，适用于现实世界中众多对延迟敏感的应用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the go-to model for graph data analysis. However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: "How important is a node to the structure of the graph?" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 所提框架在测地不完全情况下能保持稳定收敛。

Abstract: In this paper, we study Riemannian zeroth-order optimization in settings where the underlying Riemannian metric $g$ is geodesically incomplete, and the goal is to approximate stationary points with respect to this incomplete metric. To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.

Motivation: 物联网存在DoS攻击威胁，资源受限边缘设备部署入侵检测难，KAN虽参数少但计算开销大不适合物联网应用。

Method: 提出查找表（LUT）编译流水线，用预计算量化表和线性插值取代样条计算。

Result: 轻量级KAN模型在CICIDS2017 DoS数据集上准确率达99.0%；LUT编译后，批量256提速68倍，批量1提速超5000倍，F1下降<0.0004，仅2倍内存开销。

Conclusion: LUT编译的KAN能在仅CPU的物联网网关上进行实时DoS检测，推理延迟确定，资源占用小。

Abstract: Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose a critical threat to Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, yet deploying effective intrusion detection on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a compact alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate spline functions on edges rather than fixed activations on nodes, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters. However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality. Our lightweight KAN model (50K parameters, 0.19~MB) achieves 99.0\% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 DoS dataset. After LUT compilation with resolution $L=8$, the model maintains 98.96\% accuracy (F1 degradation $<0.0004$) while achieving $\mathbf{68\times}$ speedup at batch size 256 and over $\mathbf{5000\times}$ speedup at batch size 1, with only $2\times$ memory overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs. Our results demonstrate that LUT-compiled KANs enable real-time DoS detection on CPU-only IoT gateways with deterministic inference latency and minimal resource footprint.

Result: 实验表明该方法大幅减少不安全行为，保留任务性能，降低内存使用和GPU时长，能在40分钟内恢复微调后7B大语言模型安全对齐。

Conclusion: 该工作为安全部署提供实用、一站式解决方案。

Abstract: Public large language models (LLMs) are typically safety-aligned during pretraining, yet task-specific fine-tuning required for deployment often erodes this alignment and introduces safety risks. Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.

Conclusion: 所提融合框架有效提升了跨主体脑电图情感识别的泛化能力。

Abstract: Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is challenged by pronounced inter-subject variability and the difficulty of learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition. The code has been released at https://github.com/Danielz-z/LGF-EEG-Emotion.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones are dangerous natural hazards, but their hazard is challenging to quantify directly from historical datasets due to limited dataset size and quality. Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques.

Abstract: Contextual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) tackles the problem of solving a set of related Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) that vary across different context variables. Traditional approaches--independent training and multi-task learning--struggle with either excessive computational costs or negative transfer. A recently proposed multi-policy approach, Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), has demonstrated effectiveness by strategically selecting a few tasks to train and zero-shot transfer. However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric. These results highlight the promise of online structure detection for guiding source task selection in complex CRL environments.

Motivation: 探究XGBoost中树内列子采样是否会使合成信号更困难。

Method: 使用两种具有抵消结构的合成数据生成过程，改变colsample_bylevel和colsample_bynode参数，设置含工程特征的控制特征集。

Result: 树内列子采样在仅使用原始特征时降低测试PR - AUC，有工程特征时影响消失，性能下降处路径共使用度量也下降。

Conclusion: 若存在类似比率结构，要么避免树内子采样，要么包含预期的比率特征。

Abstract: Many applied problems contain signal that becomes clear only after combining multiple raw measurements. Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has driven broad advances across scientific and engineering domains. Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.

Conclusion: RFM框架有效解决了无直接目标样本下扩散和流模型的训练问题，提高了在线强化学习训练的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow policies are gaining prominence in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressive power, yet training them efficiently remains a critical challenge. A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.

Conclusion: RCF是有效的几何演化框架，DGSL - RCF算法能提升数据表示和任务表现。

Abstract: Geometric Representation Learning (GRL) aims to approximate the non-Euclidean topology of high-dimensional data through discrete graph structures, grounded in the manifold hypothesis. However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Many real-world tasks require optimizing expensive black-box functions accessible only through noisy evaluations, a setting commonly addressed with Bayesian optimization (BO). While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines.

Abstract: Tabular foundational models are pre-trained models designed for a wide range of tabular data tasks. They have shown strong performance across domains, yet their internal representations and learned concepts remain poorly understood. This lack of interpretability makes it important to study how these models process and transform input features. In this work, we analyze the information encoded inside the model's hidden representations and examine how these representations evolve across layers. We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models. They show that these models encode concrete and interpretable information, which moves us closer to making their decision processes more transparent and trustworthy.

Abstract: Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has attracted considerable attention due to its potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure.

Motivation: 探究分布式线性回归中迭代通信是否必要，以解决联邦学习协议需重复同步及收敛率受多种因素影响的问题。

Conclusion: 分布式线性回归中迭代通信并非必要，一次聚合式联邦岭回归是有效方法，在减少通信量等方面有优势，适用于部分模型。

Abstract: Federated learning protocols require repeated synchronization between clients and a central server, with convergence rates depending on learning rates, data heterogeneity, and client sampling. This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\times$ less communication. The framework applies to kernel methods and random feature models but not to general nonlinear architectures.

Conclusion: 完全代理、无阈值的降阶是经典数值算法可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Can a small team of agents peel a matrix apart, one rank-1 slice at a time? We propose an agentic approach to matrix deflation in which a solver Large Language Model (LLM) generates rank-1 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) updates and a Vision Language Model (VLM) accepts or rejects each update and decides when to stop, eliminating fixed norm thresholds. Solver stability is improved through in-context learning (ICL) and types of row/column permutations that expose visually coherent structure. We evaluate on Digits ($8{\times}8$), CIFAR-10 ($32{\times}32$ grayscale), and synthetic ($16{\times}16$) matrices with and without Gaussian noise. In the synthetic noisy case, where the true construction rank $k$ is known, numerical deflation provides the noise target and our best agentic configuration differs by only $1.75$ RMSE of the target. For Digits and CIFAR-10, targets are defined by deflating until the Frobenius norm reaches $10\%$ of the original. Across all settings, our agent achieves competitive results, suggesting that fully agentic, threshold-free deflation is a viable alternative to classical numerical algorithms.

Conclusion: GADPN能在不同网络类型中稳健学习增强的图结构。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.

Abstract: Financial markets are influenced by human behavior that deviates from rationality due to cognitive biases. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models for financial decision-making assume rational agents, potentially overlooking the impact of psychological factors. This study integrates cognitive biases into RL frameworks for financial trading, hypothesizing that such models can exhibit human-like trading behavior and achieve better risk-adjusted returns than standard RL agents. We introduce biases, such as overconfidence and loss aversion, into reward structures and decision-making processes and evaluate their performance in simulated and real-world trading environments. Despite its inconclusive or negative results, this study provides insights into the challenges of incorporating human-like biases into RL, offering valuable lessons for developing robust financial AI systems.

Abstract: In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.

Conclusion: 明确了深层L - Lipschitz网络初始化信息快速丢失原因，给出选择初始化超参数建议，但实际应用中He初始化表现更佳。

Abstract: We analyze initialization dynamics for LDLT-based $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz layers by deriving the exact marginal output variance when the underlying parameter matrix $W_0\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is initialized with IID Gaussian entries $\mathcal{N}(0,σ^2)$. The Wishart distribution, $S=W_0W_0^\top\sim\mathcal{W}_m(n,σ^2 \boldsymbol{I}_m)$, used for computing the output marginal variance is derived in closed form using expectations of zonal polynomials via James' theorem and a Laplace-integral expansion of $(α\boldsymbol{I}_m+S)^{-1}$. We develop an Isserlis/Wick-based combinatorial expansion for $\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}\left[\operatorname{tr}(S^k)\right]$ and provide explicit truncated moments up to $k=10$, which yield accurate series approximations for small-to-moderate $σ^2$. Monte Carlo experiments confirm the theoretical estimates. Furthermore, empirical analysis was performed to quantify that, using current He or Kaiming initialization with scaling $1/\sqrt{n}$, the output variance is $0.41$, whereas the new parameterization with $10/ \sqrt{n}$ for $α=1$ results in an output variance of $0.9$. The findings clarify why deep $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz networks suffer rapid information loss at initialization and offer practical prescriptions for choosing initialization hyperparameters to mitigate this effect. However, using the Higgs boson classification dataset, a hyperparameter sweep over optimizers, initialization scale, and depth was conducted to validate the results on real-world data, showing that although the derivation ensures variance preservation, empirical results indicate He initialization still performs better.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection aims to identify a compact subset of features that captures the intrinsic structure of data without supervised label. Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.

This paper presents a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a graphical command-line interface for generating realistic synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) beats to support early diagnosis and patient stratification in CA. The tool is designed for usability, allowing clinical researchers to train class-specific generators once and then interactively produce large volumes of labelled synthetic beats that preserve the distribution of minority classes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $Δ$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $Δ$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.

Conclusion: ORBIT是一个有效的可控多预算推理框架，可解决现有大推理模型存在的问题。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by leveraging long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but uniformly applying overlong reasoning at inference time incurs substantial and often unnecessary computational cost. To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.

Result: Simplatab平均测试AUC最高（81.81%），运行时间适中；LightAutoML执行最快且表现有竞争力（均值AUC 78.74%，6分钟）；多数特定于放射组学的框架因过时等未纳入性能分析，通用框架可及性和实施便利性更高。

Conclusion: Simplatab在放射组学分类问题上实现了性能、效率和可及性的有效平衡，但当前AutoML框架存在不足，未来研究应适应放射组学特定挑战。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks can lower technical barriers for predictive and prognostic model development in radiomics by enabling researchers without programming expertise to build models. However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.

Abstract: Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise from ships contribute significantly to underwater sound pollution, posing risks to marine ecosystems. This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.

Method: 提出MMD Guidance，在反向扩散过程中加入生成样本与参考数据集的最大均值差异（MMD）梯度，该方法可自然扩展到条件生成模型的提示感知适应，且适用于潜在扩散模型。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，MMD Guidance能实现分布对齐并保持样本保真度。

Conclusion: MMD Guidance是一种有效的训练-free机制，可解决预训练扩散模型的分布不匹配问题。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.

Motivation: 现有优化器如Muon只部分满足宽度不变激活控制约束，存在权重漂移问题，需改进。

Method: 引入谱球优化器SSO，对权重及其更新实施严格的逐模块谱约束，在谱球上推导最速下降方向，并在Megatron中实现为高效并行算法。

Result: 在多种架构的广泛预训练中，SSO始终优于AdamW和Muon，有显著实际稳定性好处。

Conclusion: SSO是一种有效的优化策略，能解决现有优化器的局限，实现完全μP对齐的优化过程。

Abstract: Scaling large models requires optimization strategies that ensure rapid convergence grounded in stability. Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbolμ$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $Θ(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\boldsymbolμ$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations.

Method: 引入多通道U-Net，在五个不同PDE族上评估，并与ViT、AFNO等架构在相同训练设置下比较。

Conclusion: 在小数据周期性二维PDE设置中，与局部性和周期性边界条件对齐的卷积架构是准确且适度抗分布外情况的替代模型的有力竞争者。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a central tool for modeling the dynamics of physical, engineering, and materials systems, but high-fidelity simulations are often computationally expensive. At the same time, many scientific applications can be viewed as the evolution of spatially distributed fields, making data-driven forecasting of such fields a core task in scientific machine learning. In this work we study autoregressive deep-learning surrogates for two-dimensional PDE dynamics on periodic domains, focusing on generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions within a fixed PDE and parameter regime and on strict small-data settings with at most $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ simulated trajectories per system. We introduce a multi-channel U-Net [...], evaluate it on five qualitatively different PDE families and compare it to ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, and KAN-UNet under a common training setup. Across all datasets, me-UNet matches or outperforms these more complex architectures in terms of field-space error, spectral similarity, and physics-based metrics for in-distribution rollouts, while requiring substantially less training time. It also generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as $\approx 20$ training simulations. A data-efficiency study and Grad-CAM analysis further suggest that, in small-data periodic 2D PDE settings, convolutional architectures with inductive biases aligned to locality and periodic boundary conditions remain strong contenders for accurate and moderately out-of-distribution-robust surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

Abstract: Online on-policy preference learning algorithms for language model alignment such as online direct policy optimization (DPO) can significantly outperform their offline counterparts. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.

Conclusion: DiffMM框架能有效且高效地完成地图匹配，尤其适用于稀疏轨迹和复杂道路网络拓扑。

Abstract: Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.

Abstract: We introduce Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model to integrate irregular time series and unstructured clinical narratives. We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a widely used approach for post-training large language models on reasoning tasks, with group-based methods such as GRPO and its variants gaining broad adoption. These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.
  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.

Abstract: We introduce a two-stage multitask learning framework for analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning. In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.

While we focus on regression, our method extends naturally to classification and generalized additive models, offering a path toward more intelligible and trustworthy predictions.

Abstract: Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy for Markov decision processes with safety constraints. We formulate the problem in a reach-avoid setup. Our goal is to design online reinforcement learning algorithms that ensure safety constraints with arbitrarily high probability during the learning phase. To this end, we first propose an algorithm based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle. Based on the first algorithm, we propose our main algorithm, which utilizes entropy regularization. We investigate the finite-sample analysis of both algorithms and derive their regret bounds. We demonstrate that the inclusion of entropy regularization improves the regret and drastically controls the episode-to-episode variability that is inherent in OFU-based safe RL algorithms.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in high-dimensional, time-dependent simulation data is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics. We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning holds great promise for solving differential equations, yet existing methods struggle with highly oscillatory, multiscale, or singularly perturbed PDEs due to spectral bias, costly backpropagation, and manually tuned kernel or Fourier frequencies. This work introduces a soft partition--based Kernel-Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (KAPI-ELM), a deterministic low-dimensional parameterization in which smooth partition lengths jointly control collocation centers and Gaussian kernel widths, enabling continuous coarse-to-fine resolution without Fourier features, random sampling, or hard domain interfaces. A signed-distance-based weighting further stabilizes least-squares learning on irregular geometries. Across eight benchmarks--including oscillatory ODEs, high-frequency Poisson equations, irregular-shaped domains, and stiff singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems-the proposed method matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) variants while using only a single linear solve. Although demonstrated on steady linear PDEs, the results show that soft-partition kernel adaptation provides a fast, architecture-free approach for multiscale PDEs with broad potential for future physics-informed modeling.

Conclusion: 研究成果有助于非遍历系统强化学习方法的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a central optimisation framework in machine learning. Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems.

Motivation: 解决人工智能系统缺乏可解释性的问题，尤其是在医疗和金融等高风险领域。

Method: 在二值化并降维的MNIST数据集上训练量子玻尔兹曼机（QBMs）和经典玻尔兹曼机（CBMs），采用PCA进行预处理，使用梯度显著性图和SHAP评估特征归因。

Result: QBMs在分类准确率上优于CBMs（83.5% vs. 54%），且特征归因分布更集中（熵：1.27 vs. 1.39）。

Conclusion: 量子 - 经典混合模型可提升准确性和可解释性，有助于构建更可信和可解释的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of "active ingredient" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够实现接近最优的性能。

Abstract: We study a decentralized collaborative requesting problem that aims to optimize the information freshness of time-sensitive clients in edge networks consisting of multiple clients, access nodes (ANs), and servers. Clients request content through ANs acting as gateways, without observing AN states or the actions of other clients. We define the reward as the age of information reduction resulting from a client's selection of an AN, and formulate the problem as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit. In this decentralized and partially observable setting, the resulting reward process is history-dependent and coupled across clients, and exhibits both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards, rendering classical bandit-based approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose the AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm, which combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions. We establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and we validate the theoretical results through simulations.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决强化学习在大语言模型应用中的探索崩溃问题，提升推理性能和解决方案多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.

Motivation: 将CLASSIX算法从原本基于欧几里得距离扩展到其他距离度量，如曼哈顿距离和谷本距离。

Method: 使用数据向量的适当范数作为排序标准，结合三角不等式进行搜索终止，对于谷本距离使用更尖锐的交集不等式。

Result: 在真实世界化学指纹基准测试中，CLASSIX Tanimoto比Taylor - Butina算法快约30倍，比DBSCAN快约80倍，且聚类质量更高。

Conclusion: 扩展后的CLASSIX算法在不同距离度量下能有效提高聚类速度和质量。

Abstract: The CLASSIX algorithm is a fast and explainable approach to data clustering. In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases.

Method: 提出基于突触稳态假说的神经形态正则化方案，有周期性离线阶段，抑制外部输入、使突触权重向稳态基线随机衰减、通过自发活动巩固记忆。

Result: 该睡眠 - 觉醒周期可防止权重饱和并保留学习结构，在STDP - SNN模型中低到中等睡眠时长提升稳定性，在SG - SNN中无明显效果。

Conclusion: 基于睡眠的周期性重归一化可能是神经形态系统中稳定局部Hebbian学习的基本机制，与现有基于梯度的优化方法集成时需特别注意。

Abstract: Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) provides a biologically-plausible learning mechanism for spiking neural networks (SNNs); however, Hebbian weight updates in architectures with recurrent connections suffer from pathological weight dynamics: unbounded growth, catastrophic forgetting, and loss of representational diversity. We propose a neuromorphic regularization scheme inspired by the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis: periodic offline phases during which external inputs are suppressed, synaptic weights undergo stochastic decay toward a homeostatic baseline, and spontaneous activity enables memory consolidation. We demonstrate that this sleep-wake cycle prevents weight saturation while preserving learned structure. Empirically, we find that low to intermediate sleep durations (10-20\% of training) improve stability on MNIST-like benchmarks in our STDP-SNN model, without any data-specific hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, the same sleep intervention yields no measurable benefit for the surrogate-gradient spiking neural network (SG-SNN). Taken together, these results suggest that periodic, sleep-based renormalization may represent a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing local Hebbian learning in neuromorphic systems, while also indicating that special care is required when integrating such protocols with existing gradient-based optimization methods.

Abstract: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) provides a biologically grounded learning rule for spiking neural networks (SNNs), but its reliance on precise spike timing and pairwise updates limits fast learning of weights. We introduce a supervised extension of Spike Agreement-Dependent Plasticity (SADP), which replaces pairwise spike-timing comparisons with population-level agreement metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The proposed learning rule preserves strict synaptic locality, admits linear-time complexity, and enables efficient supervised learning without backpropagation, surrogate gradients, or teacher forcing.
  We integrate supervised SADP within hybrid CNN-SNN architectures, where convolutional encoders provide compact feature representations that are converted into Poisson spike trains for agreement-driven learning in the SNN. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and biomedical image classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance and fast convergence. Additional analyses show stable performance across broad hyperparameter ranges and compatibility with device-inspired synaptic update dynamics. Together, these results establish supervised SADP as a scalable, biologically grounded, and hardware-aligned learning paradigm for spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Evolving neural network architectures is a computationally demanding process. Traditional methods often require an extensive search through large architectural spaces and offer limited understanding of how structural modifications influence model behavior. This paper introduces \gls{ngspt}, a novel Neuroevolution algorithm based on two key innovations. First, we adapt geometric semantic operators~(GSOs) from genetic programming to neural network evolution, ensuring that architectural changes produce predictable effects on network semantics within a unimodal error surface. Second, we introduce a novel operator (DGSM) that enables controlled reduction of network size, while maintaining the semantic properties of~GSOs. Unlike traditional approaches, \gls{ngspt}'s efficient evaluation mechanism, which only requires computing the semantics of newly added components, allows for efficient population-based training, resulting in a comprehensive exploration of the search space at a fraction of the computational cost. Experimental results on four regression benchmarks show that \gls{ngspt} consistently evolves compact neural networks that achieve performance comparable to or better than established methods in the literature, such as standard neural networks, SLIM-GSGP, TensorNEAT, and SLM.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has mostly focused on learning policies, typically neural networks, that operate on a single candidate solution at a time, either by constructing one from scratch or iteratively improving it. In contrast, decades of work in metaheuristics have shown that maintaining and evolving populations of solutions improves robustness and exploration, and often leads to stronger performance. To close this gap, we study how to make NCO explicitly population-based by learning policies that act on sets of candidate solutions. We first propose a simple taxonomy of population awareness levels and use it to highlight two key design challenges: (i) how to represent a whole population inside a neural network, and (ii) how to learn population dynamics that balance intensification (generating good solutions) and diversification (maintaining variety). We make these ideas concrete with two complementary tools: one that improves existing solutions using information shared across the whole population, and the other generates new candidate solutions that explicitly balance being high-quality with diversity. Experimental results on Maximum Cut and Maximum Independent Set indicate that incorporating population structure is advantageous for learned optimization methods and opens new connections between NCO and classical population-based search.

Result: 以GPT - 3训练为例，过往方法节能2%，内核级方法节能14.6%，减速仅0.6%，且该方法在数据和张量并行方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 内核级DVFS是减少大语言模型操作能耗的合适技术，节能显著且减速可忽略。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI has fueled the expansion of accelerator- or GPU-based data centers. However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown). We further investigate the effect of data and tensor parallelism, and show our discovered clock frequencies translate well for both. We conclude that kernel-level DVFS is a suitable technique to reduce waste in LLM operations, providing significant energy savings with negligible slow-down.

Abstract: Identifying the strengths and limitations of a research paper is a core component of any literature review. However, traditional summaries reflect only the authors' self-presented perspective. Analyzing how other researchers discuss and cite the paper can offer a deeper, more practical understanding of its contributions and shortcomings. In this research, we introduce SECite, a novel approach for evaluating scholarly impact through sentiment analysis of citation contexts. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract citations referencing nine research papers and apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with unsupervised machine learning to classify these citation statements as positive or negative. Beyond sentiment classification, we use generative AI to produce sentiment-specific summaries that capture the strengths and limitations of each target paper, derived both from clustered citation groups and from the full text. Our findings reveal meaningful patterns in how the academic community perceives these works, highlighting areas of alignment and divergence between external citation feedback and the authors' own presentation. By integrating citation sentiment analysis with LLM-based summarization, this study provides a comprehensive framework for assessing scholarly contributions.

While this empowers agents to perform complex tasks, LLMs may invoke unintended tool interactions and introduce risks, such as leaking sensitive data or overwriting critical records, which are unacceptable in enterprise contexts. Current approaches to mitigate these risks, such as model-based safeguards, enhance agents' reliability but cannot guarantee system safety. Methods like information flow control (IFC) and temporal constraints aim to provide guarantees but often require extensive human annotation. We propose a process that starts with applying System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to identify hazards in agent workflows, derive safety requirements, and formalize them as enforceable specifications on data flows and tool sequences. To enable this, we introduce a capability-enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that requires structured labels on capabilities, confidentiality, and trust level. Together, these contributions aim to shift LLM-based agent safety from ad hoc reliability fixes to proactive guardrails with formal guarantees, while reducing dependence on user confirmation and making autonomy a deliberate design choice.

### [166] [Automating API Documentation from Crowdsourced Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08036)
*Bonan Kou,Zijie Zhou,Muhao Chen,Tianyi Zhang*

TL;DR: 提出AutoDoc方法利用Stack Overflow知识生成API文档，评估显示比基线更优，用户认可其有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多官方API文档过时且不完整，需要新的方法生成API文档。

Method: 使用微调的密集检索模型从SO帖子识别七种API知识，用GPT - 4o总结文本，设计组件处理幻觉和冗余。

Result: AutoDoc生成的文档准确率高77.7%、重复率低9.5%，含34.4%官方未覆盖知识；不同LLMs测试有效果；用户认为更优。

Conclusion: 精心设计下利用LLMs进行API文档生成是可行的。

Abstract: API documentation is crucial for developers to learn and use APIs. However, it is known that many official API documents are obsolete and incomplete. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach called AutoDoc that generates API documents with API knowledge extracted from online discussions on Stack Overflow (SO). AutoDoc leverages a fine-tuned dense retrieval model to identify seven types of API knowledge from SO posts. Then, it uses GPT-4o to summarize the API knowledge in these posts into concise text. Meanwhile, we designed two specific components to handle LLM hallucination and redundancy in generated content. We evaluated AutoDoc against five comparison baselines on 48 APIs of different popularity levels. Our results indicate that the API documents generated by AutoDoc are up to 77.7% more accurate, 9.5% less duplicated, and contain 34.4% knowledge uncovered by the official documents. We also measured the sensitivity of AutoDoc to the choice of different LLMs. We found that while larger LLMs produce higher-quality API documents, AutoDoc enables smaller open-source models (e.g., Mistral-7B-v0.3) to achieve comparable results. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the API documents generated by AutoDoc. All participants found API documents generated by AutoDoc to be more comprehensive, concise, and helpful than the comparison baselines. This highlights the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for API documentation with careful design to counter LLM hallucination and information redundancy.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development is transforming programming from a solution-generative to a solution-evaluative activity. This shift opens a pathway for new cognitive challenges that amplify existing decision-making biases or create entirely novel ones. One such type of challenge stems from cognitive biases, which are thinking patterns that lead people away from logical reasoning and result in sub-optimal decisions. How do cognitive biases manifest and impact decision-making in emerging AI-collaborative development? This paper presents the first comprehensive study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining observational studies with 14 student and professional developers, followed by surveys with 22 additional developers. We qualitatively compare categories of biases affecting developers against the traditional non-LLM workflows. Our findings suggest that LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel biases. Through a systematic analysis of 90 cognitive biases specific to developer-LLM interactions, we develop a taxonomy of 15 bias categories validated by cognitive psychologists. We found that 48.8% of total programmer actions are biased, and developer-LLM interactions account for 56.4% of these biased actions. We discuss how these bias categories manifest, present tools and practices for developers, and recommendations for LLM tool builders to help mitigate cognitive biases in human-AI programming.

Motivation: 道路场景数据集存在冗余情况，减缓测试进程且不提升故障检测能力。

Method: 基于ADAS驾驶行为的几何和动态特征对道路场景聚类，选取代表性案例保证覆盖度，再根据几何复杂度、驾驶难度和历史故障对道路排序。

Result: 平均减少89%测试套件规模，保留79%失败道路场景，优先级策略比随机基线最多提升95倍早期故障检测能力。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效减少测试冗余，提升故障检测效率。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) rely on extensive testing to ensure safety and reliability, yet road scenario datasets often contain redundant cases that slow down the testing process without improving fault detection. To address this issue, we present a novel test prioritization framework that reduces redundancy while preserving geometric and behavioral diversity. Road scenarios are clustered based on geometric and dynamic features of the ADAS driving behavior, from which representative cases are selected to guarantee coverage. Roads are finally prioritized based on geometric complexity, driving difficulty, and historical failures, ensuring that the most critical and challenging tests are executed first. We evaluate our framework on the OPENCAT dataset and the Udacity self-driving car simulator using two ADAS models. On average, our approach achieves an 89% reduction in test suite size while retaining an average of 79% of failed road scenarios. The prioritization strategy improves early failure detection by up to 95x compared to random baselines.

Method: 在两个公认的C/C++漏洞数据集上评估五对大模型，比较微调与基于提示的方法。

Result: 微调在所有任务和模型中均优于零样本和少样本方法；代码专业模型在复杂任务的零样本和少样本设置中表现出色，通用模型也接近有效；当前指标不足以衡量修复质量。

Conclusion: 研究探索先进大语言模型改进漏洞分析和修复的潜力，为软件安全社区做出贡献。

Abstract: Context: Traditional software security analysis methods struggle to keep pace with the scale and complexity of modern codebases, requiring intelligent automation to detect, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities more efficiently and accurately. Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models. Notably, code-specialized models excel in zero-shot and few-shot settings on complex tasks, while general-purpose models remain nearly as effective. Discrepancies among CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore, BLEU, and ChrF highlight the inadequacy of current metrics for measuring repair quality. Conclusions: This study contributes to the software security community by investigating the potential of advanced LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis and remediation.

Motivation: 在复杂工业环境中，自然语言编写的技术手册检索故障排除程序慢且复杂，需工具辅助操作员检索。

Method: 对Fincantieri公司可用的故障排除程序进行一组实验分析。

Result: RAG能帮助操作员迅速应对故障症状，但执行建议前需交叉验证。

Conclusion: RAG可用于辅助操作员检索任务，但要对建议进行交叉验证。

Abstract: In today's complex industrial environments, operators must often navigate through extensive technical manuals to identify troubleshooting procedures that may help react to some observed failure symptoms. These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.

Conclusion: 讨论这些见解的影响。

Abstract: We present a critical review of Neural Coverage (NLC), a state-of-the-art DNN coverage criterion by Yuan et al. at ICSE 2023. While NLC proposes to satisfy eight design requirements and demonstrates strong empirical performance, we question some of their theoretical and empirical assumptions. We observe that NLC deviates from core principles of coverage criteria, such as monotonicity and test suite order independence, and could more fully account for key properties of the covariance matrix. Additionally, we note threats to the validity of the empirical study, related to the ground truth ordering of test suites. Through our empirical validation, we substantiate our claims and propose improvements for future DNN coverage metrics. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of these insights.

Result: 在多个评估中，TerraFormer相比其基础大语言模型提高了正确性，在TF - Gen和TF - Mutn测试中优于更大模型，在IaC - Eval中排名第三，实现最佳实践和安全合规。

Conclusion: TerraFormer在IaC生成和变异方面表现出色，能有效提高配置的正确性和合规性。

Abstract: Automating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is challenging, and large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect configurations from natural language (NL). We present TerraFormer, a neuro-symbolic framework for IaC generation and mutation that combines supervised fine-tuning with verifier-guided reinforcement learning, using formal verification tools to provide feedback on syntax, deployability, and policy compliance. We curate two large, high-quality NL-to-IaC datasets, TF-Gen (152k instances) and TF-Mutn (52k instances), via multi-stage verification and iterative LLM self-correction. Evaluations against 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including ~50x larger models like Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.1, show that TerraFormer improves correctness over its base LLM by 15.94% on IaC-Eval, 11.65% on TF-Gen (Test), and 19.60% on TF-Mutn (Test). It outperforms larger models on both TF-Gen (Test) and TF-Mutn (Test), ranks third on IaC-Eval, and achieves top best-practices and security compliance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成在软件工程多跳架构推理方面存在不足，需要评估不同检索管道的性能。

Method: 在Java代码库上对三种检索管道（无图向量RAG、LLM生成知识图RAG、确定性AST派生知识图RAG）进行基准测试，使用15个架构和代码跟踪查询，测量多项指标。

Result: DKB建图快，索引完整，成本低，查询延迟与无图管道相似，答案正确性最高；LLM - KB建图慢，索引不完整，成本高，查询慢且不稳定；无图基线在架构查询中表现最差，幻觉风险高。

Conclusion: 确定性AST派生图比LLM提取图在覆盖范围和多跳推理上更可靠，且索引成本低。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for software engineering often relies on vector similarity search, which captures topical similarity but can fail on multi-hop architectural reasoning such as controller to service to repository chains, interface-driven wiring, and inheritance. This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.
  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.

Abstract: We introduce the AI Productivity Index for Software Engineering (APEX-SWE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can execute economically valuable software engineering work. Unlike existing evaluations that focus on narrow, well-defined tasks, APEX-SWE assesses two novel task types that reflect real-world software engineering work: (1) Integration tasks (n=100), which require constructing end-to-end systems across heterogeneous cloud primitives, business applications, and infrastructure-as-code services, and (2) Observability tasks (n=100), which require debugging production failures using telemetry signals such as logs and dashboards, as well as unstructured context. We evaluated eight frontier models on APEX-SWE. Gemini 3 Pro (Thinking = High) performs best, with a Pass@1 score of 25\%. Our analysis shows that strong performance is primarily driven by epistemic reasoning, defined as the ability to distinguish between assumptions and verified facts, combined with agency to resolve uncertainty prior to acting. We open-source the APEX-SWE evaluation harness and a dev set (n=50).

The novelty of our paper is the departure from the traditional normal returns setting. Our main contribution is the methodology for obtaining optimal portfolios. Numerical experiments reveal that, as expected, the optimal variance and VaR portfolio compositions differ by a significant amount, suggesting that more realistic tail risk settings can lead to potentially more realistic portfolio allocations.

Abstract: The integration of thematic satellite allocations into core-satellite portfolio architectures is commonly approached using factor exposures, discretionary convictions, or backtested performance, with feasibility assessed primarily through liquidity screens or market-impact considerations. While such approaches may be appropriate at institutional scale, they are ill-suited to small portfolios and robustness-oriented allocation frameworks, where dominant constraints arise not from return predictability or trading capacity, but from fixed costs, irreversibility risk, and governance complexity. This paper develops a feasibility-first, non-predictive framework for satellite integration that is explicitly scale-aware. We formalize four nested feasibility layers (physical, economic, structural, and epistemic) that jointly determine whether a satellite allocation is admissible. Physical feasibility ensures implementability under concave market-impact laws; economic feasibility suppresses noise-dominated reallocations via cost-dominance threshold constraints; structural feasibility bounds satellite size through an explicit optionality budget defined by tolerable loss under thesis failure; and epistemic feasibility limits satellite breadth and dispersion through an entropy-based complexity budget. Within this hierarchy, structural optionality is identified as the primary design principle for thematic satellites, with the remaining layers acting as robustness lenses rather than optimization criteria. The framework yields closed-form feasibility bounds on satellite size, turnover, and breadth without reliance on return forecasts, factor premia, or backtested performance, providing a disciplined basis for integrating thematic satellites into small, robustness-oriented portfolios.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架可用于DeFi生态系统层面的系统风险分析和持续监测。

Abstract: Systemic risk refers to the overall vulnerability arising from the high degree of interconnectedness and interdependence within the financial system. In the rapidly developing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, numerous studies have analyzed systemic risk through specific channels such as liquidity pressures, leverage mechanisms, smart contract risks, and historical risk events. However, these studies are mostly event-driven or focused on isolated risk channels, paying limited attention to the structural dimension of systemic risk. Overall, this study provides a unified quantitative framework for ecosystem-level analysis and continuous monitoring of systemic risk in DeFi. From a network-based perspective, this paper proposes the DeFi Correlation Fragility Indicator (CFI), constructed from time-varying correlation networks at the protocol category level. The CFI captures ecosystem-wide structural fragility associated with correlation concentration and increasing synchronicity. Furthermore, we define a Risk Contribution Score (RCS) to quantify the marginal contribution of different protocol types to overall systemic risk. By combining the CFI and RCS, the framework enables both the tracking of time-varying systemic risk and identification of structurally important functional modules in risk accumulation and amplification.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), where multiple agents within a network collaboratively learn optimal decisions in real-time, arises naturally in applications such as federated learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent control.  In this paper, we study D-OCO under unknown, time-and agent-varying feedback delays. While recent work has addressed this problem (Nguyen et al., 2024), existing algorithms assume prior knowledge of the total delay over agents and still suffer from suboptimal dependence on both the delay and network parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves an improved regret bound of O N $\sqrt$ d tot + N $\sqrt$ T  (1-$σ$2) 1/4 , where T is the total horizon, d tot denotes the average total delay across agents, N is the number of agents, and 1 -$σ$ 2 is the spectral gap of the network. Our approach builds upon recent advances in D-OCO (Wan et al., 2024a), but crucially incorporates an adaptive learning rate mechanism via a decentralized communication protocol. This enables each agent to estimate delays locally using a gossip-based strategy without the prior knowledge of the total delay. We further extend our framework to the strongly convex setting and derive a sharper regret bound of O N $δ$max ln T $α$  , where $α$ is the strong convexity parameter and $δ$ max is the maximum number of missing observations averaged over agents. We also show that our upper bounds for both settings are tight up to logarithmic factors. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing improvements over existing benchmark algorithms.

Abstract: Since the turn of the century, approximate Bayesian inference has steadily evolved as new computational techniques have been incorporated to handle increasingly complex and large-scale predictive problems. The recent success of deep neural networks and foundation models has now given rise to a new paradigm in statistical modeling, in which Bayesian inference can be amortized through large-scale learned predictors. In amortized inference, substantial computation is invested upfront to train a neural network that can subsequently produce approximate posterior or predictions at negligible marginal cost across a wide range of tasks. At deployment, amortized inference offers substantial computational savings compared with traditional Bayesian procedures, which generally require repeated likelihood evaluations or Monte Carlo simulations for predictions for each new dataset.
  Despite the growing popularity of amortized inference, its statistical interpretation and its role within Bayesian inference remain poorly understood. This paper presents statistical perspectives on the working principles of several major neural architectures, including feedforward networks, Deep Sets, and Transformers, and examines how these architectures naturally support amortized Bayesian inference. We discuss how these models perform structured approximation and probabilistic reasoning in ways that yield controlled generalization error across a wide range of deployment scenarios, and how these properties can be harnessed for Bayesian computation. Through simulation studies, we evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and uncertainty quantification of amortized inference under varying signal-to-noise ratios and distributional shifts, highlighting both its strengths and its limitations.

Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel technique, named structural dimension reduction, to collapse a Bayesian network onto a minimum and localized one while ensuring that probabilistic inferences between the original and reduced networks remain consistent. To this end, we propose a new combinatorial structure in directed acyclic graphs called the directed convex hull, which has turned out to be equivalent to their minimum localized Bayesian networks. An efficient polynomial-time algorithm is devised to identify them by determining the unique directed convex hulls containing the variables of interest from the original networks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique has high dimension reduction capability in real networks, and the efficiency of probabilistic inference based on directed convex hulls can be significantly improved compared with traditional methods such as variable elimination and belief propagation algorithms. The code of this study is open at \href{https://github.com/Balance-H/Algorithms}{https://github.com/Balance-H/Algorithms} and the proofs of the results in the main body are postponed to the appendix.

Abstract: Multiple binary responses arise in many modern data-analytic problems. Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition. Exploiting the fact that the pairwise loss depends only on differences of linear predictors, we simplify computation and analysis. We establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, showing that under suitable regularity conditions, leading to linear convergence up to the minimax-optimal statistical precision. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in challenging settings such as label switching and data contamination and consistently outperforms likelihood-based approaches.

Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts such as justice, healthcare and finance, which has spawned a great demand for fairness in these procedures. However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs.

Result: 开发出对低噪声和精细时间离散化都鲁棒的新PF算法。

Conclusion: 通过数值示例验证了算法的有效性。

Abstract: We consider the discrete-time filtering problem in scenarios where the observation noise is degenerate or low. We focus on the case where the observation equation is a linear function of the state and that additive noise is low or degenerate, however, we place minimal assumptions on the hidden state process. In this scenario we derive new particle filtering (PF) algorithms and, under assumptions, in such a way that as the noise becomes more degenerate a PF which approximates the low noise filtering problem provably inherits the properties of the PF used in the degenerate case. We extend our framework to the case where the hidden states are drawn from a diffusion process. In this scenario we develop new PFs which are robust to both low noise and fine levels of time discretization. We illustrate our algorithms numerically on several examples.

Abstract: Although extensive research exists in spatial modeling, few studies have addressed finite mixture model-based clustering methods for spatial data. Finite mixture models, especially Gaussian mixture models, particularly suffer from high dimensionality due to the number of free covariance parameters. This study introduces a spatial covariance constraint for Gaussian mixture models that requires only four free parameters for each component, independent of dimensionality. Using a coordinate system, the spatially constrained Gaussian mixture model enables clustering of multi-way spatial data and inference of spatial patterns. The parameter estimation is conducted by combining the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator. Simulation studies and applications to Raman spectroscopy data are provided to demonstrate the proposed model.

Result: 烟草广告牌禁令使吸烟率降低，最多降0.9个百分点，约3%；影响主要来自女性和25 - 44岁、65岁以上人群。

Conclusion: 部分烟草广告禁令（如广告牌禁令）可有效降低吸烟率，是烟草预防综合策略中的重要政策工具。

Abstract: This study assesses the impact of tobacco billboard bans on smoking in Switzerland, exploiting their staggered adoption across regions, i.e., the cantons. Based on retrospective smoking histories from the Swiss Health Survey, a panel of individuals' annual smoking status is reconstructed, containing more than one million observations from 1993 to 2017. Estimation relies on staggered difference-in-differences as well as a complementary latent factor model, which relaxes the common trends assumption. The findings indicate that tobacco billboard bans lead to a reduction in smoking rates. Reductions of up to 0.9 percentage points correspond to an approximate 3% decline in the smoking rate. The effect is driven by women and individuals aged 25-44 and 65+. Overall, this evidence suggests that even partial tobacco advertising bans, such as billboard bans, can effectively reduce smoking rates and serve as a valuable policy tool within comprehensive tobacco prevention strategies.

Method: 采用陈述偏好（SP）调查和离散选择建模方法，包括多项逻辑（MNL）和混合逻辑（MMNL）模型。

Result: 消费者对无人机配送感兴趣，但成本和可靠性限制采用；年轻和男性消费者偏好更高；产品类型影响大；消费者对价格和速度敏感。

Conclusion: 研究结果为物流服务提供商和政策制定者在定价策略、服务目标和部署方法等方面提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: The potential for drone delivery services to transform logistics systems and consumer behavior has gained increasing attention. However, comprehensive empirical evidence on consumer delivery choice behavior within the context of transportation and urban air logistics remains limited, particularly in Japan. This study addresses this gap by examining Japanese consumers' preferences and behavioral intentions toward drone delivery services. Using a stated preference (SP) survey and discrete choice modeling approaches, including multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (MMNL) models, the analysis evaluates how delivery cost, delivery time, drop-off location, product type, and social influence affect delivery mode choices across different demographic groups. The results indicate that although consumers express interest in drone delivery, perceived cost and concerns related to reliability continue to constrain adoption. Younger and male consumers exhibit higher preferences for drone delivery, while product type, particularly daily consumer goods and medical or healthcare items, plays a significant role in shaping preferences. Post-estimation willingness-to-pay and elasticity analyses further highlight consumers' sensitivity to delivery pricing and speed attributes. Overall, the findings provide actionable insights for logistics service providers and policymakers regarding pricing strategies, service targeting, and deployment approaches for integrating drone delivery into Japan's evolving logistics system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准理论难以解释重复公共物品博弈中观察到的行为大幅波动，现有异质社会偏好只能解释首轮贡献。

Method: 一是用动态时间规整算法按时间形状对行为轨迹聚类；二是应用分层逆Q学习框架，将决策建模为合作和背叛意图间的离散转换。

Result: 发现一种占比21.4%且之前未被建模的行为类型——Switchers，他们常改变意图而非坚持稳定策略；同时能识别出如持续合作和搭便车等典型策略行为。

Conclusion: 认识到行为的意图波动性有助于维持合作，Switchers短暂背叛常能反转，战略耐心可防止不必要的合作破裂。

Abstract: Behavior in repeated public goods games continues to challenge standard theory: heterogeneous social preferences can explain first-round contributions, but not the substantial volatility observed across repeated interactions. Using 50,390 decisions from 2,938 participants, we introduce two methodological advances to address this gap. First, we cluster behavioral trajectories by their temporal shape using Dynamic Time Warping, yielding distinct and theoretically interpretable behavioral types. Second, we apply a hierarchical inverse Q-learning framework that models decisions as discrete switches between latent cooperative and defective intentions. This approach reveals a large (21.4%) and previously unmodeled behavioral type -- Switchers -- who frequently reverse intentions rather than commit to stable strategies. At the same time, the framework recovers canonical strategic behaviors such as persistent cooperation and free-riding. Substantively, recognizing intentional volatility helps sustain cooperation: brief defections by Switchers often reverse, so strategic patience can prevent unnecessary breakdowns.

Result: 当按输入OBDD宽度、重构电路C的结构参数和二阶有限自动机A的大小进行参数化时，功能重构和分解可在固定参数线性时间内解决。

Conclusion: 利用功能重构概念和所提出的符号框架能有效解决功能分解问题，且在特定参数化下有较好时间复杂度。

Abstract: Functional decomposition is the process of breaking down a function $f$ into a composition $f=g(f_1,\dots,f_k)$ of simpler functions $f_1,\dots,f_k$ belonging to some class $\mathcal{F}$. This fundamental notion can be used to model applications arising in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from machine learning to formal language theory. In this work, we study functional decomposition by leveraging on the notion of functional reconfiguration. In this setting, constraints are imposed not only on the factor functions $f_1,\dots,f_k$ but also on the intermediate functions arising during the composition process.
  We introduce a symbolic framework to address functional reconfiguration and decomposition problems. In our framework, functions arising during the reconfiguration process are represented symbolically, using ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). The function $g$ used to specify the reconfiguration process is represented by a Boolean circuit $C$. Finally, the function class $\mathcal{F}$ is represented by a second-order finite automaton $\mathcal{A}$. Our main result states that functional reconfiguration, and hence functional decomposition, can be solved in fixed-parameter linear time when parameterized by the width of the input OBDD, by structural parameters associated with the reconfiguration circuit $C$, and by the size of the second-order finite automaton $\mathcal{A}$.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease arises from interactions between inherited risk, molecular programmes, and tissue-scale remodelling that are observed clinically through imaging. Health systems now routinely generate large volumes of cardiac MRI, CT and echocardiography together with bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, yet these data are still analysed in separate pipelines. This review examines joint representations that link cardiac imaging phenotypes to transcriptomic and spatially resolved molecular states. An imaging-anchored perspective is adopted in which echocardiography, cardiac MRI and CT define a spatial phenotype of the heart, and bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide cell-type- and location-specific molecular context. The biological and technical characteristics of these modalities are first summarised, and representation-learning strategies for each are outlined. Multimodal fusion approaches are reviewed, with emphasis on handling missing data, limited sample size, and batch effects. Finally, integrative pipelines for radiogenomics, spatial molecular alignment, and image-based prediction of gene expression are discussed, together with common failure modes, practical considerations, and open challenges. Spatial multiomics of human myocardium and atherosclerotic plaque, single-cell and spatial foundation models, and multimodal medical foundation models are collectively bringing imaging-anchored multiomics closer to large-scale cardiovascular translation.

Abstract: Background:Subject-specific finite element analysis accurately characterizes knee joint mechanics but is computationally expensive. Deep surrogate models provide a rapid alternative, yet their generalization across subjects under limited pose and load inputs remains unclear. It remains unclear whether the dominant source of prediction uncertainty arises from temporal history dependence or spatial propagation dependence. Methods:To disentangle these factors, we employed a shared MGN backbone with a fixed mesh topology. A dataset of running trials from nine subjects was constructed using an OpenSim-FEBio workflow. We developed four model variants to isolate specific dependencies: (1) a baseline MGN; (2) CT-MGN, incorporating a Control Transformer to encode short-horizon history; (3) MsgModMGN, applying state-conditioned modulation to message passing for adaptive propagation; (4) CT-MsgModMGN, combining both mechanisms. Models were evaluated using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects.Results:The models incorporating history encoding significantly outperformed the baseline MGN and MsgModMGN in global accuracy and spatial consistency. Crucially, the CT module effectively mitigated the peak-shaving defect common in deep surrogates, significantly reducing peak stress prediction errors. In contrast, the spatial propagation modulation alone yielded no significant improvement over the baseline, and combining it with CT provided no additional benefit.Conclusion:Temporal history dependence, rather than spatial propagation modulation, is the primary driver of prediction uncertainty in cross-subject knee contact mechanics. Explicitly encoding short-horizon driver sequences enables the surrogate model to recover implicit phase information, thereby achieving superior fidelity in peak-stress capture and high-risk localization compared to purely state-based approaches.

Conclusion: 以状态为中心的检索范式能实现高质量的检索和重排序结果，显著提升系统整体效率。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically employ a traditional two-stage pipeline: an embedding model for initial retrieval followed by a reranker for refinement. However, this paradigm suffers from significant inefficiency due to the lack of shared information between stages, leading to substantial redundant computation. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{State-Centric Retrieval}, a unified retrieval paradigm that utilizes "states" as a bridge to connect embedding models and rerankers. First, we perform state representation learning by fine-tuning an RWKV-based LLM, transforming it into \textbf{EmbeddingRWKV}, a unified model that serves as both an embedding model and a state backbone for extracting compact, reusable states. Building upon these reusable states, we further design a state-based reranker to fully leverage precomputed information. During reranking, the model processes only query tokens, decoupling inference cost from document length and yielding a 5.4$\times$--44.8$\times$ speedup. Furthermore, we observe that retaining all intermediate layer states is unnecessary; with a uniform layer selection strategy, our model maintains 98.62\% of full-model performance using only 25\% of the layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that State-Centric Retrieval achieves high-quality retrieval and reranking results while significantly enhancing overall system efficiency.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在高风险领域应用时，需更重视监管合规性，不能仅追求功能正确性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has enabled complex tool use, yet in high-stakes domains, these systems must strictly adhere to regulatory standards beyond simple functional correctness. However, existing benchmarks often overlook implicit regulatory compliance, thus failing to evaluate whether LLMs can autonomously enforce mandatory safety constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce LogiSafetyGen, a framework that converts unstructured regulations into Linear Temporal Logic oracles and employs logic-guided fuzzing to synthesize valid, safety-critical traces. Building on this framework, we construct LogiSafetyBench, a benchmark comprising 240 human-verified tasks that require LLMs to generate Python programs that satisfy both functional objectives and latent compliance rules. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal that larger models, despite achieving better functional correctness, frequently prioritize task completion over safety, which results in non-compliant behavior.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly used as support tools along mental therapeutic pathways with significant societal impacts. In particular, empathy is a key non-functional requirement in therapeutic contexts, yet current chatbot development practices provide no systematic means to specify or verify it. This paper envisions a framework integrating natural language processing and formal verification to deliver empathetic therapy chatbots. A Transformer-based model extracts dialogue features, which are then translated into a Stochastic Hybrid Automaton model of dyadic therapy sessions. Empathy-related properties can then be verified through Statistical Model Checking, while strategy synthesis provides guidance for shaping agent behavior. Preliminary results show that the formal model captures therapy dynamics with good fidelity and that ad-hoc strategies improve the probability of satisfying empathy requirements.

Abstract: While NLP typically treats documents as independent and unordered samples, in longitudinal studies, this assumption rarely holds: documents are nested within authors and ordered in time, forming person-indexed, time-ordered $\textit{behavioral sequences}$. Here, we demonstrate the need for and propose a longitudinal modeling and evaluation paradigm that consequently updates four parts of the NLP pipeline: (1) evaluation splits aligned to generalization over people ($\textit{cross-sectional}$) and/or time ($\textit{prospective}$); (2) accuracy metrics separating between-person differences from within-person dynamics; (3) sequence inputs to incorporate history by default; and (4) model internals that support different $\textit{coarseness}$ of latent state over histories (pooled summaries, explicit dynamics, or interaction-based models). We demonstrate the issues ensued by traditional pipeline and our proposed improvements on a dataset of 17k daily diary transcripts paired with PTSD symptom severity from 238 participants, finding that traditional document-level evaluation can yield substantially different and sometimes reversed conclusions compared to our ecologically valid modeling and evaluation. We tie our results to a broader discussion motivating a shift from word-sequence evaluation toward $\textit{behavior-sequence}$ paradigms for NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励建模架构的静态池化策略存在静态归纳偏差和表征不匹配的局限，需改进。

Method: 提出AdaJudge框架，先通过门控细化块将骨干表征细化到面向判别空间，再用自适应多视图池化模块替换静态读出。

Result: 在RM - Bench和JudgeBench上的大量实验显示，AdaJudge优于强大的现成奖励模型和传统池化基线。

Conclusion: AdaJudge框架有效，能解决现有奖励建模架构的问题。

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences, yet predominant architectures rely on a static pooling strategy to condense sequences into scalar scores. This paradigm, however, suffers from two key limitations: a static inductive bias that misaligns with task-dependent preference signals, and a representational mismatch, as the backbone is optimized for generation rather than fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose AdaJudge, a unified framework that jointly adapts representation and aggregation. AdaJudge first refines backbone representations into a discrimination-oriented space via gated refinement blocks. It then replaces the static readout with an adaptive multi-view pooling module that dynamically routes and combines evidence. Extensive experiments on RM-Bench and JudgeBench show that AdaJudge outperforms strong off-the-shelf reward models and traditional pooling baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NLP系统中乌尔都语代表性不足，现有多语言模型在乌尔都语特定任务上表现差。

Method: 采用两阶段方法开发Qalb模型，先在含19.7亿标记的数据集上持续预训练，再在Alif Urdu - instruct数据集上微调。

Result: Qalb在乌尔都语特定基准测试中大幅提升，加权平均分达90.34，超过之前的SOTA模型和基础模型，在七项任务上达SOTA。

Conclusion: 在多样高质量语言数据上持续预训练，结合针对性指令微调，能有效使基础模型适配低资源语言。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in large language models, Urdu-a language spoken by over 230 million people-remains critically underrepresented in modern NLP systems. Existing multilingual models demonstrate poor performance on Urdu-specific tasks, struggling with the language's complex morphology, right-to-left Nastaliq script, and rich literary traditions. Even the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model shows limited capability in generating fluent, contextually appropriate Urdu text. We introduce Qalb, an Urdu language model developed through a two-stage approach: continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Starting from LLaMA 3.1 8B, we perform continued pre-training on a dataset of 1.97 billion tokens. This corpus comprises 1.84 billion tokens of diverse Urdu text-spanning news archives, classical and contemporary literature, government documents, and social media-combined with 140 million tokens of English Wikipedia data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We then fine-tune the resulting model on the Alif Urdu-instruct dataset. Through extensive evaluation on Urdu-specific benchmarks, Qalb demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a weighted average score of 90.34 and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Alif-1.0-Instruct model (87.1) by 3.24 points, while also surpassing the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model by 44.64 points. Qalb achieves state-of-the-art performance with comprehensive evaluation across seven diverse tasks including Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Reasoning. Our results demonstrate that continued pre-training on diverse, high-quality language data, combined with targeted instruction fine-tuning, effectively adapts foundation models to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出CT - SFT方法解决大语言模型适配低资源语言的问题，该方法更新少量参数即可提高跨语言准确率并减少灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大语言模型适配到低资源语言存在标注数据稀缺、全模型微调不稳定和持续跨语言调优会导致灾难性遗忘等问题。

Method: 提出无反事实的CD - T适配方法CT - SFT，使用标签平衡平均基线和任务方向相关性评分确定代理语言检查点中一组稀疏的任务相关注意力头，通过头级梯度掩码仅更新这些注意力头（和LayerNorm）来迁移学习到目标语言。

Result: 在NusaX - Senti和XNLI上，CT - SFT更新少量模型参数的情况下，跨语言准确率高于持续全量微调。发现了编辑保留权衡现象，不同难度的迁移有不同的更新偏好。还大幅减少了灾难性遗忘，在迁移过程中保留了代理/源语言能力。

Conclusion: CT - SFT是一种有效的大语言模型适配低资源语言的方法，能在更新少量参数时提升性能并减少遗忘问题。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to low-resource languages is difficult: labeled data is scarce, full-model fine-tuning is unstable, and continued cross-lingual tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We propose Circuit-Targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning (CT-SFT): a counterfactual-free adaptation of CD-T (Contextual Decomposition Transformer) that uses a label-balanced mean baseline and task-directional relevance scoring to identify a sparse set of task-relevant attention heads in a proxy-language checkpoint, then transfer learns to a target language by updating only those heads (plus LayerNorm) via head-level gradient masking. Across NusaX-Senti and XNLI, CT-SFT improves cross-lingual accuracy over continued full fine-tuning while updating only a small subset of model parameters. We find an editing-preserving trade-off: harder transfers favor editing circuit heads, while easier transfers often favor near-zero (i.e., low-relevance heads) updates, preserving the source mechanism. CT-SFT also substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting, preserving proxy/source-language competence during transfer.

Motivation: 解决智能系统理解世界中概念关系表示的问题，提升大模型对关系知识的编码和推理能力。

Result: 微调函数向量在关系词完成任务表现佳，复合函数向量提升类比问题性能。

Conclusion: 激活补丁是编码和操作关系知识的可控机制，能提升大模型可解释性和推理能力。

Abstract: Representing relations between concepts is a core prerequisite for intelligent systems to make sense of the world. Recent work using causal mediation analysis has shown that a small set of attention heads encodes task representation in in-context learning, captured in a compact representation known as the function vector. We show that fine-tuning function vectors with only a small set of examples (about 20 word pairs) yields better performance on relation-based word-completion tasks than using the original vectors derived from causal mediation analysis. These improvements hold for both small and large language models. Moreover, the fine-tuned function vectors yield improved decoding performance for relation words and show stronger alignment with human similarity judgments of semantic relations. Next, we introduce the composite function vector - a weighted combination of fine-tuned function vectors - to extract relational knowledge and support analogical reasoning. At inference time, inserting this composite vector into LLM activations markedly enhances performance on challenging analogy problems drawn from cognitive science and SAT benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of activation patching as a controllable mechanism for encoding and manipulating relational knowledge, advancing both the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级上下文管理方法DyCP，在多个基准测试和大语言模型上提升答案质量并降低响应延迟，强调有效上下文管理重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型对话长度增长时响应延迟增加、答案质量下降，现有上下文管理方法存在效率低或破坏对话连续性问题。

Method: 引入DyCP方法，在查询时动态分段和检索相关内存，保留对话顺序结构且无预定义主题边界。

Result: 在LoCoMo、MT - Bench+和SCM4LLMs三个长对话基准测试和多个大语言模型上，DyCP提升答案质量同时降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 现代大语言模型扩展上下文窗口与实际长上下文处理能力存在差距，有效上下文管理仍很重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit increased response latency and degraded answer quality as dialogue length grows, making effective context management essential. However, existing methods rely on extra LLM calls to build memory or perform offline memory construction without considering the current user utterance, which can introduce inefficiencies or disrupt conversational continuity. We introduce DyCP, a lightweight context management method that dynamically segment and retrieve relevant memory at query time. It preserves the sequential structure of dialogue without predefined topic boundaries and supports efficient, adaptive context retrieval. Across three long-form dialogue benchmarks, LoCoMo, MT-Bench+, and SCM4LLMs, and multiple LLMs, DyCP consistently improves answer quality while reducing response latency. We also examine the gap between modern LLMs' expanded context windows and their actual long-context processing capacity, highlighting the continued importance of effective context management.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN方法存在优化不稳定，训练与生成指标不一致的问题，需要改进以更好适配下游应用。

Method: 提出T - SPIN方法，纳入历史优势稳定优化，引入熵约束消除训练与生成差异。

Result: T - SPIN在多个任务上表现优于SPIN，迭代稳定，用25%样本可比肩或超监督微调。

Conclusion: T - SPIN解决SPIN局限，面对稀缺标注数据十分有效。

Abstract: Recently, self-play fine-tuning (SPIN) has been proposed to adapt large language models to downstream applications with scarce expert-annotated data, by iteratively generating synthetic responses from the model itself. However, SPIN is designed to optimize the current reward advantages of annotated responses over synthetic responses at hand, which may gradually vanish during iterations, leading to unstable optimization. Moreover, the utilization of reference policy induces a misalignment issue between the reward formulation for training and the metric for generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Triplet-based Self-Play fIne-tuNing (T-SPIN) method that integrates two key designs. First, beyond current advantages, T-SPIN additionally incorporates historical advantages between iteratively generated responses and proto-synthetic responses produced by the initial policy. Even if the current advantages diminish, historical advantages remain effective, stabilizing the overall optimization. Second, T-SPIN introduces the entropy constraint into the self-play framework, which is theoretically justified to support reference-free fine-tuning, eliminating the training-generation discrepancy. Empirical results on various tasks demonstrate not only the superior performance of T-SPIN over SPIN, but also its stable evolution during iterations. Remarkably, compared to supervised fine-tuning, T-SPIN achieves comparable or even better performance with only 25% samples, highlighting its effectiveness when faced with scarce annotated data.

Conclusion: 交互结构可能替代模型规模来提升大语言模型创意生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with creative generation, and multi-agent frameworks that improve reasoning through interaction can paradoxically hinder creativity by inducing content homogenization. We introduce LLM Review, a peer-review-inspired framework implementing Blind Peer Review: agents exchange targeted feedback while revising independently, preserving divergent creative trajectories. To enable rigorous evaluation, we propose SciFi-100, a science fiction writing dataset with a unified framework combining LLM-as-a-judge scoring, human annotation, and rule-based novelty metrics. Experiments demonstrate that LLM Review consistently outperforms multi-agent baselines, and smaller models with our framework can surpass larger single-agent models, suggesting interaction structure may substitute for model scale.

Motivation: 当前基于总参数和活跃参数设计MoE模型不足以描述最优架构。

Method: 进行系统研究。

Result: MoE性能主要由总参数和专家稀疏度决定，专家总数多会因内存约束使核心模型维度降低而略损性能。

Conclusion: 提出在给定约束下，最大化总参数、最小化专家稀疏度和专家总数的设计原则，为解决架构模糊性和指导MoE设计提供框架。

Abstract: Modern Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models are designed based on total parameters (memory footprint) and active parameters (inference cost). However, we find these two factors alone are insufficient to describe an optimal architecture. Through a systematic study, we demonstrate that MoE performance is primarily determined by total parameters ($N_{total}$) and expert sparsity ($s:=n_{exp}/n_{topk}$).
  Moreover, $n_{exp}$ and $n_{topk}$ do not "cancel out" within the sparsity ratio; instead, a larger total number of experts slightly penalizes performance by forcing a reduction in core model dimensions (depth and width) to meet memory constraints. This motivates a simple principle for MoE design which maximizes $N_{total}$ while minimizing $s$ (maximizing $n_{topk}$) and $n_{exp}$ under the given constraints. Our findings provide a robust framework for resolving architectural ambiguity and guiding MoE design.

Motivation: 探究CoT提示起作用的原因及是否为触发LLM推理的唯一机制。

Method: 用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）直接分析和干预LLM的内部表征。

Result: 操控单个推理相关潜在特征可大幅提高准确率，大模型中潜在引导性能与标准CoT提示相当且输出更高效；推理内部状态在生成早期触发并可覆盖阻碍显式推理的提示指令。

Conclusion: LLM的多步推理由可外部激活的潜在内部激活支持，CoT提示是激活机制的有效但非唯一方式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has improved the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear why it works and whether it is the unique mechanism for triggering reasoning in large language models. In this work, we study this question by directly analyzing and intervening on the internal representations of LLMs with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), identifying a small set of latent features that are causally associated with LLM reasoning behavior. Across multiple model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that steering a single reasoning-related latent feature can substantially improve accuracy without explicit CoT prompting. For large models, latent steering achieves performance comparable to standard CoT prompting while producing more efficient outputs. We further observe that this reasoning-oriented internal state is triggered early in generation and can override prompt-level instructions that discourage explicit reasoning. Overall, our results suggest that multi-step reasoning in LLMs is supported by latent internal activations that can be externally activated, while CoT prompting is one effective, but not unique, way of activating this mechanism rather than its necessary cause.

Result: 在多个推理基准和大语言模型上的实验表明，ACPS在准确性、鲁棒性和计算效率方面始终优于现有提示基线。

Conclusion: ACPS能实现跨异构任务的可泛化因果推理，显著减少令牌使用和推理成本。

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in prompting methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), existing strategies still suffer from excessive token usage and limited generalisability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Causal Prompting with Sketch-of-Thought (ACPS) framework, which leverages structural causal models to infer the causal effect of a query on its answer and adaptively select an appropriate intervention (i.e., standard front-door and conditional front-door adjustments). This design enables generalisable causal reasoning across heterogeneous tasks without task-specific retraining. By replacing verbose CoT with concise Sketch-of-Thought, ACPS enables efficient reasoning that significantly reduces token usage and inference cost. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that ACPS consistently outperforms existing prompting baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Motivation: GRPO依赖昂贵外部验证器或人类规则，导致计算成本高、训练延迟和奖励稀疏，影响优化效率。

Method: 提出Latent - GRPO框架，从潜在空间几何获取内在奖励；发现推理轨迹终端标记表示的几何特性；引入IRCE算法生成连续奖励。

Result: 在多数据集实验中，保持模型性能，训练速度比基线快2倍以上，有强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Latent - GRPO框架能有效解决GRPO存在的问题，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this success heavily relies on expensive external verifiers or human rules. Such dependency not only leads to significant computational costs and training latency, but also yields sparse rewards that hinder optimization efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Latent-GRPO, a framework that derives intrinsic rewards directly from latent space geometry. Crucially, our empirical analysis reveals a compelling geometric property: terminal token representations of correct reasoning trajectories form dense clusters with high intra-class similarity, whereas incorrect trajectories remain scattered as outliers. In light of this discovery, we introduce the Iterative Robust Centroid Estimation (IRCE) algorithm, which generates dense, continuous rewards by mitigating magnitude fluctuations via spherical projection and estimating a robust ``truth centroid'' through iterative aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method maintains model performance while achieving a training speedup of over 2x compared to baselines. Furthermore, extensive results demonstrate strong generalization ability and robustness. The code will be released soon.

Method: 提出JudgeRLVR两阶段范式，先训练模型判断解决方案响应，再用基于判断阶段初始化的普通生成式RLVR微调模型。

Result: 在相同数学领域训练数据下，JudgeRLVR在Qwen3 - 30B - A3B的领域内数学任务上平均准确率提升约3.7点，平均生成长度减少42%；在领域外基准测试中平均准确率提升约4.5点。

Conclusion: JudgeRLVR实现了更好的质量 - 效率权衡，且具有增强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型整合推理机制后存在推理时后门攻击新风险，且此类攻击生成的推理路径语言连贯，传统检测方法难以应对。

Method: 提出STAR框架，利用恶意输入诱导路径前后概率的统计差异，量化状态转移放大比率，并使用CUSUM算法检测持续异常。

Result: 在8B - 70B的不同模型和5个基准数据集上实验，STAR泛化能力强，AUROC接近1.0，效率比现有基线高约42倍，且能抵御自适应攻击。

Conclusion: STAR框架在检测推理时后门攻击方面有良好表现，具备高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent LLMs increasingly integrate reasoning mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this explicit reasoning exposes a new attack surface for inference-time backdoors, which inject malicious reasoning paths without altering model parameters. Because these attacks generate linguistically coherent paths, they effectively evade conventional detection. To address this, we propose STAR (State-Transition Amplification Ratio), a framework that detects backdoors by analyzing output probability shifts. STAR exploits the statistical discrepancy where a malicious input-induced path exhibits high posterior probability despite a low prior probability in the model's general knowledge. We quantify this state-transition amplification and employ the CUSUM algorithm to detect persistent anomalies. Experiments across diverse models (8B-70B) and five benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR exhibits robust generalization capabilities, consistently achieving near-perfect performance (AUROC $\approx$ 1.0) with approximately $42\times$ greater efficiency than existing baselines. Furthermore, the framework proves robust against adaptive attacks attempting to bypass detection.

Motivation: 现有代理记忆框架不论查询特征对整个存储层进行穷举检索，随记忆增长产生严重延迟瓶颈，阻碍实时交互。

Method: 提出SwiftMem系统，通过在时间和语义维度上进行专门索引实现亚线性检索，包括可进行对数时间范围查询的时间索引和通过分层标签结构映射查询的语义DAG - Tag索引，引入嵌入标签联合整合机制处理内存碎片。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，SwiftMem比现有基准搜索速度快47倍，且保持有竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: SwiftMem能实现内存增强大语言模型代理的实际部署。

Abstract: Agentic memory systems have become critical for enabling LLM agents to maintain long-term context and retrieve relevant information efficiently. However, existing memory frameworks suffer from a fundamental limitation: they perform exhaustive retrieval across the entire storage layer regardless of query characteristics. This brute-force approach creates severe latency bottlenecks as memory grows, hindering real-time agent interactions. We propose SwiftMem, a query-aware agentic memory system that achieves sub-linear retrieval through specialized indexing over temporal and semantic dimensions. Our temporal index enables logarithmic-time range queries for time-sensitive retrieval, while the semantic DAG-Tag index maps queries to relevant topics through hierarchical tag structures. To address memory fragmentation during growth, we introduce an embedding-tag co-consolidation mechanism that reorganizes storage based on semantic clusters to improve cache locality. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftMem achieves 47$\times$ faster search compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment of memory-augmented LLM agents.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of large language model (LLM) responses requires not only factual correctness but also clarity, particularly in political question-answering. While recent datasets provide human annotations for clarity and evasion, the impact of prompt design on automatic clarity evaluation remains underexplored. In this paper, we study prompt-based clarity evaluation using the CLARITY dataset from the SemEval 2026 shared task. We compare a GPT-3.5 baseline provided with the dataset against GPT-5.2 evaluated under three prompting strategies: simple prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought with few-shot examples. Model predictions are evaluated against human annotations using accuracy and class-wise metrics for clarity and evasion, along with hierarchical exact match. Results show that GPT-5.2 consistently outperforms the GPT-3.5 baseline on clarity prediction, with accuracy improving from 56 percent to 63 percent under chain-of-thought with few-shot prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting yields the highest evasion accuracy at 34 percent, though improvements are less stable across fine-grained evasion categories. We further evaluate topic identification and find that reasoning-based prompting improves accuracy from 60 percent to 74 percent relative to human annotations. Overall, our findings indicate that prompt design reliably improves high-level clarity evaluation, while fine-grained evasion and topic detection remain challenging despite structured reasoning prompts.

Abstract: Recent results in learning a language in the limit have shown that, although language identification is impossible, language generation is tractable. As this foundational area expands, we need to consider the implications of language generation in real-world settings.
  This work offers the first theoretical treatment of safe language generation. Building on the computational paradigm of learning in the limit, we formalize the tasks of safe language identification and generation. We prove that under this model, safe language identification is impossible, and that safe language generation is at least as hard as (vanilla) language identification, which is also impossible. Last, we discuss several intractable and tractable cases.

Motivation: 解决LLM - as - a - Judge范式中冻结黑盒模型与人类标准对齐的挑战，处理固有生成随机性带来的问题。

Method: 引入RULERS框架，将自然语言规则转换为可执行规范，包括编译标准、强制结构化解码与确定性证据验证、应用基于Wasserstein的事后校准。

Result: 在论文和摘要基准测试中，RULERS在与人类评判一致性上显著优于代表性基线，对对抗性规则扰动保持强稳定性，小模型也能媲美大的专有评判模型。

Conclusion: 可靠的LLM评判需要可执行规则、可验证证据和校准尺度，而非仅依赖提示措辞。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm promises scalable rubric-based evaluation, yet aligning frozen black-box models with human standards remains a challenge due to inherent generation stochasticity. We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

TL;DR: 研究用提示工程增强大语言模型在情感分析任务中的表现，对比高级提示技术，发现表现提升且需根据模型和任务定制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究如何利用提示工程增强GPT - 4o - mini和gemini - 1.5 - flash在情感分析任务中的效果。

Method: 采用高级提示技术（少样本学习、思维链提示、自我一致性）与基线对比，通过精度、召回率、准确率和F1分数评估模型。

Result: 高级提示显著提升情感分析表现，少样本适用于GPT - 4o - mini，思维链使gemini - 1.5 - flash反讽检测提升46%。

Conclusion: 提示策略需根据模型架构和任务语义复杂度定制。

Abstract: This study investigates the use of prompt engineering to enhance large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini and gemini-1.5-flash, in sentiment analysis tasks. It evaluates advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency against a baseline. Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.

TL;DR: 提出Multiplex Thinking机制，在数学推理基准测试中表现优于离散CoT和RL基线且序列更短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型使用CoT解决复杂推理任务时存在长且低带宽的token序列问题，而人类常进行软推理，由此提出Multiplex Thinking。

Method: 提出Multiplex Thinking随机软推理机制，在每个思考步骤采样K个候选token并聚合为连续的多重token，可通过策略内强化学习直接优化。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，Multiplex Thinking从Pass@1到Pass@1024均优于强离散CoT和RL基线，且生成序列更短。

Conclusion: Multiplex Thinking是有效的推理机制，具有自适应性，在推理任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences. The code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/GMLR-Penn/Multiplex-Thinking.

Conclusion: 研究为教育应用中开发更个性化、有效的大语言模型使用方法奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their potential as educational tutors. However, different tutoring strategies benefit different student personalities, and mismatches can be counterproductive to student outcomes. Despite this, current LLM tutoring systems do not take into account student personality traits. To address this problem, we first construct a taxonomy that links pedagogical methods to personality profiles, based on pedagogical literature. We simulate student-teacher conversations and use our framework to let the LLM tutor adjust its strategy to the simulated student personality. We evaluate the scenario with human teachers and find that they consistently prefer our approach over two baselines. Our method also increases the use of less common, high-impact strategies such as role-playing, which human and LLM annotators prefer significantly. Our findings pave the way for developing more personalized and effective LLM use in educational applications.

Result: sui - 1显著优于所有测试的开放权重基线，包括参数多3倍的模型。

Conclusion: 针对特定任务的训练在引用引用的摘要任务上远胜单纯扩大模型规模。

Abstract: Large language models frequently generate plausible but unfaithful summaries that users cannot verify against source text, a critical limitation in compliance-sensitive domains such as government and legal analysis. We present sui-1, a 24B parameter model that produces abstractive summaries with inline citations, enabling users to trace each claim to its source sentence. Our synthetic data pipeline combines chain-of-thought prompting with multi-stage verification, generating over 22,000 high-quality training examples across five languages from diverse sources including parliamentary documents, web text, and Wikipedia. Evaluation shows sui-1 significantly outperforms all tested open-weight baselines, including models with 3x more parameters. These results demonstrate that task-specific training substantially outperforms scale alone for citation-grounded summarization. Model weights and an interactive demo are publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型的Overflow现象，提出BenchOverflow基准评估，发现轻量级缓解措施有效，强调长度控制重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overflow现象会导致服务成本增加、延迟和性能下降，有经济和环境影响，还可能造成计算放大和服务降级。

Method: 引入BenchOverflow，用标准化协议评估9个开源和闭源模型，用CSR和ECDF量化尾风险等。

Result: 量化了尾风险，发现Overflow可复现且有异构性，轻量级缓解措施能降低CSR。

Conclusion: 长度控制是可靠性、成本和可持续性问题，BenchOverflow为模型选择和评估防御措施提供依据。

Abstract: We investigate a failure mode of large language models (LLMs) in which plain-text prompts elicit excessive outputs, a phenomenon we term Overflow. Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance.

Motivation: 此前基准测试很少评估模型能否构建连贯故事世界并跨多种推理和生成形式运用，需评估模型能力

Method: 引入STAGE统一基准，定义四个任务，涵盖知识图构建等，提供多种资源进行评估

Result: 提供150部英语和中文电影的清理剧本、知识图、注释等多种资源

Conclusion: STAGE能对模型构建世界表示、抽象验证叙事事件等多方面能力进行全面评估

Abstract: Movie screenplays are rich long-form narratives that interleave complex character relationships, temporally ordered events, and dialogue-driven interactions. While prior benchmarks target individual subtasks such as question answering or dialogue generation, they rarely evaluate whether models can construct a coherent story world and use it consistently across multiple forms of reasoning and generation. We introduce STAGE (Screenplay Text, Agents, Graphs and Evaluation), a unified benchmark for narrative understanding over full-length movie screenplays. STAGE defines four tasks: knowledge graph construction, scene-level event summarization, long-context screenplay question answering, and in-script character role-playing, all grounded in a shared narrative world representation. The benchmark provides cleaned scripts, curated knowledge graphs, and event- and character-centric annotations for 150 films across English and Chinese, enabling holistic evaluation of models' abilities to build world representations, abstract and verify narrative events, reason over long narratives, and generate character-consistent responses.

Motivation: 现有方法在任务执行前被动注入经验，难以适应动态变化的上下文观测，需改进经验干预方式。

Method: 提出ExpSeek，包括估计步骤级熵阈值确定干预时机，设计步骤级定制化经验内容。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 8B和32B模型的四个具有挑战性的Web代理基准测试中，ExpSeek分别实现了9.3%和7.5%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 验证了熵作为自触发信号的可行性和优势，表明小的经验模型能显著提升大代理模型的性能。

Abstract: Experience intervention in web agents emerges as a promising technical paradigm, enhancing agent interaction capabilities by providing valuable insights from accumulated experiences. However, existing methods predominantly inject experience passively as global context before task execution, struggling to adapt to dynamically changing contextual observations during agent-environment interaction. We propose ExpSeek, which shifts experience toward step-level proactive seeking: (1) estimating step-level entropy thresholds to determine intervention timing using the model's intrinsic signals; (2) designing step-level tailor-designed experience content. Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Our experiments validate the feasibility and advantages of entropy as a self-triggering signal, reveal that even a 4B small-scale experience model can significantly boost the performance of larger agent models.

TL;DR: 研究通过控制道德取向探究其与政治定位的因果关系，发现道德调节会使模型政治坐标有显著、特定价值的转变，强调有效对齐需结合社会价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型政治取向评估方法主要是直接探测或人口统计学角色设计，而社会心理学认为政治意识形态是基本道德直觉的下游结果，所以要探究道德价值观与政治定位的因果关系。

Method: 将道德取向作为可控条件，让模型认可或拒绝特定道德价值观，用政治指南针测试评估其政治取向的转变，把道德价值观作为视角观察道德调节如何引导模型在经济和社会维度的走向。

Result: 道德调节使模型政治坐标产生显著、特定价值的转变，这些影响受角色框架和模型规模系统调节，且在体现相同道德价值的替代评估工具中稳健。

Conclusion: 有效的对齐需要将政治评估置于包括道德在内的更广泛社会价值背景下，为更具社会基础的对齐技术铺平道路。

Abstract: While recent research has systematically documented political orientation in large language models (LLMs), existing evaluations rely primarily on direct probing or demographic persona engineering to surface ideological biases. In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.

Abstract: Summarization of multi-party dialogues is a critical capability in industry, enhancing knowledge transfer and operational effectiveness across many domains. However, automatically generating high-quality summaries is challenging, as the ideal summary must satisfy a set of complex, multi-faceted requirements. While summarization has received immense attention in research, prior work has primarily utilized static datasets and benchmarks, a condition rare in practical scenarios where requirements inevitably evolve. In this work, we present an industry case study on developing an agentic system to summarize multi-party interactions. We share practical insights spanning the full development lifecycle to guide practitioners in building reliable, adaptable summarization systems, as well as to inform future research, covering: 1) robust methods for evaluation despite evolving requirements and task subjectivity, 2) component-wise optimization enabled by the task decomposition inherent in an agentic architecture, 3) the impact of upstream data bottlenecks, and 4) the realities of vendor lock-in due to the poor transferability of LLM prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的文本转SQL方法在提示中包含大量数据库模式，导致上下文长、预填充延迟增加，且现有推理引擎处理用户查询时生成冗余前缀缓存副本。

Method: 离线预计算表表示作为KV缓存并在线查询所需缓存，计算表缓存时保留表间主键外键关系，构建Table Trie结构进行高效KV缓存查找，引入带查询重排序策略的缓存管理系统和计算加载流水线。

Result: 提出的TableCache在Time to First Token (TTFT)上实现了高达3.62倍的加速，且性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 所提出的TableCache方法能有效提升文本转SQL任务的推理速度，且对性能影响极小。

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL tasks, existing LLM-based methods often include extensive database schemas in prompts, leading to long context lengths and increased prefilling latency. While user queries typically focus on recurrent table sets-offering an opportunity for KV cache sharing across queries-current inference engines, such as SGLang and vLLM, generate redundant prefix cache copies when processing user queries with varying table orders. To address this inefficiency, we propose precomputing table representations as KV caches offline and querying the required ones online. A key aspect of our approach is the computation of table caches while preserving primary foreign key relationships between tables. Additionally, we construct a Table Trie structure to facilitate efficient KV cache lookups during inference. To enhance cache performance, we introduce a cache management system with a query reranking strategy to improve cache hit rates and a computation loading pipeline for parallelizing model inference and cache loading. Experimental results show that our proposed TableCache achieves up to a 3.62x speedup in Time to First Token (TTFT) with negligible performance degradation.

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，ACE在准确性上显著优于对比基线，且能有效消耗令牌。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂知识密集型任务的上下文进化生成提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Current context augmentation methods, such as retrieval-augmented generation, are essential for solving knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.However, they typically adhere to a rigid, brute-force strategy that executes retrieval at every step. This indiscriminate approach not only incurs unnecessary computational costs but also degrades performance by saturating the context with irrelevant noise. To address these limitations, we introduce Agentic Context Evolution (ACE), a framework inspired by human metacognition that dynamically determines whether to seek new evidence or reason with existing knowledge. ACE employs a central orchestrator agent to make decisions strategically via majority voting.It aims to alternate between activating a retriever agent for external retrieval and a reasoner agent for internal analysis and refinement. By eliminating redundant retrieval steps, ACE maintains a concise and evolved context. Extensive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in accuracy while achieving efficient token consumption.Our work provides valuable insights into advancing context-evolved generation for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: 效用加权校准可通过减少约束条件约束频率防止高摩擦环境下过度自信预测的失败。

Abstract: Forecasting accuracy is routinely optimised in financial prediction tasks even though investment and risk-management decisions are executed under transaction costs, market impact, capacity limits, and binding risk constraints. This paper treats forecasting as an econometric input to a constrained decision problem. A predictive distribution induces a decision rule through a utility objective combined with an explicit friction operator consisting of both a cost functional and a feasible-set constraint system. The econometric target becomes minimisation of expected decision loss net of costs rather than minimisation of prediction error. The paper develops a utility-weighted calibration criterion aligned to the decision loss and establishes sufficient conditions under which calibrated predictive distributions weakly dominate uncalibrated alternatives. An empirical study using a pre-committed nested walk-forward protocol on liquid equity index futures confirms the theory: the proposed utility-weighted calibration reduces realised decision loss by over 30\% relative to an uncalibrated baseline ($t$-stat -30.31) for loss differential and improves the Sharpe ratio from -3.62 to -2.29 during a drawdown regime. The mechanism is identified as a structural reduction in the frequency of binding constraints (from 16.0\% to 5.1\%), preventing the "corner solution" failures that characterize overconfident forecasts in high-friction environments.

Conclusion: 所提方法为样本选择下因果推断提供统一、稳健且计算上有吸引力的框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Riesz representation framework to causal inference under sample selection, where both treatment assignment and outcome observability are non-random. Formulating the problem in terms of a Riesz representer enables stable estimation and a transparent decomposition of omitted variable bias into three interpretable components: a data-identified scale factor, outcome confounding strength, and selection confounding strength. For estimation, we employ the ForestRiesz estimator, which accounts for selective outcome observability while avoiding the instability associated with direct propensity score inversion. We assess finite-sample performance through a simulation study and show that conventional double machine learning approaches can be highly sensitive to tuning parameters due to their reliance on inverse probability weighting, whereas the ForestRiesz estimator delivers more stable performance by leveraging automatic debiased machine learning. In an empirical application to the gender wage gap in the U.S., we find that our ForestRiesz approach yields larger treatment effect estimates than a standard double machine learning approach, suggesting that ignoring sample selection leads to an underestimation of the gender wage gap. Sensitivity analysis indicates that implausibly strong unobserved confounding would be required to overturn our results. Overall, our approach provides a unified, robust, and computationally attractive framework for causal inference under sample selection.

Motivation: 利用接近Delaunay三角剖分的预测三角剖分G，更快速地计算正确的Delaunay三角剖分DT(P)。

Method: 提出多种算法，包括确定性算法和随机算法，在不同参数设定下进行计算。

Conclusion: 研究成果有望开启未来富有成效的研究方向。

Abstract: We investigate algorithms with predictions in computational geometry, specifically focusing on the basic problem of computing 2D Delaunay triangulations. Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a triangulation $G$ that serves as a "prediction" of the Delaunay triangulation, we would like to use $G$ to compute the correct Delaunay triangulation $\textit{DT}(P)$ more quickly when $G$ is "close" to $\textit{DT}(P)$. We obtain a variety of results of this type, under different deterministic and probabilistic settings, including the following: 1. Define $D$ to be the number of edges in $G$ that are not in $\textit{DT}(P)$. We present a deterministic algorithm to compute $\textit{DT}(P)$ from $G$ in $O(n + D\log^3 n)$ time, and a randomized algorithm in $O(n+D\log n)$ expected time, the latter of which is optimal in terms of $D$. 2. Let $R$ be a random subset of the edges of $\textit{DT}(P)$, where each edge is chosen independently with probability $ρ$. Suppose $G$ is any triangulation of $P$ that contains $R$. We present an algorithm to compute $\textit{DT}(P)$ from $G$ in $O(n\log\log n + n\log(1/ρ))$ time with high probability. 3. Define $d_{\mbox{\scriptsize\rm vio}}$ to be the maximum number of points of $P$ strictly inside the circumcircle of a triangle in $G$ (the number is 0 if $G$ is equal to $\textit{DT}(P)$). We present a deterministic algorithm to compute $\textit{DT}(P)$ from $G$ in $O(n\log^*n + n\log d_{\mbox{\scriptsize\rm vio}})$ time. We also obtain results in similar settings for related problems such as 2D Euclidean minimum spanning trees, and hope that our work will open up a fruitful line of future research.

### [229] [Lower Bounds for Dominating Set in Ball Graphs and for Weighted Dominating Set in Unit-Ball Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08425)
*Mark de Berg,Sándor Kisfaludi-Bak*

TL;DR: 经典图问题在单位球图上可亚指数时间求解，某些推广结果已得到，本文证明支配集问题在一些图上不太可能有类似推广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究支配集问题在不同类型图上是否能像独立集等问题一样有亚指数时间算法的推广。

Method: 基于指数时间假设（ETH）进行证明。

Result: 证明了支配集问题在三维非单位球图、三维单位球图的加权版本、平面任意凸对象交集图上不存在 $2^{o(n)}$ 时间复杂度的算法。

Conclusion: 支配集问题在这些图上不太可能有像独立集等问题那样的亚指数时间算法推广。

Abstract: Recently it was shown that many classic graph problems -- Independent Set, Dominating Set, Hamiltonian Cycle, and more -- can be solved in subexponential time on unit-ball graphs. More precisely, these problems can be solved in $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ time on unit-ball graphs in $\mathbb R^d$, which is tight under ETH. The result can be generalized to intersection graphs of similarly-sized fat objects. For Independent Set the same running time can be achieved for non-similarly-sized fat objects, and for the weighted version of the problem. We show that such generalizations most likely are not possible for Dominating Set: assuming ETH, we prove that - there is no algorithm with running time $2^{o(n)}$ for Dominating Set on (non-unit) ball graphs in $\mathbb R^3$; - there is no algorithm with running time $2^{o(n)}$ for Weighted Dominating Set on unit-ball graphs in $\mathbb R^3$; - there is no algorithm with running time $2^{o(n)}$ for Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, or Steiner Tree on intersections graphs of arbitrary convex (but non-constant-complexity) objects in the plane.

TL;DR: 研究多元相关数据在Wasserstein - p距离下的中心极限定理（CLT）速率，针对局部相关序列和几何遍历马尔可夫链两种依赖结构得出最优速率，还得到多元U统计量的最优速率，有新的技术工具。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限时间中心极限定理速率在现代机器学习中至关重要，本文研究多元相关数据在Wasserstein - p距离下的CLT速率。

Method: 推导适合研究相关数据的W_1高斯近似误差的辅助界，证明几何遍历链的分裂链再生时间有几何尾部。

Result: 在W_1中得到最优的O(n^(-1/2))速率，在温和矩假设下得到W_p (p≥2) CLT速率，改进已知界限，还得到多元U统计量的最优W_1 - CLT速率。

Conclusion: 新的技术工具对研究相关数据有独立价值，能得出最优W_1速率和W_p (p≥2)结果。

Abstract: Finite-time central limit theorem (CLT) rates play a central role in modern machine learning (ML). In this paper, we study CLT rates for multivariate dependent data in Wasserstein-$p$ ($\mathcal W_p$) distance, for general $p\ge 1$. We focus on two fundamental dependence structures that commonly arise in ML: locally dependent sequences and geometrically ergodic Markov chains. In both settings, we establish the \textit{first optimal} $\mathcal O(n^{-1/2})$ rate in $\mathcal W_1$, as well as the first $\mathcal W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) CLT rates under mild moment assumptions, substantially improving the best previously known bounds in these dependent-data regimes. As an application of our optimal $\mathcal W_1$ rate for locally dependent sequences, we further obtain the first optimal $\mathcal W_1$--CLT rate for multivariate $U$-statistics.
  On the technical side, we derive a tractable auxiliary bound for $\mathcal W_1$ Gaussian approximation errors that is well suited to studying dependent data. For Markov chains, we further prove that the regeneration time of the split chain associated with a geometrically ergodic chain has a geometric tail without assuming strong aperiodicity or other restrictive conditions. These tools may be of independent interests and enable our optimal $\mathcal W_1$ rates and underpin our $\mathcal W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) results.

Motivation: 研究具有独立同分布无序性的纯和混合球形p - 自旋模型的自由能特性。

Method: 引入尾适应归一化方法，分析不同尾指数情况。

Result: 得到纯模型在亚临界、临界和超临界状态下自由能的性质，扩展结果到混合模型并得到TAP型变分表示。

Conclusion: 给出了淬灭自由能跨尾指数和混合情况的统一普适性分类。

Abstract: We study the free energy for pure and mixed spherical $p$-spin models with i.i.d.\ disorder. In the mixed case, each $p$-interaction layer is assumed either to have regularly varying tails with exponent $α_p$ or to satisfy a finite $2p$-th moment condition.
  For the pure spherical $p$-spin model with regularly varying disorder of tail index $α$, we introduce a tail-adapted normalization that interpolates between the classical Gaussian scaling and the extreme-value scale, and we prove a sharp universality dichotomy for the quenched free energy. In the subcritical regime $α<2p$, the thermodynamics is driven by finitely many extremal couplings and the free energy converges to a non-degenerate random limit described by the NIM (non-intersecting monomial) model, depending only on extreme-order statistics. At the critical exponent $α=2p$, we obtain a random one-dimensional TAP-type variational formula capturing the coexistence of an extremal spike and a universal Gaussian bulk on spherical slices. In the supercritical regime $α>2p$ (more generally, under a finite $2p$-th moment assumption), the free energy is universal and agrees with the deterministic Crisanti--Sommers/Parisi value of the corresponding Gaussian model, as established in [Sawhney-Sellke'24].
  We then extend the subcritical and critical results to mixed spherical models in which each $p$-layer is either heavy-tailed with $α_p\le 2p$ or has finite $2p$-th moment. In particular, we derive a TAP-type variational representation for the mixed model, yielding a unified universality classification of the quenched free energy across tail exponents and mixtures.

Method: 提出SDP协议，定义如何将异构无线信号映射到统一感知数据块模式，有CP - ALS池化阶段，建立统一基准用于不同任务。

Result: 在跨用户分裂实验中，SDP显著降低种子间方差（约88%），保持有竞争力的准确率和延迟。

Conclusion: SDP可作为多模态和多任务传感研究的可重复基础，有重要价值。

Abstract: Wireless sensing has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent environments, supporting applications such as human detection, activity recognition, localization, and vital sign monitoring. Despite rapid advances, existing datasets and pipelines remain fragmented across sensing modalities, hindering fair comparison, transfer, and reproducibility. We propose the Sensing Dataset Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level specification and benchmark framework for large-scale wireless sensing. SDP defines how heterogeneous wireless signals are mapped into a unified perception data-block schema through lightweight synchronization, frequency-time alignment, and resampling, while a Canonical Polyadic-Alternating Least Squares (CP-ALS) pooling stage provides a task-agnostic representation that preserves multipath, spectral, and temporal structures. Built upon this protocol, a unified benchmark is established for detection, recognition, and vital-sign estimation with consistent preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Experiments under the cross-user split demonstrate that SDP significantly reduces variance (approximately 88%) across seeds while maintaining competitive accuracy and latency, confirming its value as a reproducible foundation for multi-modal and multitask sensing research.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在采样和贝叶斯推理任务中具有高效性和有效性。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann densities based on a probability-flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) derived from linear stochastic interpolants. The key innovation of our approach is the use of a sequence of Langevin samplers to enable efficient simulation of the flow. Specifically, these Langevin samplers are employed (i) to generate samples from the interpolant distribution at intermediate times and (ii) to construct, starting from these intermediate times, a robust estimator of the velocity field governing the flow ODE. For both applications of the Langevin diffusions, we establish convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on challenging multimodal distributions across a range of dimensions, as well as its effectiveness in Bayesian inference tasks.

Result: 数值实验表明，相比标准LBFGS，MP - LBFGS能提高收敛速度和模型精度，同时减少通信开销。

Conclusion: MP - LBFGS是训练FBPINNs更有效的算法，具有更好性能和较低通信代价。

Abstract: A multi-preconditioned LBFGS (MP-LBFGS) algorithm is introduced for training finite-basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs). The algorithm is motivated by the nonlinear additive Schwarz method and exploits the domain-decomposition-inspired additive architecture of FBPINNs, in which local neural networks are defined on subdomains, thereby localizing the network representation. Parallel, subdomain-local quasi-Newton corrections are then constructed on the corresponding local parts of the architecture. A key feature is a novel nonlinear multi-preconditioning mechanism, in which subdomain corrections are optimally combined through the solution of a low-dimensional subspace minimization problem. Numerical experiments indicate that MP-LBFGS can improve convergence speed, as well as model accuracy over standard LBFGS while incurring lower communication overhead.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are the most lethal diseases of the aorta. The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.

Method: 提出基于NTRU的密钥扩展方法并应用于匿名证书方案。

Result: 所提密钥扩展方法比密钥对生成效率显著提高。

Conclusion: 提出的密钥扩展方法可行且高效。

Abstract: NTRU is one of the important lattice-based post-quantum cryptography methods, offering resistance against quantum computing attacks. However, a drawback of NTRU lies in its relatively low efficiency in generating key pairs. Therefore, this study proposes an NTRU-based key expansion method that enables efficient public key expansion. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to an anonymous certificate scheme, allowing an end entity to generate a key pair only once, after which the certificate authority can expand multiple distinct public keys for anonymity. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed key expansion method achieves significantly higher efficiency than key pair generation.

Method: 开发自动化数据生成流程，构建含3757个代码导向测试用例的数据集，对六个大语言模型进行研究。

Result: 表情符号语义混淆普遍存在，平均混淆率超38%，超90%混淆响应产生“静默失败”，该漏洞易转移到流行代理框架，现有基于提示的缓解方法大多无效。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区认识此新兴漏洞，开发有效缓解方法维护大语言模型系统的安全和可靠性。

Abstract: Emoticons are widely used in digital communication to convey affective intent, yet their safety implications for Large Language Models (LLMs) remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify emoticon semantic confusion, a vulnerability where LLMs misinterpret ASCII-based emoticons to perform unintended and even destructive actions. To systematically study this phenomenon, we develop an automated data generation pipeline and construct a dataset containing 3,757 code-oriented test cases spanning 21 meta-scenarios, four programming languages, and varying contextual complexities. Our study on six LLMs reveals that emoticon semantic confusion is pervasive, with an average confusion ratio exceeding 38%. More critically, over 90% of confused responses yield 'silent failures', which are syntactically valid outputs but deviate from user intent, potentially leading to destructive security consequences. Furthermore, we observe that this vulnerability readily transfers to popular agent frameworks, while existing prompt-based mitigations remain largely ineffective. We call on the community to recognize this emerging vulnerability and develop effective mitigation methods to uphold the safety and reliability of the LLM system.

Result: 现有防御机制在实际金融代理场景效果差，最先进模型攻击成功率达50%，最稳健系统也有6.7%。

Conclusion: 当前安全设计可移植性有限，需更强的金融特定防御措施。

Abstract: Financial agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for investment analysis, risk assessment, and automated decision-making, where their abilities to plan, invoke tools, and manipulate mutable state introduce new security risks in high-stakes and highly regulated financial environments. However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses.

Conclusion: 为评估身份安全中的代理AI系统提供实用且可重复的基准，为未来更高级的ISPM基准奠定基础。

Abstract: Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) is a core challenge for modern enterprises operating across cloud and SaaS environments. Answering basic ISPM visibility questions, such as understanding identity inventory and configuration hygiene, requires interpreting complex identity data, motivating growing interest in agentic AI systems. Despite this interest, there is currently no standardized way to evaluate how well such systems perform ISPM visibility tasks on real enterprise data. We introduce the Sola Visibility ISPM Benchmark, the first benchmark designed to evaluate agentic AI systems on foundational ISPM visibility tasks using a live, production-grade identity environment spanning AWS, Okta, and Google Workspace. The benchmark focuses on identity inventory and hygiene questions and is accompanied by the Sola AI Agent, a tool-using agent that translates natural-language queries into executable data exploration steps and produces verifiable, evidence-backed answers. Across 77 benchmark questions, the agent achieves strong overall performance, with an expert accuracy of 0.84 and a strict success rate of 0.77. Performance is highest on AWS hygiene tasks, where expert accuracy reaches 0.94, while results on Google Workspace and Okta hygiene tasks are more moderate, yet competitive. Overall, this work provides a practical and reproducible benchmark for evaluating agentic AI systems in identity security and establishes a foundation for future ISPM benchmarks covering more advanced identity analysis and governance tasks.

Motivation: 现有入侵（后门）指纹存在触发词易过滤、响应模式易暴露、在良性输入上有虚假激活等问题。

Method: 构建键值对集合，训练轻量级LoRA适配器抑制原值，在黑/灰盒访问下通过聚合证据计算指纹成功率来验证所有权。

Result: 在不同架构和设置下，对指纹模型实现100%所有权验证，保持标准性能，在隐蔽性和对模型合并的鲁棒性上超过后门基线，在适度增量微调下仍有效。

Conclusion: ForgetMark依赖概率性遗忘痕迹，避免了现有指纹的问题，能有效实现所有权验证。

Abstract: Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型黑盒部署下IP保护成问题，现有的基于后门的指纹方法存在缺陷。

Method: 提出DNF方法，通过将特定领域风格线索与隐式语义触发器相结合来嵌入分层后门。

Result: 在多个模型上实现完美指纹激活，保留下游效用，使用更低困惑度触发器，在指纹检测攻击下不可检测，对增量微调与模型合并有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DNF是大语言模型所有权验证和IP保护的实用、隐蔽且有韧性的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.

  Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change.
  Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered).
  Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，得出对未来QST实证研究设计、执行和报告的见解与建议。

Abstract: In quantum software engineering (QSE), quantum software testing (QST) has attracted increasing attention as quantum software systems grow in scale and complexity. Since QST evaluates quantum programs through execution under designed test inputs, empirical studies are widely used to assess the effectiveness of testing approaches. However, the design and reporting of empirical studies in QST remain highly diverse, and a shared methodological understanding has yet to emerge, making it difficult to interpret results and compare findings across studies. This paper presents a methodological analysis of empirical studies in QST through a systematic examination of 59 primary studies identified from a literature pool of size 384. We organize our analysis around ten research questions that cover key methodological dimensions of QST empirical studies, including objects under test, baseline comparison, testing setup, experimental configuration, and tool and artifact support. Through cross-study analysis along these dimensions, we characterize current empirical practices in QST, identify recurring limitations and inconsistencies, and highlight open methodological challenges. Based on our findings, we derive insights and recommendations to inform the design, execution, and reporting of future empirical studies in QST.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to enhance perceptual and decision-making capabilities by integrating information from diverse sources. However, classical deep learning approaches face a critical trade-off between the high accuracy of black-box feature-level fusion and the interpretability of less outstanding decision-level fusion, alongside the challenges of parameter explosion and complexity. This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction. By leveraging the strong expressive power of quantum, we have reduced the complexity of multimodal fusion and post-processing to linear, and the fusion process also possesses the interpretability of decision-level fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves classification accuracy comparable to classical networks with dozens of times of parameters, exhibiting notable stability and performance across multimodal image datasets.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) emerges as a powerful technique that combines quantum computing with federated learning to efficiently process complex data across distributed quantum devices while ensuring data privacy in quantum networks. Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Automated theorem proving, or more broadly automated reasoning, aims at using computer programs to automatically prove or disprove mathematical theorems and logical statements. It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity. In addition, we propose the quantum algebraic proving method for geometric theorems, extending Wu's algebraic approach beyond the classical setting. Through concrete examples, including geometry problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, we demonstrate how a quantum computer may prove geometric theorems with quadratic better query complexity. Our results establish a primary approach towards building quantum automatic theorem provers, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies.

Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.

Abstract: While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\cos(\bmω^{\top}Δ\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy.

Abstract: Information access systems such as search engines and generative AI are central to how people seek, evaluate, and interpret information. Yet most systems are designed to optimise retrieval rather than to help users develop better search strategies or critical awareness. This paper introduces a pedagogical perspective on information access, conceptualising search and conversational systems as instructive interfaces that can teach, guide, and scaffold users' learning. We draw on seven didactic frameworks from education and behavioural science to analyse how existing and emerging system features, including query suggestions, source labels, and conversational or agentic AI, support or limit user learning. Using two illustrative search tasks, we demonstrate how different design choices promote skills such as critical evaluation, metacognitive reflection, and strategy transfer. The paper contributes a conceptual lens for evaluating the instructional value of information access systems and outlines design implications for technologies that foster more effective, reflective, and resilient information seekers.

Abstract: Personality traits influence how individuals engage, behave, and make decisions during the information-seeking process. However, few studies have linked personality to observable search behaviors. This study aims to characterize personality traits through a multimodal time-series model that integrates eye-tracking data and gaze missingness-periods when the user's gaze is not captured. This approach is based on the idea that people often look away when they think, signaling disengagement or reflection. We conducted a user study with 25 participants, who used an interactive application on an iPad, allowing them to engage with digital artifacts from a museum. We rely on raw gaze data from an eye tracker, minimizing preprocessing so that behavioral patterns can be preserved without substantial data cleaning. From this perspective, we trained models to predict personality traits using gaze signals. Our results from a five-fold cross-validation study demonstrate strong predictive performance across all five dimensions: Neuroticism (Macro F1 = 77.69%), Conscientiousness (74.52%), Openness (77.52%), Agreeableness (73.09%), and Extraversion (76.69%). The ablation study examines whether the absence of gaze information affects the model performance, demonstrating that incorporating missingness improves multimodal time-series modeling. The full model, which integrates both time-series signals and missingness information, achieves 10-15% higher accuracy and macro F1 scores across all Big Five traits compared to the model without time-series signals and missingness. These findings provide evidence that personality can be inferred from search-related gaze behavior and demonstrate the value of incorporating missing gaze data into time-series multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Video is a powerful medium for communication and storytelling, yet reauthoring existing footage remains challenging. Even simple edits often demand expertise, time, and careful planning, constraining how creators envision and shape their narratives. Recent advances in generative AI suggest a new paradigm: what if editing a video were as straightforward as rewriting text? To investigate this, we present a tech probe and a study on text-driven video reauthoring. Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm. Our work contributes empirical insights into the opportunities and challenges of text-driven video reauthoring, offering design implications for future co-creative video tools.

Abstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in higher education, it increasingly shapes how students complete academic tasks. While these systems offer efficiency and support, concerns persist regarding over-automation, diminished student agency, and the potential for unreliable or hallucinated outputs. This study conducts a mixed-methods audit of student-AI collaboration preferences by examining the alignment between current AI capabilities and students' desired levels of automation in academic work. Using two sequential and complementary surveys, we capture students' perceived benefits, risks, and preferred boundaries when using AI. The first survey employs an existing task-based framework to assess preferences for and actual usage of AI across 12 academic tasks, alongside primary concerns and reasons for use. The second survey, informed by the first, explores how AI systems could be designed to address these concerns through open-ended questions. This study aims to identify gaps between existing AI affordances and students' normative expectations of collaboration, informing the development of more effective and trustworthy AI systems for education.

Abstract: The development of the state-of-the-art telescopic systems capable of performing expansive sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Euclid, and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) has significantly advanced efforts to refine cosmological models. These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document. Evaluation metrics include catastrophic outlier, bias, and rms.

Abstract: Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is increasingly gathering attention with the aim of monitoring sea life and deep ocean environment, underwater surveillance as well as maintenance of underwater installments. However, conventional IoUT devices, reliant on battery power, face limitations in lifespan and pose environmental hazards upon disposal. This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. The results elucidate that the proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling structurally heterogeneous teams of agents to jointly discover and acquire randomly located targets in environments characterized by partial observability, communication constraints, and dynamic interactions. Each agent's policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate safe and stable task execution, confirming the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.

TL;DR: 提出用机器学习从咳嗽音频和临床数据自动检测结核病的标准化框架，建立可复现基线，促进公平比较。

Conclusion: 该基线可作为共同参考点，减少阻碍该领域进展的方法差异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a standardized framework for automatic tuberculosis (TB) detection from cough audio and routinely collected clinical data using machine learning. While TB screening from audio has attracted growing interest, progress is difficult to measure because existing studies vary substantially in datasets, cohort definitions, feature representations, model families, validation protocols, and reported metrics. Consequently, reported gains are often not directly comparable, and it remains unclear whether improvements stem from modeling advances or from differences in data and evaluation. We address this gap by establishing a strong, well-documented baseline for TB prediction using cough recordings and accompanying clinical metadata from a recently compiled dataset from several countries. Our pipeline is reproducible end-to-end, covering feature extraction, multimodal fusion, cougher-independent evaluation, and uncertainty quantification, and it reports a consistent suite of clinically relevant metrics to enable fair comparison. We further quantify performance for cough audio-only and fused (audio + clinical metadata) models, and release the full experimental protocol to facilitate benchmarking. This baseline is intended to serve as a common reference point and to reduce methodological variance that currently holds back progress in the field.

TL;DR: 本文提出DINO - AugSeg框架解决少样本医学图像分割挑战，经多模态数据集验证效果佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在少样本医学图像分割因标注数据少面临挑战，自监督基础模型DINOv3虽有潜力但存在领域差异。

Method: 提出DINO - AugSeg框架，引入WT - Aug模块增强特征多样性，CG - Fuse模块融合高低分辨率特征。

Result: 在六种公共基准数据集上，DINO - AugSeg在少样本条件下始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 小波域增强和上下文融合对特征表示有效，DINO - AugSeg是少样本医学图像分割的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging in few-shot scenarios due to the scarcity of annotated training data. Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation. Code and data will be made available on https://github.com/apple1986/DINO-AugSeg.

Conclusion: 提出的方法可有效改进零样本ADL识别。

Abstract: Unobtrusive sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart homes by processing data collected from IoT sensing devices supports applications such as healthcare, safety, and energy management. Recent zero-shot methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the advantage of removing the reliance on labeled ADL sensor data. However, existing approaches rely on time-based segmentation, which is poorly aligned with the contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, existing approaches lack methods for estimating prediction confidence. This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B). The proposed confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调DNN时标注新输入成本高，现有基于多样性的输入选择方法计算量大、缺乏可扩展性，需更高效方法。

Method: 引入基于视觉语言模型的CBD指标，结合Margin提出混合输入选择方法，并在多种场景下进行综合评估。

Result: CBD与几何多样性（GD）强相关但计算时间大幅减少；CBD-based选择方法在指导输入选择上优于所有基线，且选择时间接近简单的基于不确定性的方法。

Conclusion: CBD-based方法有效、有计算优势，在重复和大规模输入选择场景中可扩展。

Abstract: Maintaining or improving the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through fine-tuning requires labeling newly collected inputs, a process that is often costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this problem, input selection approaches have been developed in recent years to identify small, yet highly informative subsets for labeling. Diversity-based selection is one of the most effective approaches for this purpose. However, they are often computationally intensive and lack scalability for large input sets, limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce Concept-Based Diversity (CBD), a highly efficient metric for image inputs that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM). Our results show that CBD exhibits a strong correlation with Geometric Diversity (GD), an established diversity metric, while requiring only a fraction of its computation time. Building on this finding, we propose a hybrid input selection approach that combines CBD with Margin, a simple uncertainty metric. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of DNN models, input sets, selection budgets, and five most effective state-of-the-art selection baselines. The results demonstrate that the CBD-based selection consistently outperforms all baselines at guiding input selection to improve the DNN model. Furthermore, the CBD-based selection approach remains highly efficient, requiring selection times close to those of simple uncertainty-based methods such as Margin, even on larger input sets like ImageNet. These results confirm not only the effectiveness and computational advantage of the CBD-based approach, particularly compared to hybrid baselines, but also its scalability in repetitive and extensive input selection scenarios.

Motivation: 3D感知系统要应用到实际，模型需适应对象定义和传感器领域的变化，但3D点云感知的连续和迁移学习研究不足，尤其是在领域和标签同时变化时。

Method: 提出ROAD基准，对基于LiDAR的对象分类进行综合评估，使用大规模数据集评估零样本迁移、线性探测和持续学习（CL），分析骨干架构、训练目标和CL方法的影响。

Result: 揭示了现有方法在实际变化下的局限性。

Conclusion: 为未来鲁棒3D感知研究建立了强基线。

Abstract: For 3D perception systems to be practical in real-world applications -- from autonomous driving to embodied AI -- models must adapt to continuously evolving object definitions and sensor domains. Yet, research on continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision -- particularly under simultaneous domain and label shifts. To address this gap, we propose the RObust Autonomous driving under Dataset shifts (ROAD) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for LiDAR-based object classification that explicitly accounts for domain shifts as well as three key forms of label evolution: class split, class expansion, and class insertion. Using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), we evaluate zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and CL, and analyze the impact of backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods. Our findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本条件扩散编辑器在同时引入新对象和新风格时表现不佳。

Method: TP - Blend框架通过CAOF定位对提示有强响应的空间令牌，解决熵正则化最优传输问题更新特征向量；SASF通过细节敏感实例归一化注入风格，分离高低频分量并交换Key和Value矩阵。

Result: TP - Blend能产生高分辨率、逼真的编辑结果，在定量保真度、感知质量和推理速度上超越近期基线。

Conclusion: TP - Blend框架可有效解决同时引入新对象和新风格的问题，具有良好效果。

Abstract: Current text-conditioned diffusion editors handle single object replacement well but struggle when a new object and a new style must be introduced simultaneously. We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.

Our approach addresses the accuracy--efficiency trade-off by delivering high accuracy while maintaining low computational costs, demonstrating its potential for efficient maize disease diagnosis on edge devices in precision farming systems.

Conclusion: 该框架可大幅扩展面部表情及过渡类型，有望得到广泛应用。

Abstract: A 3D avatar typically has one of six cardinal facial expressions. To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/

Abstract: Ruminal acidosis is a prevalent metabolic disorder in dairy cattle causing significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance. Our work establishes the feasibility of gas emission-based livestock health monitoring, paving the way for practical, in vitro acidosis detection systems.

Result: 对Gemma 3中7层的数百个概念应用该方法，合成图像常描绘目标文本概念的显著视觉特征，如第1层超50%图像有可识别特征。

Conclusion: 方法为图像 - 文本对齐提供概念和层层面的直接、建设性证据，简单快速，无需辅助模型或数据集，还为模型可解释性提供新途径。

Abstract: We show that for a variety of concepts in adapter-based vision-language models, the representations of their images and their text descriptions are meaningfully aligned from the very first layer. This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as "Jupiter", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets. It also offers a new path towards model interpretability, by providing a way to visualise a model's representation space by backtracing through its image processing components.

Conclusion: FigEx2能有效应对科学复合图面板级理解问题，性能出色且具有迁移潜力。

Abstract: Scientific compound figures combine multiple labeled panels into a single image, but captions in real pipelines are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult. In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data quality plays a central role in the performance and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.

Conclusion: 胶囊架构方法适用于不同领域的单样本识别任务。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in the computer vision community, significantly improving the state-of-the-art. But learning good features often is computationally expensive in machine learning settings and is especially difficult when there is a lack of data. One-shot learning is one such area where only limited data is available. In one-shot learning, predictions have to be made after seeing only one example from one class, which requires special techniques. In this paper we explore different approaches to one-shot identification tasks in different domains including an industrial application and face recognition. We use a special technique with stacked images and use siamese capsule networks. It is encouraging to see that the approach using capsule architecture achieves strong results and exceeds other techniques on a wide range of datasets from industrial application to face recognition benchmarks while being easy to use and optimise.

Conclusion: Geo - NVS - w是用于野外新视图合成的可靠方法，能产生具有清晰、几何连贯细节的逼真结果。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-NVS-w, a geometry-aware framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis from unstructured, in-the-wild image collections. While existing in-the-wild methods already excel at novel view synthesis, they often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, sometimes producing results that contain inconsistencies. Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.

Motivation: 随着遥感数据规模扩大，使用主题产品或众包程序注释会引入多标签噪声，以往工作未区分噪声类型且缺乏适应机制。

Method: 提出NAR方法，在半监督学习框架下区分加性和减性噪声，采用基于置信度的标签处理机制，并与早期学习正则化结合。

Result: 在多种噪声场景实验中，NAR比现有方法持续提高鲁棒性，在减性和混合噪声下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 自适应抑制和选择性纠正噪声监督是遥感多标签分类中抗噪声学习的有效策略。

Abstract: The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.

Method: 提出基于扩散的生成模型Pathogen，利用扩散模型的迭代细化过程合成具有自然组织边界、保留细胞结构和真实染色特征的病变。

Conclusion: 该方法为在有限专家标注数据下开发通用医疗AI系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: The development of robust artificial intelligence models for histopathology diagnosis is severely constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated lesion data, particularly for rare pathologies and underrepresented disease subtypes. While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data.

Conclusion: 该方法在实际道路安全应用中有前景。

Abstract: Distracted driving is a major cause of traffic collisions, calling for robust and scalable detection methods. Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.

Result: SSP框架在实验中表现优于现有AVS方法，分割结果高效准确。

Conclusion: SSP框架能够有效提升AVSS任务的性能，实现高效精准的分割。

Abstract: Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \textit{S}tepping \textit{S}tone \textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型测试时适配（TTA）方法依赖零样本预测作为伪标签，但存在模态差距和视觉干扰问题，导致其在分布偏移下不可靠。

Method: 提出 SubTTA 方法，通过对齐两种模态的语义子空间来增强零样本预测进而更好指导 TTA 进程，包括提取主空间、最小化弦距、投影视觉特征等操作。

Result: 在各种基准和视觉语言模型架构上进行了大量实验，SubTTA 比现有 TTA 方法平均提升 2.24%。

Conclusion: SubTTA 方法能有效解决现有 TTA 方法的局限，提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的适配能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in gastroenterology, yet their performance against comprehensive clinical workflows and human benchmarks remains unverified. To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

Method: 提出放射组学指纹（动态构建患者特定特征集）和健康角色（用扩散模型合成无病理基线）两种策略，并在三个临床任务中对比。

Result: 两种方法性能可比或超越最先进的深度学习模型，支持多层次可解释性。

Conclusion: 这两种策略有助于人类可解释的生物标志物发现和病理定位。

Abstract: For automated assessment of knee MRI scans, both accuracy and interpretability are essential for clinical use and adoption. Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation.

Result: 在多个去学习任务中，SafeRedir有效去学习，保留语义和感知，图像质量好，抗攻击能力强，且在多种扩散架构和现有去学习模型中有效泛化。

Conclusion: SafeRedir是轻量级、有效且具有广泛适用性和兼容性的推理时框架。

Abstract: Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ryliu68/SafeRedir.

Conclusion: HIPPO框架能有效解决现有视频大语言模型投机解码方法的局限，实现显著的推理加速。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.

Result: 在KADID、KonIQ、LIVE Challenge和SPAQ等IQA数据集上实验，IQARAG有效提升LMMs的IQA性能。

Conclusion: IQARAG提供了一种资源高效的替代微调的质量评估方法。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently shown remarkable promise in low-level visual perception tasks, particularly in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), demonstrating strong zero-shot capability. However, achieving state-of-the-art performance often requires computationally expensive fine-tuning methods, which aim to align the distribution of quality-related token in output with image quality levels. Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: IGAN模型能平衡训练稳定性和图像生成质量，是高保真图像合成的可扩展且计算高效的框架。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.

Abstract: Objectives: To overcome challenges in diagnosing pericoronitis on panoramic radiographs, an AI-assisted assessment system integrating anatomical localization, pathological classification, and interpretability. Methods: A two-stage deep learning pipeline was implemented. The first stage used YOLOv8 to detect third molars and classify their anatomical positions and angulations based on Winter's classification. Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis. Radiologists reported 84% alignment between Grad-CAM and their diagnostic impressions, supporting the radiographic relevance of the interpretability output. Conclusion: The system shows strong potential for AI-assisted panoramic assessment, with explainable AI features that support clinical confidence.

TL;DR: 提出SDC框架解决FSCIL稳定性 - 可塑性困境，在多数据集达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FSCIL中平衡旧知识保留和新知识获取的稳定性 - 可塑性困境。

Method: 将FSCIL任务分为静态保留阶段（SRS）和动态学习阶段（DLS），SRS保留旧知识，DLS引入动态投影仪结合静态记忆训练。

Result: 在三个公共基准和一个真实应用数据集上实验，优于其他竞争对手。

Conclusion: 所提出的SDC框架能在保留旧知识的同时适应新类，实现了稳定性和可塑性的更好权衡。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously recognize novel classes under limited data, which suffers from the key stability-plasticity dilemma: balancing the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new knowledge. To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors.

Abstract: The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.

Result: 在三个流行基准测试上，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PKI及其变体在少样本类增量学习中表现良好，能平衡资源消耗与性能。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出EfficientFSL框架用于ViT少样本分类，减少计算开销并取得好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型在少样本分类有优势，但微调需大量GPU内存和长时间，不适用于低资源场景。

Method: 引入轻量级可训练Forward Block合成特定任务查询；提出Combine Block融合多层输出；使用Support - Query Attention Block缓解分布偏移。

Result: 在四个域内少样本数据集和六个跨域数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EfficientFSL在减少计算开销的同时有效，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable superiority over smaller architectures like ResNet in few-shot classification, owing to their powerful representational capacity. However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: 提出 CD² 框架，包含数据集蒸馏模块 DDM 和蒸馏约束模块 DCM，DDM 合成浓缩样本，DCM 引入损失约束先前学习的类分布。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的大量实验表明该方法优于其他竞品。

Conclusion: 提出的 CD² 框架能有效促进 FSCIL，可保留更多蒸馏知识。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) receives significant attention from the public to perform classification continuously with a few training samples, which suffers from the key catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing methods usually employ an external memory to store previous knowledge and treat it with incremental classes equally, which cannot properly preserve previous essential knowledge. To solve this problem and inspired by recent distillation works on knowledge transfer, we propose a framework termed \textbf{C}onstrained \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{CD$^2$}) to facilitate FSCIL, which includes a dataset distillation module (\textbf{DDM}) and a distillation constraint module~(\textbf{DCM}). Specifically, the DDM synthesizes highly condensed samples guided by the classifier, forcing the model to learn compacted essential class-related clues from a few incremental samples. The DCM introduces a designed loss to constrain the previously learned class distribution, which can preserve distilled knowledge more sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 在三个7B视频视觉语言模型上，VASE的ROC - AUC最高，嵌入聚类成本低，领域微调减少幻觉但校准改进不大。

Conclusion: VideoHEDGE框架有效，VASE表现突出，嵌入聚类有优势，领域微调有一定作用，提供可复现资源。

Abstract: Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE#videohedge .

Abstract: Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of acute ischemic stroke lesions in MRI is a key component of stroke diagnosis and management. In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully applied to the automatic segmentation of such lesions. While most proposed architectures are based on the U-Net framework, they primarily differ in their choice of loss functions and in the use of deep supervision, residual connections, and attention mechanisms. Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework. We further investigated unsupervised domain adaptation to improve generalization to an external clinical dataset. ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set. Codes and trained models will be made publicly available to facilitate reuse and reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong capabilities in visual-language reasoning, yet their performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery remains largely unexplored. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Histopathology analysis relies on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, but fluorescence microscopy offers complementary information. Converting fluorescence images to H&E-like appearance can aid interpretation and integration with standard workflows. We present a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) approach for unpaired image-to-image translation from multi-channel fluorescence microscopy to pseudo H&E stained histopathology images. The method combines C01 and C02 fluorescence channels into RGB and learns a bidirectional mapping between fluorescence and H&E domains without paired training data. The architecture uses ResNet-based generators with residual blocks and PatchGAN discriminators, trained with adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses. Experiments on fluorescence microscopy datasets show the model generates realistic pseudo H&E images that preserve morphological structures while adopting H&E-like color characteristics. This enables visualization of fluorescence data in a format familiar to pathologists and supports integration with existing H&E-based analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Tracklet quality is often treated as an afterthought in most person re-identification (ReID) methods, with the majority of research presenting architectural modifications to foundational models. Such approaches neglect an important limitation, posing challenges when deploying ReID systems in real-world, difficult scenarios. In this paper, we introduce S3-CLIP, a video super-resolution-based CLIP-ReID framework developed for the VReID-XFD challenge at WACV 2026. The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic investigation of video super-resolution as a means of enhancing tracklet quality for person ReID, particularly under challenging cross-view conditions. Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.

Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.

Conclusion: ENACHI框架能有效优化设备-边缘协同推理，在准确性、能耗和可扩展性方面表现良好。

Abstract: Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.

Abstract: The AI datacenters are currently being deployed on a large scale to support the training and deployment of power-intensive large-language models (LLMs). Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs. Using real Azure inference traces and detailed GPU profiling, our model balances serving latency and thermal constraints in AI datacenters while significantly improving AI datacenters' energy efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频反欺骗领域缺乏能系统改变模型架构、合成管道和生成参数的数据集，阻碍了说话人特定反欺骗和合成源追踪的进展。

Conclusion: 此数据集能实现鲁棒的说话人条件反欺骗和细粒度合成源追踪，可作为实用训练资源和评估套件。

Abstract: Speaker-specific anti-spoofing and synthesis-source tracing are central challenges in audio anti-spoofing. Progress has been hampered by the lack of datasets that systematically vary model architectures, synthesis pipelines, and generative parameters. To address this gap, we introduce LJ-Spoof, a speaker-specific, generatively diverse corpus that systematically varies prosody, vocoders, generative hyperparameters, bona fide prompt sources, training regimes, and neural post-processing. The corpus spans one speakers-including studio-quality recordings-30 TTS families, 500 generatively variant subsets, 10 bona fide neural-processing variants, and more than 3 million utterances. This variation-dense design enables robust speaker-conditioned anti-spoofing and fine-grained synthesis-source tracing. We further position this dataset as both a practical reference training resource and a benchmark evaluation suite for anti-spoofing and source tracing.

TL;DR: 研究自回归语音合成的解码顺序，用掩码扩散框架，发现随机解码顺序影响语音质量，自适应解码优于固定顺序，低比特量化也能支持高质量语音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语音合成通常采用从左到右顺序，但生成顺序是模型可选择的，故研究解码顺序。

Method: 使用掩码扩散框架，通过在恒等和随机排列间插值研究解码顺序影响，比较固定策略和自适应策略，对声学表征进行量化。

Result: 随机解码顺序影响语音质量，固定顺序解码（包括主流从左到右）效果不佳，自适应解码表现更好，1比特量化也可支持较高质量语音。

Conclusion: 自适应解码在语音合成中优于固定顺序解码，低比特量化有一定可行性。

Abstract: Autoregressive speech synthesis often adopts a left-to-right order, yet generation order is a modelling choice. We investigate decoding order through masked diffusion framework, which progressively unmasks positions and allows arbitrary decoding orders during training and inference. By interpolating between identity and random permutations, we show that randomness in decoding order affects speech quality. We further compare fixed strategies, such as \texttt{l2r} and \texttt{r2l} with adaptive ones, such as Top-$K$, finding that fixed-order decoding, including the dominating left-to-right approach, is suboptimal, while adaptive decoding yields better performance. Finally, since masked diffusion requires discrete inputs, we quantise acoustic representations and find that even 1-bit quantisation can support reasonably high-quality speech.

Result: 证明恒等式可推导，猜想的整数系数构成解析核的符号最小实现，极限周期结构在Worpitzky收敛圆盘内确保绝对收敛。

Conclusion: 算法发现的恒等式并非孤立数值现象，而是与经典超几何变换理论紧密相关。

Abstract: We provide a formal analytic proof for a class of non-canonical polynomial continued fractions representing π/4, originally conjectured by the Ramanujan Machine using algorithmic induction [4]. By establishing an explicit correspondence with the ratio of contiguous Gaussian hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b; c; z), we show that these identities can be derived via a discrete sequence of equivalence transformations. We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel. Stability analysis confirms that the resulting limit-periodic structures reside strictly within the Worpitzky convergence disk, ensuring absolute convergence. This work demonstrates that such algorithmically discovered identities are not isolated numerical artifacts, but are deeply rooted in the classical theory of hypergeometric transformations.

Conclusion: 揭示了计算与存储效率的基本权衡，凸显多元编码作为大规模分布式线性代数任务实用解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.

Abstract: The accurate identification and control of spatiotemporal chaos in reaction-diffusion systems remains a grand challenge in chemical engineering, particularly when the underlying catalytic surface possesses complex, unknown topography. In the \textit{Defect Turbulence} regime, system dynamics are governed by topological phase singularities (spiral waves) whose motion couples to manifold curvature via geometric pinning. Conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ReLU or Tanh activations suffer from fundamental \textit{spectral bias}, failing to resolve high-frequency gradients and causing amplitude collapse or phase drift. We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error $ε_{L_2} \approx 1.92 \times 10^{-2}$, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants ($|ΔN_{defects}| < 1$). We solve the ill-posed \textit{inverse pinning problem}, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation $ρ= 0.965$). Training dynamics reveal a distinctive Spectral Phase Transition at epoch $\sim 2,100$, where cooperative minimization of physics and geometry losses drives the solver to Pareto-optimal solutions. This work establishes a new paradigm for Geometric Catalyst Design, offering a mesh-free, data-driven tool for identifying surface heterogeneity and engineering passive control strategies in turbulent chemical reactors.

Abstract: The microscopic origin of soft magnetic properties in amorphous alloys is fundamentally linked to the interplay between local topological disorder and magnetic exchange interactions. In this work, we employ a multiscale Spin-Lattice Dynamics (SLD) approach to investigate the magnetostructural correlations in amorphous Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ nanodisks ($x=35, 50, 65$). By integrating classical molecular dynamics with a generalized magnetic Hamiltonian, we capture the dynamic feedback loop between lattice vibrations and spin precession. Topological analysis via Voronoi tessellation reveals a persistent species-dependent structural heterogeneity: Cobalt atoms preferentially adopt "solid-like" icosahedral packing, forming a rigid structural backbone, whereas Iron atoms exhibit a higher propensity for "liquid-like" disordered environments. We demonstrate that this topological disparity dictates the macroscopic magnetic response. The Cobalt-driven structural stiffness preserves a robust exchange network that maximizes saturation magnetization, while the local disorder inherent to Iron-rich regions introduces exchange fluctuations that act as an intrinsic damping mechanism, delaying magnetic relaxation. These findings provide an atomistic explanation for the stability of ferromagnetic order in Co-Fe metallic glasses and offer a pathway for tuning damping parameters in amorphous spintronic devices through stoichiometric control.

Abstract: Autonomous experimentation holds the potential to accelerate materials development by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with modular robotic platforms to explore extensive combinatorial chemical and processing spaces. Such self-driving laboratories can not only increase the throughput of repetitive experiments, but also incorporate human domain expertise to drive the search towards user-defined objectives, including improved materials performance metrics. We present an autonomous materials synthesis extension to SARA, the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent, utilizing phase information provided by an automated probabilistic phase labeling algorithm to expedite the search for targeted phase regions. By incorporating human input into an expanded SARA-H (SARA with human-in-the-loop) framework, we enhance the efficiency of the underlying reasoning process. Using synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the efficiency of our AI implementation and show that the human input can contribute to significant improvement in sampling efficiency. We conduct experimental active learning campaigns using robotic processing of thin-film samples of several oxide material systems, including Bi$_2$O$_3$, SnO$_x$, and Bi-Ti-O, using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing to synthesize and kinetically trap metastable phases. We showcase the utility of human-in-the-loop autonomous experimentation for the Bi-Ti-O system, where we identify extensive processing domains that stabilize $δ$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ and Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, explore dwell-dependent ternary oxide phase behavior, and provide evidence confirming predictions that cationic substitutional doping of TiO$_2$ with Bi inhibits the unfavorable transformation of the metastable anatase to the ground-state rutile phase. The autonomous methods we have developed enable the discovery of new materials and new understanding of materials synthesis and properties.

Result: 综合实验表明HIT - Leiden性能优越，相比现有方法提速达五个数量级。

Conclusion: HIT - Leiden算法在动态图Leiden社区维护中表现出色，能有效解决现有算法的问题。

Abstract: As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of online social networks has significantly reshaped the way individuals access and engage with information. While these platforms offer unprecedented connectivity, they may foster environments where users are increasingly exposed to homogeneous content and like-minded interactions. Such dynamics are associated with selective exposure and the emergence of filter bubbles, echo chambers, tunnel vision, and polarization, which together can contribute to ideological isolation and raise concerns about information diversity and public discourse. This survey provides a comprehensive computational review of existing studies that define, analyze, quantify, and mitigate ideological isolation in online social networks. We examine the mechanisms underlying content personalization, user behavior patterns, and network structures that reinforce content-exposure concentration and narrowing dynamics. This paper also systematically reviews methodological approaches for detecting and measuring these isolation-related phenomena, covering network-, content-, and behavior-based metrics. We further organize computational mitigation strategies, including network-topological interventions and recommendation-level controls, and discuss their trade-offs and deployment considerations. By integrating definitions, metrics, and interventions across structural/topological, content-based, interactional, and cognitive isolation, this survey provides a unified computational framework. It serves as a reference for understanding and addressing the key challenges and opportunities in promoting information diversity and reducing ideological fragmentation in the digital age.

Abstract: We study optimal transport between probability measures supported on the same finite metric space, where the ground cost is a distance induced by a weighted connected graph. Building on recent work showing that the resulting Kantorovich distance can be expressed as a minimization problem over the set of spanning trees of this underlying graph, we investigate the implications of this reformulation on the construction of an optimal transport plan and a dual potential based on the solution of such an optimization problem. In this setting, we derive an explicit formula for the Kantorovich potential in terms of the imbalanced cumulative mass (a generalization of the cumulative distribution in R) along an optimal spanning tree solving such a minimization problem, under a weak non-degeneracy condition on the pair of measures that guarantees the uniqueness of a dual potential. Our second contribution establishes the existence of an optimal transport plan that can be computed efficiently by a dynamic programming procedure once an optimal spanning tree is known. Finally, we propose a stochastic algorithm based on simulated annealing on the space of spanning trees to compute such an optimal spanning tree. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach for optimal transport on finite metric spaces.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are widely used in imaging and image recognition. Learning such networks from training data leads to the minimization of a non-convex function. This makes the analysis of standard optimization methods such as variants of (stochastic) gradient descent challenging. In this article we study the simplified setting of linear convolutional networks. We show that the gradient flow (to be interpreted as an abstraction of gradient descent) applied to the empirical risk defined via certain loss functions including the square loss always converges to a critical point, under a mild condition on the training data.

Abstract: The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.

Abstract: Generative AI models ought to be useful and safe across cross-cultural contexts. One critical step toward this goal is understanding how AI models adhere to sociocultural norms. While this challenge has gained attention in NLP, existing work lacks both nuance and coverage in understanding and evaluating models' norm adherence. We address these gaps by introducing a taxonomy of norms that clarifies their contexts (e.g., distinguishing between human-human norms that models should recognize and human-AI interactional norms that apply to the human-AI interaction itself), specifications (e.g., relevant domains), and mechanisms (e.g., modes of enforcement). We demonstrate how our taxonomy can be operationalized to automatically evaluate models' norm adherence in naturalistic, open-ended settings. Our exploratory analyses suggest that state-of-the-art models frequently violate norms, though violation rates vary by model, interactional context, and country. We further show that violation rates also vary by prompt intent and situational framing. Our taxonomy and demonstrative evaluation pipeline enable nuanced, context-sensitive evaluation of cultural norm adherence in realistic settings.
