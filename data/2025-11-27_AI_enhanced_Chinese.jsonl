Despite its importance, most applications still rely on standard nozzle designs. This work investigates the influence of nozzle geometry on pressure loss inside the nozzle, a key factor in high-speed printing performance. Design/methodology/approach: We focus on optimizing the nozzle shape to minimize the pressure loss and establish a framework that allows both sim- ple angle-based optimization and more advanced spline-based parametrization. To model the polymer melt flow, we compare two constitutive descriptions commonly employed in the literature: a temperature-dependent, shear-thinning viscous model and an isothermal viscoelastic model. Findings: For the viscous model, the optimal half-opening angle exhibits a strong dependence on the feeding rate, with higher rates favoring half-opening angles near 30\u00b0, whereas lower rates are more efficient at larger angles. In con- trast, the viscoelastic model predicts a weaker dependence of the optimal angle on the feeding rate. For both models, spline-based parametrization yields only marginal improvements over angle optimization in terms of reducing pressure loss. Originality/value: This paper presents a comparative study of FDM nozzle shape optimization using different simulation models. We introduce a flexible optimization framework that accommodates both simple and advanced geomet- ric parametrizations. The results highlight the impact of model choice on the optimal nozzle geometry and provide support for improving nozzle design in high-speed printing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76FDM\u4e2d\u55b7\u5634\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "FDM\u4e2d\u55b7\u5634\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901f\u6253\u5370\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u55b7\u5634\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u538b\u529b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u901f\u6253\u5370\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f18\u5316\u55b7\u5634\u5f62\u72b6\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u538b\u529b\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6e29\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u526a\u5207\u53d8\u7a00\u7c98\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u6e29\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7c98\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18\u534a\u5f00\u53e3\u89d2\u4e0e\u8fdb\u6599\u901f\u7387\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u6837\u6761\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u538b\u529b\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u6bd4\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u55b7\u5634\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u4f18\u55b7\u5634\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901f\u6253\u5370\u55b7\u5634\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration.

Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution.

This is the extended technical report", "summary": "Indexes are critical for efficient data retrieval and updates in modern databases. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of learned indexes, which model the cumulative distribution function of data to predict search positions and accelerate query processing. While learned indexes substantially outperform traditional structures for point lookups, they often suffer from high tail latency, suboptimal range query performance, and inconsistent effectiveness across diverse workloads. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HIRE, a hybrid in-memory index structure designed to deliver efficient performance consistently. HIRE combines the structural and performance robustness of traditional indexes with the predictive power of model-based prediction to reduce search overhead while maintaining worst-case stability. Specifically, it employs (1) hybrid leaf nodes adaptive to varying data distributions and workloads, (2) model-accelerated internal nodes augmented by log-based updates for efficient updates, (3) a nonblocking, cost-driven recalibration mechanism for dynamic data, and (4) an inter-level optimized bulk-loading algorithm accounting for leaf and internal-node errors.

As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime.

SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5148\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ce\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9GPU\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ceSpira\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ce\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u7684\u6574\u6570\u53d6\u503c\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6709\u6548\u6253\u5305\u539f\u751f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u53cc\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Spira\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5f15\u64ce\u5feb1.71\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb2.31\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5feb2.13\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb3.32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Spira\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u5750\u6807\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u5f15\u64ce\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a \"universally effective\" GEO strategy.

A fundamental computational problem in this context is the Tree Containment problem, which asks whether a given phylogenetic network is compatible with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the classical statement of the problem is not robust to poorly supported branches in biological data, possibly leading to false negatives. In an effort to address this, a relaxed version that accounts for uncertainty, called Soft Tree Containment, has been introduced by Bentert, Mal\u00edk, and Weller [SWAT'18]. We present an algorithm that solves Soft Tree Containment in $2^{O(\u0394_T \\cdot k \\cdot \\log(k))} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k = \\operatorname{sw}(\u0393) + \u0394_N$, with $\u0394_T$ and $\u0394_N$ denoting the maximum out-degrees in the tree and the network, respectively, and $\\operatorname{sw}(\u0393)$ denoting the ``scanwidth'' [Berry, Scornavacca, and Weller, SOFSEM'20] of a given tree extension of the network, while $n$ is the input size. Our approach leverages the fact that phylogenetic networks encountered in practice often exhibit low scanwidth, making the problem more tractable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite the widespread application of AMP in US electricity markets, there exists scarce evidence on how firms strategically react to such price-cap-and-penalty regulation: when the price cap rarely leads to penalty mitigation, it is difficult to distinguish whether AMP are an effective deterrent or simply too lax. We investigate their impact on the bids of generation firms, using 2019 data from the New York and New England electricity markets (NYISO, ISO-NE). We employ a regression discontinuity design, which exploits the fact that the price cap with penalty is only activated when a structural index (e.g., congestion, pivotality) exceeds a certain cutoff. By estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of screening activation, we can causally identify successful deterrence of anti-competitive behavior. Around 30-40% of the analyzed bidders per market exhibit a significant strategic response - corresponding to a decrease in maximum bid prices of 4-10 $/MWh to avoid the penalty. However, there is significant heterogeneity between firms, and the regulatory impact on the overall market is not statistically detectable, suggesting lax mitigation thresholds. Using a merit-order simulation, we estimate the welfare impact of more stringent thresholds to lie between 350 and 980 thousand dollars of increased buyer surplus per mitigated hour, with the associated number of mitigated hours being below 33 hours/year. Our results motivate the empirical calibration of mitigation thresholds to improve the efficiency of AMP regulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u7ebd\u7ea6\u548c\u65b0\u82f1\u683c\u5170\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08AMP\uff09\u5bf9\u53d1\u7535\u516c\u53f8\u6295\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u6295\u6807\u8005\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6821\u51c6\u7f13\u89e3\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8AMP\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AMP\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u9650\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u76d1\u7ba1\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u5176\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u65ad\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u9650\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ec5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff08LATE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u52a3\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u7ea630 - 40%\u7684\u6295\u6807\u8005\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u6295\u6807\u4ef7\u683c\u964d\u4f4e4 - 10\u7f8e\u5143/MWh\uff0c\u4f46\u4f01\u4e1a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5927\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5e02\u573a\u76d1\u7ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u7f13\u89e3\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e70\u5bb6\u5269\u4f59\u589e\u52a0350 - 980\u5343\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u6bcf\u5e74\u4f4e\u4e8e33\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u9608\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8AMP\u76d1\u7ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings.

This paper introduces the Quantum Network of Assets (QNA), a density-matrix based framework that embeds cross-asset dependencies into a quantum-information representation. The approach does not assume physical quantum effects but uses the mathematical structure of density operators, entropy, and mutual information to describe market organisation at a structural level.\n  Within this framework we define two structural measures: the Entanglement Risk Index (ERI), which summarises global non-separability and the compression of effective market degrees of freedom, and the Quantum Early-Warning Signal (QEWS), which tracks changes in entropy to detect latent information build-up. These measures reveal dependency geometry that classical covariance-based tools cannot capture.\n  Using NASDAQ-100 data from 2024-2025, we show that quantum entropy displays smoother evolution and clearer regime distinctions than classical entropy, and that ERI rises during periods of structural tightening even when volatility remains low. Around the 2025 US tariff announcement, QEWS shows a marked pre-event increase in structural tension followed by a sharp collapse after the announcement, indicating that structural transitions can precede price movements without implying predictive modelling.\n  QNA therefore provides a structural diagnostic of market fragility, regime shifts, and latent information flow.

Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees.

Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u5927\u7c7b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u9014\u5f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u66f2\u7ebf\u548cECE\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u7406\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u63d2\u8865\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Our results are parameterized in terms of minimum and maximum project costs, which allows us to improve on the mostly negative results found in prior studies, and reduce to the existing multiwinner guarantee when project costs are equal.

Theory and experimental evidence", "categories": ["econ.GN"], "comment": null, "summary": "Contest participants often have strong incentives to engage in cheating. Sanctions serve as a common deterrent against such conduct. Often, other agents on the contestant's team (e.g., a coach of an athlete) or a company (a manager of an R\\&D engineer) have a vested interest in outcomes and can influence the cheating decision. An agency problem arises when only the contestant faces the penalties for cheating. Our theoretical framework examines joint liability, i.e., shifting some responsibility from the contestant to the other agent, as a solution to this agency problem. Equilibrium analysis shows that extending liability reduces cheating if fines are harsh.

This paper introduces a constrained deep learning approach to determine option prices and hedging strategies that minimize the Profit and Loss (P&L) distribution around zero. We employ a single neural network to represent the option price function, with its gradient serving as the hedging strategy, optimized via a loss function enforcing the self-financing portfolio condition. A key challenge arises from the non-smooth nature of option payoffs (e.g., vanilla calls are non-differentiable at-the-money, while digital options are discontinuous), which conflicts with the inherent smoothness of standard neural networks. To address this, we compare unconstrained networks against constrained architectures that explicitly embed the terminal payoff condition, drawing inspiration from PDE-solving techniques. Our framework assumes two tradable assets: the underlying and a liquid call option capturing volatility dynamics. Numerical experiments evaluate the method on simple options with varying non-smoothness, the exotic Equinox option, and scenarios with market jumps for robustness. Results demonstrate superior P&L distributions, highlighting the efficacy of constrained networks in handling realistic payoffs.

However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models.

Several empirical applications based on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility, robustness and practical relevance of the methodology, suggesting its potential for both regulatory and managerial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6570\u6587\u732e\u805a\u7126\u6807\u91cf\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u5143\u98ce\u9669\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u91cf\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u5dee\uff0c\u7f3a\u5931\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5185\u5728\u591a\u5143\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eFaugeras\u548cPag\u00e9s (2024)\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u5143\u98ce\u9669\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u5178\u9891\u7387 - \u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT.

Unlike reweighting methods such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, i.e. particle filters), the EnKF leverages either the linear Gaussian structure of the SSM or an approximation thereof, to maintain diversity of the sampled latent states (the so-called ensemble members) via shifting-based updates. Joint parameter and state inference using an EnKF is typically achieved by augmenting the state vector with the static parameter. In this case, it is assumed that both parameters and states follow a linear Gaussian state-space model, which may be unreasonable in practice. In this paper, we combine the reweighting and shifting methods by replacing the particle filter used in the SMC^2 algorithm of Chopin et al., with the ensemble Kalman filter. Hence, parameter particles are weighted according to the estimated observed-data likelihood from the latest observation computed by the EnKF, and particle diversity is maintained via a resample-move step that targets the marginal parameter posterior under the EnKF. Extensions to the resulting algorithm are proposed, such as the use of a delayed acceptance kernel in the rejuvenation step and incorporation of nonlinear observation models. We illustrate the resulting methodology via several applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u79fb\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06SMC^2\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u96c6\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08EnKF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528EnKF\u65f6\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u9075\u5faa\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SMC^2\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aEnKF\uff0c\u6839\u636eEnKF\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4f3c\u7136\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u91c7\u6837 - \u79fb\u52a8\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ef4\u6301\u7c92\u5b50\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u79fb\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $\u03b5$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $c\u03b5^{-\u03b3}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $\u03b3>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3aDNNs\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5965\u5361\u59c6\u5243\u5200\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49HTMC\u548cResNet\u8303\u6570\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u7cfb\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91caDNNs\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6210\u529f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u7684\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49HTMC\u8303\u6570\u548cResNet\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u754c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5c0f\u5316ResNet\u8303\u6570\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u7535\u8def\uff0cResNets\u662f\u9002\u5e94HTMC\u4f53\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u51f8\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DNNs\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5965\u5361\u59c6\u5243\u5200\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6210\u529f\uff0cResNets\u5728HTMC\u4f53\u5236\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings.

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAragog\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u670d\u52a1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6ce2\u52a8\u4f1a\u4f7f\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u5f88\u5feb\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8def\u7531\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6bcf\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u670d\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad850.0 - 217.0%\uff0c\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u8bf7\u6c42\u7387\u4e0b\u4e2d\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e32.5 - 78.9%\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6700\u6602\u8d35\u914d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Aragog\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u670d\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities.

These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.\n  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.\n  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0OCR\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edfVisionRAG\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u5148\u7684\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u5fc3RAG\u7ba1\u9053\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5bf9\u5e03\u5c40\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u4e22\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5148\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VisionRAG\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7d22\u5f15\u6846\u67b6\u521b\u5efa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u7528\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7d22\u5f15\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u9875\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u7ed9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u7528\u4e92\u53cd\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5065\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "VisionRAG\u6bcf\u9875\u4ec5\u5b58\u50a817\u523027\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u6210\u7ee9\uff0cFinanceBench\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.8051\uff0cTAT DQA\u4e0a\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe0.9629\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0OCR\u3001\u6458\u8981\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and any $\u03b5> 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\\|H-H_k\\|_F \\leq \u03b5\\|H\\|_F$ for $k = O(\\log n \\log(1/\u03b5))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \\emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\\polylog(n, 1/\u03b5)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\\log n \\log(1/\u03b5))$ Hankel matrix $\\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \\emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\\|H - \\widehat{H}\\|_F \\leq O(\\|E\\|_F) + \u03b5\\|H\\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \\emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \\emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem.

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space.

Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.\n  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\\% of errors while deferring 34.5\\% of samples.

T\u00e2tonnement is a fundamental market dynamics, capturing how prices evolve when they are adjusted in proportion of their excess demand. While its convergence to a competitive equilibrium (CE) is well understood in goods markets for broad classes of utilities, no analogous results are known for chore markets.\n  Analyzing t\u00e2tonnement in the chores market presents new challenges. Several elegant structural properties that facilitate convergence in goods markets-such as convexity of the equilibrium price set and monotonicity of excess demand under the t\u00e2tonnement price updates-fail to hold in the chore setting. Consistent with these difficulties, we first show that na\u00efve t\u00e2tonnement diverges. To overcome this, we propose a modified process called relative t\u00e2tonnement, where prices are updated according to normalized excess demand. We prove its convergence to a CE under suitable step-size choices for a broad class of disutility functions, namely continuous, convex, and 1-homogeneous (CCH) disutilities. This class includes many standard forms such as linear and convex CES disutilities. Our proof proceeds by introducing a nonsmooth, nonconvex yet regular objective function-a generalization of the objective in the Eisenberg-Gale-type dual program introduced by [CKMN24].\n  For convex CES disutilities, where disutility is the weighted $p$-norm of the individual chore disutilities for $p \\in (1, \\infty)$, we show that relative t\u00e2tonnement converges to an $\\varepsilon$-CE in $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. This quadratic convergence rate is established by leveraging the polar gauge (or gauge dual) of the disutility function. Finally, following the framework of [AH58], we analyze the stability of CE and provide a complete characterization of local stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u7684t\u00e2tonnement\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355t\u00e2tonnement\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9t\u00e2tonnement\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u51f8CES\u538c\u6076\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u03b5 - \u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "t\u00e2tonnement\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5546\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u7684t\u00e2tonnement\u5b58\u5728\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u7b80\u5355t\u00e2tonnement\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9t\u00e2tonnement\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u538c\u6076\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6781\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bc1\u660e\u51f8CES\u538c\u6076\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u6309[AH58]\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5747\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u5bf9t\u00e2tonnement\u5728\u5408\u9002\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u51f8\u548c1 - \u9f50\u6b21\uff08CCH\uff09\u538c\u6076\u51fd\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u5728\u51f8CES\u538c\u6076\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u4ee5$O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5230\u03b5 - \u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u523b\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5bf9t\u00e2tonnement\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u4e2dt\u00e2tonnement\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u5747\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8fdb\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6536\u76ca\u5927\u5c0f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u5341\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6536\u76ca\u5927\u5c0f\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5e73\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5f88\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals. The functional composition done in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is described. The neural network parameters and evaluation results are given. The application of the developed adaptive model is possible in the management of programs for the reconstruction of such engineering systems as systems of heat, gas, electricity supply, water supply, and drainage, etc.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u7a0b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u91cd\u5efa\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u5f00\u53d1\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u7a0b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u91cd\u5efa\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u70ed\u3001\u6c14\u3001\u7535\u3001\u6c34\u4f9b\u5e94\u548c\u6392\u6c34\u7b49\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC.

At the same time, SVC models have the advantage that they are easily interpretable. They offer a flexible framework for understanding how the relationships between dependent and independent variables vary across space. The most common methods for modelling such data are the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Bayesian Gaussian Process (Bayes-GP). The Bayesian SVC model, which assumes that the coefficients follow Gaussian processes, provides a rigorous approach to account for spatial non-stationarity. However, the computational cost of Bayes-GP models can be prohibitively high when dealing with large datasets or/and when using a large number of covariates, due to the repeated inversion of dense covariance matrices required at each Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration. In this study, we propose an efficient Bayes-GP modeling framework leveraging the Vecchia approximation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The proposed method is applied to a challenging soil pollution data set in Toulouse, France, characterized by a high degree of censorship (two-thirds censored observations) and spatial clustering.

We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation.

The abstract and text were lightly revised in 2025 to comply with arXiv formatting guidelines", "summary": "Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.\n  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.\n  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic.

The principal would like to choose a game that favors one of the players, the social preferences of the players, or the principal's own preferences. Unfortunately, given the potential multiplicity of equilibria, it is conceptually unclear how to tell which of even any two games is better. Oesterheld et al. (2022) propose that we use assumptions about outcome correspondence -- i.e., about how the outcomes of different games relate -- to allow comparisons in some cases. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. From such assumptions we can sometimes deduce that the outcome of one game G' is guaranteed to be better than the outcome of another game G, even if we do not have beliefs about how each of G and G' will be played individually. Following Oesterheld et al., we then call G' a safe improvement on G.\n  In this paper, we study how to derive safe improvement relations. We first show that if we are given a set of games and arbitrary assumptions about outcome correspondence between these games, deriving safe improvement relations is co-NP-complete. We then study the (in)completeness of a natural set of inference rules for outcome correspondence. We show that in general the inference rules are incomplete.

While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop.

However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency.

In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery.

Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.\n  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.\n  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRePS\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5f3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9650\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRestart for Posterior Sampling (RePS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u542f\u91c7\u6837\u601d\u60f3\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6ODE\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u91cd\u542f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cRePS\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "RePS\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth.

Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u58f0\u5b66\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u786e\u7acb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u58f0\u5b66\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4f4e\u6548\u573a\u666f\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u7c7b\uff0cSincHSRNN\u5728AudioMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95%\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5e94\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6307\u660e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u6ce2\u57fa\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines.

For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5207\u7247\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u5207\u7247\uff09\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8bef\u5dee\u5207\u7247\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e3b\u52a8\u5206\u7ec4\u53ef\u80fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u5207\u7247\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\u662f\u5426\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u75282 - 10%\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u5207\u7247\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faICPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6bd4GRPO\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6548\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u71b5\u574d\u7f29\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u540c\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u591a\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u6570\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cICPO\u6bd4GRPO\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Liu"], "title": "Lightweight Model Editing for LLMs to Correct Deprecated API Recommendations", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u752810\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e09\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fc7\u65f6API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165EDAPIBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AdaLoRA\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u4f46\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdaLoRA - L\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\u5e38\u7528\u5230\u8fc7\u65f6API\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u66f4\u65b0API\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u752810\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165EDAPIBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAdaLoRA - L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9aAPI\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "AdaLoRA\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6700\u65b0API\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bAdaLoRA - L\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaLoRA - L\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO.

In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u5316\u8865\u507f\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u6ea2\u51fa\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u8def\u5f84\u5927\u591a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u603b\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8865\u507f\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u8de8\u89c2\u6d4b\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u4ece\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u9075\u5faa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u9012\u5f52\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u516c\u7406\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u4ee5\u56e0\u679c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e3a\u4f8b\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5e72\u6270\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u5316\u80fd\u4ece\u9690\u85cf\u5e72\u6270\u6e20\u9053\u9690\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u62ec\u5f71\u54cd\u8005\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5e72\u6270\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u6216\u5185\u751f\u5e72\u6270\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback.

This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.\n  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.\n  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps.

This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling.

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions.

It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \\textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues. Readability assessment tools, on the other hand, are envisioned as \\textit{quality coaches}, which provide contextual, personalized, and progressive guidance.

This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods.

Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance.

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u4e0e\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65e0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u89e3\u91ca10 - 40%\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates.

Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57dfSNNs\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SNN\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfANNs\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfANNs\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46SNNs\u4e2d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76SNNs\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u68af\u5ea6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u8109\u51b2\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfANNs\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSNN\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u5608\u6742\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\uff0cSNN\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8109\u51b2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses.

Code available at https://github.com/DJ-Fear/walrus_steering", "summary": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations.

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u6d89\u53ca\u4ece\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6eda\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u9009\u62e9\u5728Single - Reset\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5728Repeated - Reset\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.\n  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.\n  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.\n  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.\n  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security.

Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction.

Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps.

We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u6027LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u548cSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u7684L4M\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cd5\u7406\u539f\u5219\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165L4M\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6cd5\u89c4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u53cc\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u88c1\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5305\u62ecGPT - o4 - mini\u3001DeepSeek - V3\u548cClaude 4\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "L4M\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach.

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference.

To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter \u03c3. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7bIsing\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4f2a\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709Ising\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u867d\u7edf\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7bIsing\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6700\u5927\u4f2a\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u8fd0\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3001\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5230\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7bIsing\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest.

This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models.

However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing.

We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures.

In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($\u0394t\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$\u0394t$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $\u0394t$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($\u0394t = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u548cSpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6c34\u5e73\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u57fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaSpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u5c42\u80fd\u529b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6c34\u5e73\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term \"responsible computational foresight\", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state.

However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFANoise\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u901a\u7528\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u9759\u6001\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFANoise\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7840VLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cFANoise\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FANoise\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u566a\u58f0\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\\\ \\href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f00\u5c55\u9996\u6b21LLMs\u8425\u517b\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08RCT\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u7279\u6027\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4ee5RCT\u4e3a\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8425\u517b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5faa\u8bc1\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e3a\u671f\u4e03\u5468\u7684RCT\uff08n = 81\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u65e0LLM\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u996e\u98df\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u589e\u52a0\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5728\u5185\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5185\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence).

The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.\n  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.\n  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7559\u5b66\u54a8\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba1\u6838\u534f\u8bae", "motivation": "\u660e\u786e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u7559\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u5e7b\u89c9\u60c5\u51b5", "method": "\u7528ApplyBoard\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u6253\u5206\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba1\u6838\u534f\u8bae"}}

We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGated KalmaNet (GKA)\u5c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u5728\u56de\u5fc6\u5bfc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548cChebyshev\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5185\u6838\u3002", "result": "GKA\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SSM\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u8d8510%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GKA\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301SSM\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u5b8c\u6574\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces.

Affective computing aims to design intelligent systems that can recognize, evoke, and express human emotions, thereby emulating human emotional intelligence. While previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of this field, there has been limited comprehensive research that encompasses emotion understanding, elicitation, and expression, along with the related challenges. This survey addresses this gap by providing a holistic overview of core components of artificial emotion intelligence. It covers emotion understanding through multimodal data processing, as well as affective cognition, which includes cognitive appraisal, emotion mapping, and adaptive modulation in decision-making, learning, and reasoning.

This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions.

Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u590d\u6742\u96be\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u91cd\u7ec4\u6587\u6863\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u719f\u6089\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u6cd5\u9662\u5bf9\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u5c11\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea61.5%\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad84.36%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFedAPA\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8eWi-Fi CSI\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fWi-Fi\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Wi-Fi CSI\u4f20\u611f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedAPA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7b49\u539f\u578b\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fWi-Fi\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cFedAPA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u9ad89.65%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad89%\uff0cMAE\u964d\u4f4e0.29\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e95.94%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedAPA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Wi-Fi CSI\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

We present a new benchmark dataset, \\textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \\textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \\textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection.

In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management.

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668TDP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bcf\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u5f0f\u542f\u53d1\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDP\uff0c\u5148\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTDP\u8f83\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u9ad811 - 24.8\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "TDP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

A plea to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing.

However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction.

We introduce Musical Score Understanding Benchmark (MSU-Bench), the first large-scale, human-curated benchmark for evaluating score-level musical understanding across both textual (ABC notation) and visual (PDF) modalities. MSU-Bench comprises 1,800 generative question-answer (QA) pairs drawn from works spanning Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and others, organised into four progressive levels of comprehension: Onset Information, Notation & Note, Chord & Harmony, and Texture & Form.

While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns.

Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the \"user-item decoupling\" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments.

Current safety evaluations primarily test for what a model \\textit{can} do - its capabilities - without assessing what it $\\textit{would}$ do if endowed with high-risk capabilities. This leaves a critical blind spot: models may strategically conceal capabilities or rapidly acquire them, while harboring latent inclinations toward misuse. We argue that $\\textbf{propensity}$ - the likelihood of a model to pursue harmful actions if empowered - is a critical, yet underexplored, axis of safety evaluation. We present $\\textbf{PropensityBench}$, a novel benchmark framework that assesses the proclivity of models to engage in risky behaviors when equipped with simulated dangerous capabilities using proxy tools. Our framework includes 5,874 scenarios with 6,648 tools spanning four high-risk domains: cybersecurity, self-proliferation, biosecurity, and chemical security. We simulate access to powerful capabilities via a controlled agentic environment and evaluate the models' choices under varying operational pressures that reflect real-world constraints or incentives models may encounter, such as resource scarcity or gaining more autonomy. Across open-source and proprietary frontier models, we uncover 9 alarming signs of propensity: models frequently choose high-risk tools when under pressure, despite lacking the capability to execute such actions unaided.

DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle.

A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis.

The Branch-and-Bound (B\\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \\ours, a Dynamic \\underline{\\textbf{S}}tratified \\underline{\\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \\underline{\\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \\ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings.

This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6b63\u4ece\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f9b\u5e94\u8d70\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u613f\u666f\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u613f\u666f\u56e0\u805a\u5408\u5668\u65e0\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u5236\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5141\u8bb8\u8ffd\u6eaf\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u6536\u636e\u8bc1\u660e\u805a\u5408\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u9632\u6b62\u6fc0\u52b1\u535a\u5f08\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9501\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u68c0\u67e5\u8ffd\u6eaf\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002"}}

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.\n  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios.

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks.

Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority.

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76MDLMs\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76MDLMs\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790MDLMs\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86MDLMs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMDLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance.

Submitted to ESANN 2026", "summary": "Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting.

Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6CANVAS\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5cUI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u589e\u5f3aVLMs\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CANVAS\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b598\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fee\u6539\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u5177\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807DPC\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u5341\u500d\u4e14\u6d88\u9664\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5982Infidelity\u4f9d\u8d56\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e14\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff08PC\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff08DPC\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e03\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u57284744\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eDPC\u548cPC\u80fd\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DPC\u6307\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0ePC\u4e00\u8d77\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities.

Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap.

However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance.

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation.

However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude.

These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation.

While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa3D\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u6a21\u578bRefTr\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u7ec6\u5316\u5408\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ba1\u72b6\u6811\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u53ca\u5176\u6811\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u6f0f\u68c0\u5f02\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u81f4\u547d\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684Producer - Refiner\u67b6\u6784\uff0cProducer\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u5408\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cRefiner\u5faa\u73af\u7ec6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f62\u6210\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u56fe\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u6811\u56fe\u975e\u6700\u5927\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u5e76\u91cd\u590d\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRefTr\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80SOTA\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "RefTr\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller \u0394 across prompts).

However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faShiftSyncNet\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8f6c\u6362\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709LNL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6ShiftSyncNet\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f6c\u6362\u7f51\u7edcTransNet\u548c\u65f6\u79fb\u6821\u6b63\u7f51\u7edcSyncNet\uff0cSyncNet\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u76f8\u79fb\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cShiftSyncNet\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51fa9.4%\u30016.0%\u548c12.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "ShiftSyncNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u7406\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u660e\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices.

Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model.

We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges.

This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems.

Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration.

The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis.

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval.

MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors.

This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction.

This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation.

However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation.

However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDA - SIP\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u79ef\u5206\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6b65\u9aa4\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DA - SIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6790\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6b65\u957f\u9884\u7b97\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u53d8\u4f53\u548cODE/SDE\u79ef\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u603b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c112.6 - 4.4\u500d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6700\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DA - SIP\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count.

The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement.

We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively.

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u6307\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4ece\u63a9\u7801\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4e09\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u989d\u5916\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks.

We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors.

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.\n  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks.

Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \\r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels.

Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure.

Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition.

Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus.

Code available at https://github.com/AnanthaPadmanaban-KrishnaKumar/semantic-anchors-icl", "summary": "Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy.

However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $\u0394$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $\u0394$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $\u0394$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\\%. $\u0394$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u0394 - NeRF\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf\u5f0fNeRF\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f73\u3001\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u536b\u661f\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u0394 - NeRF\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3001\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u0394 - NeRF\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1130 - 42%\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe43.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u0394 - NeRF\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5f0fNeRF\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically \"sculpts\" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods.

As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\\% to 16\\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\\% to 21. 25\\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy.

However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance.

Our \\textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical \"brain-action\" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\u7684MMD - FUSE\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u6838\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u589e\u5f3aMMD - FUSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u53c2\u4e0b\uff0c\u542b\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u7684MMD - FUSE\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u9a8c\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6838\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u662f\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGridAR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u533a\u6e10\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e03\u5c40\u6307\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "N=4\u65f6\uff0c\u5728T2I - CompBench++\u4e0a\u6bd4Best - of - N (N=8)\u6548\u679c\u9ad814.4%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e25.6%\uff1b\u5728PIE - Bench\u4e0a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u63d0\u534713.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "GridAR\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels.

In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relev\u00e9s. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines.

SI: 47 pages, 37 figures", "summary": "Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86Kaggle\u7ade\u8d5b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c06\u53d7\u83b7\u80dc\u56e2\u961f\u67b6\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5728\u7ebf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b50\u7f51\u683c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u957f\u671f\u6c14\u5019\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53d7Kaggle\u7ade\u8d5b\u83b7\u80dc\u56e2\u961f\u67b6\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5728\u7ebf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67b6\u6784\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u5dee\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u591a\u4e2a\u53d7Kaggle\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f17\u5305\u79bb\u7ebf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406 - AI\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdSGASA\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u5bf9\u6297\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGASA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528SFT\u548cDPO\u5d4c\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSGASA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SGASA\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance.

We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization.

At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages.

A central reason is spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency structure before high-frequency (HF) details, which both causes DF generators to leave HF artifacts and leaves those same artifacts under-exploited by common detectors. To address this gap, we propose Spectral-cONtrastive Audio Residuals (SONAR), a frequency-guided framework that explicitly disentangles an audio signal into complementary representations. An XLSR encoder captures the dominant low-frequency content, while the same cloned path, preceded by learnable SRM, value-constrained high-pass filters, distills faint HF residuals. Frequency cross-attention reunites the two views for long- and short-range frequency dependencies, and a frequency-aware Jensen-Shannon contrastive loss pulls real content-noise pairs together while pushing fake embeddings apart, accelerating optimization and sharpening decision boundaries. Evaluated on the ASVspoof 2021 and in-the-wild benchmarks, SONAR attains state-of-the-art performance and converges four times faster than strong baselines. By elevating faint high-frequency residuals to first-class learning signals, SONAR unveils a fully data-driven, frequency-guided contrastive framework that splits the latent space into two disjoint manifolds: natural-HF for genuine audio and distorted-HF for synthetic audio, thereby sharpening decision boundaries. Because the scheme operates purely at the representation level, it is architecture-agnostic and, in future work, can be seamlessly integrated into any model or modality where subtle high-frequency cues are decisive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSONAR\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3Deepfake\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u5feb\uff0c\u53ef\u62c6\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e14\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "Deepfake\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSONAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u4e92\u8865\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528XLSR\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u4f4e\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60SRM\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728ASVspoof 2021\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb\u56db\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SONAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6a21\u6001\u3002"}}

Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions.

Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6ConFu\uff0c\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u6613\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u672a\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ConFu\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u878d\u5408\u7ec4\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cConFu\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u548c\u4e8c\u5bf9\u4e00\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "ConFu\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u3002"}}

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment.

We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2).

Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$\u03ba$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($\u03ba_\\mathrm{L}/\u03ba$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $\u03ba$ and $\u03ba_\\mathrm{L}/\u03ba$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$\u03ba$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $\u03ba_\\mathrm{L}/\u03ba$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u752871913\u4e2a\u6761\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8ZT\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4f4e\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd8\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u6676\u683c\u4e0e\u603b\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u6bd4\u7ea6\u4e3a0.5\u5904\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7b5b\u9009\u6750\u6599\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8ZT\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752871913\u4e2a\u6761\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u6676\u683c\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u548c\u6676\u683c\u4e0e\u603b\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u6bd4\u7528\u4e8e\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6750\u6599\u3002", "result": "\u7b5b\u9009104567\u79cd\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a2522\u79cd\u8d85\u4f4e\u70ed\u5bfc\u7387\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core.

Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact.

We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected \"thoughts\" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at \u03b1=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense.

To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity.

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest.

Stochastic block models offer a principled framework for characterizing mesoscale organization, yet their extension to hypergraphs involves a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. A recent simplification, a single-order model, mitigates this complexity by assuming a single affinity pattern governs interactions of all orders. This universal assumption, however, may overlook order-dependent structural details. Here, we propose a framework that relaxes this assumption by introducing a multi-order block structure, in which different affinity patterns govern distinct subsets of interaction orders. Our framework is based on a multi-order stochastic block model and searches for the optimal partition of the set of interaction orders that maximizes out-of-sample hyperlink prediction performance. Analyzing a diverse range of real-world networks, we find that multi-order block structures are prevalent. Accounting for them not only yields better predictive performance over the single-order model but also uncovers sharper, more interpretable mesoscale organization.

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference.

Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy. Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks.

Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed.

Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead.

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6307\u79f0\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7537\u6027\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u56e0\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff08\u82f1 - \u897f/\u6cd5/\u610f\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u6027\u522b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7b80\u5355\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u7537\u6027\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5f3a\u7537\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u9ad8\u6027\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u9760\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u5316\u672f\u8bed\u4e0e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4ece\u9891\u8c31\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u6027\u522b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining.

We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods.

Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data.

A key defense against the misuse of AI-generated audio is by watermarking it, so that it can be easily distinguished from genuine audio. As those seeking to misuse AI-generated audio may thus seek to remove audio watermarks, studying effective watermark removal techniques is critical to being able to objectively evaluate the robustness of audio watermarks against removal. Previous watermark removal schemes either assume impractical knowledge of the watermarks they are designed to remove or are computationally expensive, potentially generating a false sense of confidence in current watermark schemes.\n  We introduce HarmonicAttack, an efficient audio watermark removal method that only requires the basic ability to generate the watermarks from the targeted scheme and nothing else. With this, we are able to train a general watermark removal model that is able to remove the watermarks generated by the targeted scheme from any watermarked audio sample. HarmonicAttack employs a dual-path convolutional autoencoder that operates in both temporal and frequency domains, along with GAN-style training, to separate the watermark from the original audio. When evaluated against state-of-the-art watermark schemes AudioSeal, WavMark, and Silentcipher, HarmonicAttack demonstrates greater watermark removal ability than previous watermark removal methods with near real-time performance. Moreover, while HarmonicAttack requires training, we find that it is able to transfer to out-of-distribution samples with minimal degradation in performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u662f\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHarmonicAttack\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u6c34\u5370\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5370\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6b64\u524d\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HarmonicAttack\uff0c\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GAN\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u79bb\u6c34\u5370\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u97f3\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cHarmonicAttack\u53bb\u9664\u6c34\u5370\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "HarmonicAttack\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5370\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6Matrix\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatrix\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u961f\u5217\u4f20\u9012\u6d88\u606f\u6d88\u9664\u4e2d\u592e\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u72ec\u7acb\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cMatrix\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b02 - 15\u500d\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Matrix\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u4e07\u4e2a\u5e76\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios.

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D \"trace-space\" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTraceGen\u548cTraceForge\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ec5\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5728\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u9891\u5b58\u5728\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u51653D\u201c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\u7edf\u4e00\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u63d0\u51faTraceGen\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1TraceForge\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b123K\u89c6\u9891\u548c1.8M\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\uff0cTraceGen\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5feb50 - 600\u500d\uff1b\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe67.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "TraceGen\u80fd\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains.

Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures.

However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks.

By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faG\u00b2VLM\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3VLMs\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Vision - Language Models (VLMs)\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u5c11\u4ece2D\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faG\u00b2VLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b3D\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4ea4\u9519\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "G\u00b2VLM\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u6216\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "G\u00b2VLM\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u5f3a\u5927\u7684VLM\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea73D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u591a\u59823D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u96be\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u9700\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u96be\u5ea6\u7ec4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u96be\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u96be\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d70\u6377\u5f84\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}
