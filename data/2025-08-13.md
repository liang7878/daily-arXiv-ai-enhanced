### [1] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用拓扑斯理论设计新型分类生成式AI架构，基于Transformer理论成果探索LLM新架构，利用范畴论通用构造构建新结构并理论验证，还给出LLM拓扑斯架构潜在实现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往大语言模型研究集中在链式线性架构或专家混合模型，本文旨在利用拓扑斯理论探索新型LLM架构。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用构造，基于大语言模型范畴的通用性质构建新的组合结构，通过理论证明LLM范畴的（余）完备性及形成拓扑斯。

Result: 理论验证了新的组合结构，证明LLM范畴是（余）完备的且形成拓扑斯，并给出LLM拓扑斯架构的潜在实现方法。

Conclusion: 基于拓扑斯理论设计的新型分类生成式AI架构是可行的，为大语言模型架构设计提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [2] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出拓扑因果模型（TCMs），阐述其利用拓扑范畴性质在因果推理中的应用，证明其范畴完备性，展示因果干预建模、因果等价推理等方面的作用，并介绍用内部逻辑进行推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示拓扑范畴的关键性质在因果推理众多应用中的核心作用，提出新的因果模型。

Method: 利用拓扑范畴（co）完备、存在子对象分类器和指数对象的性质，定义由函数集合构成的TCMs，用（co）极限求解因果图，用自然变换衡量近似质量，用子对象分类器建模因果干预，用指数对象进行因果等价推理，用Mitchell - Benabou语言和Kripke - Joyal语义的内部逻辑推理。

Result: 证明TCMs范畴是（co）完备的，每个因果图有（co）极限形式的“解”；表明因果干预由子对象分类器建模；指数对象可用于因果等价和干预推理；展示用内部逻辑对TCMs中的因果模型进行推理。

Conclusion: 拓扑因果模型利用拓扑范畴性质在因果推理中有重要应用，可进行因果图求解、因果干预建模、因果等价推理等，且有内部逻辑用于推理。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

### [3] [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)
*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，结合多目标算法和目标规划，在问题实例适应度景观相似的场景中快速找到多目标问题的折衷解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用需评估多目标问题解的质量，现代多目标算法求解高度约束的多目标问题困难，且部分问题实例适应度景观有相似特征。

Method: 用计算成本高的多目标算法求解一个问题实例得到近似集，再用目标规划和单目标算法求解其他实例。

Result: 在带时间窗的多目标车辆路径问题基准实例上，该方法能在短时间内产生良好结果。

Conclusion: 该方法可结合多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，在问题实例适应度景观相似的场景中找到好的折衷解。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

### [4] [LLM-BI: Towards Fully Automated Bayesian Inference with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08300)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨用大语言模型（LLM）自动化贝叶斯推理流程的可行性，通过两个实验验证了LLM在贝叶斯建模关键步骤自动化的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯推理广泛应用的障碍在于先验分布和似然函数的指定需要专业统计知识，因此研究用LLM自动化该过程的可行性。

Method: 引入LLM - BI概念管道用于自动化贝叶斯工作流，并进行了两个关于贝叶斯线性回归的实验。

Result: 实验一表明LLM能从自然语言中成功引出先验分布；实验二表明LLM能从单一高级问题描述中指定整个模型结构。

Conclusion: 验证了LLM在贝叶斯建模关键步骤自动化的潜力，为概率编程实现自动化推理管道提供了可能。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [5] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出First Ask Then Answer (FATA)交互范式，引导大语言模型在回答前生成补充问题，实验显示FATA性能和稳定性更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在用户信息不完整或不明确时难以给出准确有用的答案。

Method: 通过提示词引导大语言模型在回答前生成多维补充问题，利用复杂提示技术整合用户补充信息与原查询。采用单轮策略，一次性生成所有澄清问题。

Result: 构建多领域基准进行评估，FATA在综合指标上比B - Prompt高约40%，变异系数比C - Prompt低8%。

Conclusion: FATA能提高大语言模型回答的质量和相关性，且具有更好的稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

### [6] [What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344)
*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出构建基准测试的通用方法和评估协议，评估KG - RAG方法在知识不完整情况下的表现，发现当前方法推理能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG - RAG评估存在问题，如基准测试问题可直接用现有三元组回答、评估指标不一致和答案匹配标准宽松，难以判断模型是推理还是直接检索答案。

Method: 引入构建基准测试的通用方法和评估协议，以系统评估KG - RAG方法在知识不完整情况下的表现。

Result: 当前KG - RAG方法在知识缺失情况下推理能力有限，常依赖内部记忆，泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 当前KG - RAG方法在知识不完整情况下的推理能力需要进一步提升。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

### [7] [UrzaGPT: LoRA-Tuned Large Language Models for Card Selection in Collectible Card Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08382)
*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍UrzaGPT，它基于大语言模型为万智牌提供实时选牌决策，通过微调小模型达到66.2%准确率，证明仅用大语言模型选牌可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集换式卡牌游戏（CCG）因部分可观测性等特点使当前AI模型在CCG任务中表现远不如人类玩家，需开发新的AI模型。

Method: 从开源权重的大语言模型出发，使用低秩自适应微调带注释的选牌日志数据集。

Result: 未微调的小语言模型无法选牌，GPT - 4o零样本性能达43%，UrzaGPT微调小模型用10000步达到66.2%准确率。

Conclusion: 仅使用大语言模型进行选牌是可能的，未来大语言模型可用于开发高效、通用且易于更新的选牌AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [8] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究基于MAB的MCTS在经典规划中的高效实现，提出双层修改和Tree Collapsing改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在决定扩展节点时花费大量时间，经典规划中节点选择运行时间长，需要改进。

Method: 提出对MCTS的双层修改，从选定叶节点进行最佳优先搜索，引入Tree Collapsing减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的均摊O(1)运行时间，与传统基于队列的OPEN列表相当。

Conclusion: 双层修改和Tree Collapsing改进了MCTS在经典规划中的性能，解决了节点选择的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

### [9] [Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08442)
*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种避免全枚举的方法，提升约束建模语言编译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法在处理多数组合无关紧要的问题时效率低，需提升编译效率。

Method: 使用求解器仅计算生成最终约束集所需的组合。

Result: 生成的模型与传统扁平化方法相同，但编译速度显著加快。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了将高级用户模型转换为求解器可用形式的效率，尤其在归纳变量定义域大且有选择性前置条件时。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

### [10] [OverFill: Two-Stage Models for Efficient Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08446)
*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出OverFill方法解耦大语言模型推理的预填充和解码阶段，优化准确率 - 效率权衡，表现优于剪枝模型且减少训练数据使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理成本高，预填充和解码阶段计算特性不同，当前解码器模型统一处理效果不佳。

Method: 提出OverFill，预填充阶段用全模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换到密集剪枝模型顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B - to - 1B配置在标准基准上比1B剪枝模型性能高83.2%，8B - to - 3B配置比3B剪枝模型高79.2%，与从头训练的同规模模型性能相当。

Conclusion: OverFill能有效优化大语言模型推理的准确率 - 效率权衡，减少训练数据使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

### [11] [A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于GRASP的元启发式算法求解触发弧旅行商问题，在实验中取得良好效果并适用于实时路由应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典TSP不能处理动态弧成本问题，本文旨在解决触发弧旅行商问题（TA - TSP），如仓库操作等场景。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索，构造阶段用MIP技术将TA - TSP转化为一系列定制TSP实例，改进阶段应用2 - Opt、Swap和Relocate算子。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例上平均最优差距为0.77%和0.40%；在小合成数据集上比Gurobi求解器结果好11.3%；算法在MESS 2024中进入前三。

Conclusion: 该算法适用于具有状态依赖旅行成本的实时路由应用。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [12] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究指出大语言模型对齐技术依赖的序数比较数据有局限，证明仅靠此无法系统恢复最优选模型，提出需基数反馈，收集相关数据集，实验表明其能让模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有大语言模型对齐技术中基于序数比较的数据收集方法存在更根本的局限性。

Method: 证明仅靠序数比较无法系统恢复最优选模型，收集并公开25000个使用支付意愿引出法得到的基数判断数据集，将基数反馈融入偏好微调。

Result: 将基数反馈融入偏好微调能让模型优先进行高影响改进，在下游基准测试中优于仅用序数的方法。

Conclusion: 选择最优模型需要基于对模型的偏好，而这依赖于关于响应质量的基数反馈。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的POMO模型在解决组合问题如车辆路径规划问题（VRP）上有提升空间。

Result: 新模型收敛更快、效果更好，在CVRPLIB数据集上对最多100个客户的问题实例有改进。

Conclusion: 希望该研究能推动该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

TL;DR: 介绍用于评估大语言模型推理和解决问题能力的视频游戏基准GVGAI - LLM，揭示LLM在空间推理和规划方面的局限，虽干预有部分改善但问题远未解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型的推理和解决问题能力，发现其在特定任务中的局限以推动研究。

Method: 基于General Video Game AI框架构建基准，利用游戏描述语言创建新游戏和关卡，用ASCII字符表示游戏场景，定义可解释指标进行零样本评估。

Result: 揭示了LLM在空间推理和基本规划方面存在持续局限，当前模型有空间和逻辑错误，干预有部分改善。

Conclusion: GVGAI - LLM为推进语言模型能力研究提供可复现的测试平台，尤其关注代理行为和上下文推理。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出SynLLM框架，用20种开源大模型生成高质量合成医疗表格数据，经评估表明规则提示能实现隐私与质量的最佳平衡，推动医疗研究数据共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据获取受限，合成数据是替代方案，但生成有挑战，现有大模型方法缺乏系统提示策略和综合评估框架。

Method: 提出SynLLM框架，使用20种开源大模型，设计四种提示类型，建立综合评估流程。

Result: 在三个公共医疗数据集上评估，提示工程显著影响数据质量和隐私风险，规则提示实现最佳隐私 - 质量平衡。

Conclusion: 在精心设计的提示和多指标评估下，大模型可生成临床合理且注重隐私的合成医疗数据，利于医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏微分方程数值解需平衡精度与效率，传统网格移动技术有计算复杂度高和几何灵活性差问题，现有基于监督学习的方法零样本泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出UGM2N网络，先通过局部几何特征学习实现无监督网格自适应，再开发物理约束损失函数M - Uniform loss来强制节点级网格等分布。

Result: 该网络在高效网格自适应中表现出方程无关泛化性和几何独立性，在不同偏微分方程和网格几何上性能稳健，可扩展到多尺度分辨率，能保证误差降低且无网格纠缠。

Conclusion: UGM2N网络在网格自适应方面优于现有方法，具有良好的泛化性和几何独立性。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在农业应用受限，缺乏领域特定模型、精选数据集和强大评估框架。

Method: 设计多智能体可扩展数据引擎构建Agri - 342K数据集；采用Tri - RAG检索增强生成框架；引入AgriBench - 13K评估基准套件。

Result: AgriGPT在领域适应和推理方面显著优于通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: AgriGPT是模块化、可扩展的农业大语言模型生态系统，为开发专业大语言模型提供可推广框架，将促进农业研究。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常受接地瓶颈阻碍，现有方法多采用临时启发式，需要更正式、通用策略。

Method: 引入diminution概念，给出形式化定义、分析属性和复杂度，用特定编码让求解器评估候选子集，通过域谓词与现有接地器集成。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，该策略所选diminution显著提升性能，平均减少接地时间达70%，减少接地文件大小达85%。

Conclusion: 利用diminution是缓解ASP接地瓶颈的可靠通用方法。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法难以处理EHR数据的稀疏性、异质性，以及临床应用中的患者特定变化和特征成本，需要新方法从复杂的EHR数据中提取有意义的见解。

Method: 提出个性化、在线且考虑成本的特征选择框架，以在线方式为个体患者获取特征，纳入预算约束和特征可变成本。

Result: 该框架可有效管理稀疏和多模态数据，在不同医疗环境中具有稳健和可扩展的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能在预算约束内引导医生逐步获取最有信息价值的特征，提高诊断信心并优化资源利用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: 强调了大语言模型在培训环境中辅助汇报、提供绩效反馈和自动评估的实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Conclusion: 提出的混合机制能够提高基线元启发式算法的性能。

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong
open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through
best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with
group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies
such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both
in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K)
benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency,
while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release
Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small

Result: 在MATH - V和VLM - S2H上比基础模型精度提高9.7%，超Qwen2VL - 72B - Instruct 7.3%；在5个分布外基准测试中优于Phi - 4 - Multimodal - Instruct和LLaMA - 3.2 - 11B - Vision - Instruct；比链式训练在分布内数据集上整体精度高4.3%。

Conclusion: STELAR - Vision框架有效，能提高视觉语言模型推理能力和泛化性，相关数据集已发布，代码待发布。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体实现缺乏统一框架，难以跨不同社会场景泛化和产生一致、逼真行为。

Method: 基于社会认知理论提出框架，包含动机、行动规划和学习三个关键模块。

Result: 理论驱动的智能体在复杂条件下可重现逼真人类行为模式，与经典生成基线相比，多项指标下偏差最多降低75%；消融实验表明移除模块会使误差增加1.5到3.2倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架及模块对生成逼真、连贯的社会行为有显著作用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Motivation: 当前AR代理难以处理复杂多步场景，无法捕捉和利用用户长期时空交互历史。

Method: 提出含感知、记忆、时空推理和执行器四个模块的概念框架，给出实施路线、评估策略、目标应用和用例。

Result: 展示了框架在不同领域的实际适用性。

Conclusion: 该工作可推动开发能有效结合用户交互历史与自适应、上下文感知任务辅助的更智能AR系统。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Motivation: 大语言模型知识易过时不准确，重新训练成本高，知识编辑是高效替代方法。现有综述多关注编辑机制，忽略被编辑知识的功能，因此提出新的分类法以提供更全面视角。

Method: 引入基于功能的分类法，从编辑机制和知识类型两个维度进行综述，分析不同机制对不同知识类型的适用性。

Result: 梳理了当前知识编辑的研究现状，明确了现有方法的优缺点，正式定义了问题，调查了评估任务和数据集。

Conclusion: 指出了知识编辑领域存在的开放性挑战，并给出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱链接预测嵌入方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏标准评估协议和基准资源来定量评估解释。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK软件资源，将基准测试任务流程化，实现主要组件函数化以增强模块化和可扩展性。

Result: 开发出GRainsaCK，可从模型训练到解释评估全流程操作。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱链接预测解释评估的空白，且易于复用。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: 提出E - Agent框架及RemPlan基准，实验显示E - Agent优于现有mRAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有mRAG方法检索策略僵化和视觉信息利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出E - Agent框架，包含mRAG规划器和任务执行器；引入RemPlan基准。

Result: 在RemPlan和三个现有基准测试中，E - Agent比现有mRAG方法准确率提高13%，减少37%的冗余搜索。

Conclusion: E - Agent框架和RemPlan基准有效提升了mRAG系统性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

TL;DR: 研究用RMET和MRMET评估MLLM情绪识别能力，发现MLLM个体表现超人类，但人类集体智慧和人机协作更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI普及，其情绪识别能力对人机交互至关重要，而MLLM情绪智力待探索。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET评估MLLM情绪识别能力，并与人类参与者对比。

Result: MLLM个体平均表现超人类，人类集体智慧超MLLM，人机协作准确性更高。

Conclusion: MLLM个体情绪识别强，但人类集体智慧和人机协作是有效情感AI的最有前途途径。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: 当前单智能体数学推理系统有认知负载干扰问题，提出双智能体混合框架解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单智能体数学推理系统让一个大语言模型集成处理问题推理、代码生成和执行，会造成认知负载干扰。

Method: 通过推理智能体和推理+代码智能体对比验证假设，提出双智能体混合框架，训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 推理+代码智能体虽有工具调用能力，但正确推理路径显著更少。

Conclusion: 双智能体混合框架的解耦角色设计减少认知干扰，促进推理和编码稳定协调。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Motivation: 直接在超大规模模型上进行强化学习实验成本高、资源需求大且风险大，需用更少资源探索强化学习潜力。

Method: 从开源模型出发，通过专门设计的强化学习管道训练，为管道整理30k可验证数学问题数据集，不同阶段配置不同难度分布的数据和训练设置。

Conclusion: Compass - Thinker - 7B模型可在较少计算资源和成本下探索强化学习潜力，为更大模型的强化学习研究提供见解。

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在多模态输入下面临安全挑战，研究其隐式推理安全漏洞。

Method: 开发Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations数据集，并进行简单的上下文学习实验。

Result: 简单的上下文学习能显著缓解隐式多模态威胁。

Conclusion: 迫切需要改进跨模态隐式推理。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究探索前景理论是否适用于大语言模型及认知标记对其决策行为的影响，设计实验并提出框架，发现用前景理论建模大语言模型决策并不总是可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究前景理论是否适用于当代大语言模型，以及表达人类不确定性的认知标记是否会影响其决策行为。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出评估框架，引入认知标记对应概率值来研究其对大语言模型决策行为的影响。

Result: 用前景理论对大语言模型决策进行建模并不总是可靠，尤其是不确定性以多种语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在建模大语言模型决策方面存在局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Conclusion: 通过结构化、内在的方法解决内存限制问题可提升多智能体大语言模型系统在结构化规划任务上的能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章介绍了一个端到端系统，利用机械可解释性技术识别和减轻大语言模型内部的偏差，通过训练探针检测偏差、计算引导向量实时引导模型生成内容，展示了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入社会系统，其延续和放大有害偏差的风险成为关键安全问题，传统方法将模型视为黑盒，需更直接可解释的方法。

Method: 分两个阶段，一是训练线性探针检测模型内部各种偏差的潜在表示；二是计算引导向量，在推理时添加向量引导模型生成过程。

Result: 实验表明探针能近乎完美地识别偏差内容，偏差表示在模型后期层最显著；激活引导技术能将有偏差的完成结果转向更中立的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该工作是一个稳健且可复现的系统，为构建更安全、更负责任的大语言模型提供了更直接和可解释的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦拼车系统中请求前乘客等待时间预测，提出FiXGBoost模型，实验表明该模型预测效果好且可解释性高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注请求后等待时间预测，请求前等待时间预测对乘客规划行程和提升体验很重要，但未被充分研究。

Method: 进行数据驱动研究，分析供需动态对等待时间的影响，基于此进行特征工程，提出FiXGBoost模型，并进行重要性分析。

Result: 在包含超3000万行程记录的大规模真实拼车数据集上实验，FiXGBoost模型在请求前乘客等待时间预测上表现良好。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost模型能有效进行请求前乘客等待时间预测，且具有高可解释性。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVCM作为铁路信号子系统可能发生故障，许多故障源于细微异常，传统方法难以早期检测，因此需要早期识别故障类型以改进维护计划。

Method: 利用深度神经网络构建预测性维护框架，并通过保形预测提供不确定性估计。

Result: 在10个CVCM故障案例中验证，符合ISO - 17359标准，整体准确率达99.31%，能在异常发生1%内检测，保形预测达到99%置信度。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且适用于其他轨道电路和铁路系统，能提高运营可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Motivation: RAG和MRAG中检索与多模态融合使现有成员推理方法无法可靠追溯生成内容来源，影响隐私泄漏问责。

Method: 提出SMA方法，设计基于零阶优化的归因估计机制，引入跨模态归因技术。

Result: SMA可在半黑盒设置下实现生成内容的细粒度来源归因，能对图像检索痕迹进行成员推理。

Conclusion: 将成员推理重点从数据是否被记忆转移到内容来源，为复杂生成系统的数据来源审计提供新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型作为计算机使用代理（CUA）商业潜力增长，最强大的CUA系统细节封闭，研究界需要开源框架来研究其能力、局限和风险。

Method: 提出OpenCUA框架，包含无缝捕获人类计算机使用演示的注释基础设施、跨3个操作系统和200多个应用及网站的AgentNet数据集、将演示转换为状态 - 动作对并带有反思性长思维链推理的可扩展管道。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的智能体在信息搜索中难以平衡搜索范围和推理深度，串行查询限制信息覆盖，原始输入干扰多步推理连续性。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，由编程增强的规划器 - 执行器智能体对组成，规划器制定和调整搜索策略，执行器进行高效有针对性的检索。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster始终优于开源和专有基线模型，在BrowseComp - en得分为30.0，在BrowseComp - zh得分为46.5。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在大规模复杂、推理要求高的信息搜索任务中具有强大能力。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Motivation: 应对工程行业对复合材料不断增长的需求，提高代表性体积单元建模的代表性，减少网格和尺寸敏感性。

Method: 提出缓减RVE建模中网格敏感性的技术；基于确保应变周期性的假设，制定一组改进的周期性边界条件（MPBCs）；分析1200个不同纤维体积分数和RVE尺寸组合的样本。

Result: 验证了MPBCs在横向加载下能减弱RVE尺寸对材料响应精度的影响，特别是在非弹性区域；发现特定纤维排列使区域更易损伤。

Conclusion: 改进的方法有助于提高复合材料多尺度建模的效果，对理解复合材料微观失效和损伤起始有重要意义。

Abstract: Acknowledging the ever-increasing demand for composites in the engineering
industry, this paper focuses on the failure of composites at the microscale and
augmenting the use of multiscale modelling techniques to make them better for
various applications. This work aims to increase the representativeness of the
volume element by attenuating the mesh and size sensitivities in representative
volume element (RVE) modelling. A technique to alleviate mesh sensitivity in
RVE modelling is proposed, which equalises the fracture energy observed from
computational analysis with the real phenomenon, thereby keeping the response
independent of the bandwidth of strain localisation. Based on the hypothesis
that ensuring periodicity of strain, in addition to displacement periodicity
across the domain boundary and supplementing the capability of periodic
boundary conditions (PBCs) to attenuate the size dependency in RVE modelling, a
set of modified PBCs (MPBCs) are formulated. One thousand two hundred RVE
samples falling into combinations of five fibre volume fractions and four RVE
sizes are analysed under transverse loading, and the ability of MPBCs to
attenuate the effect of RVE size on the precision of material response,
particularly in the inelastic regime, is verified. This work also focuses on
various factors affecting damage initiation in 2D composite RVEs. The
arrangement of a pair of fibres with their members placed close to each other,
such that the angle between the direction of loading and an imaginary line
drawn between their centres is less, is observed to make the region between
them more favourable to damage.

this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

Motivation: 现代AI系统日益复杂，摩尔定律终结，需考虑硬件发展以提升系统效率。

Method: 采用跨栈方法，在算法、系统和硬件层面提出解决方案，如PipeRAG等针对RAG，FANNS等针对向量搜索，MicroRec和FleetRec针对推荐系统。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

Result: 在7个真实数据集上实验，Tagore实现1.32x - 112.79x的加速，同时保持索引质量。

Conclusion: Tagore能有效解决基于图的索引开销大的问题，在加速索引构建的同时保持索引质量。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

Motivation: 现有基于规则的SQL查询重写方法在处理新查询模式和复杂查询时存在局限，无法完全捕捉有效重写策略。

Method: 提出E3 - Rewrite框架，包含上下文构建模块和强化学习框架，通过构建提示、设计奖励函数和采用分阶段课程学习。

Result: 在多个SQL基准测试中，E3 - Rewrite比现有方法最多降低25.6%的查询执行时间，多实现24.4%的成功重写。

Conclusion: E3 - Rewrite能有效提高SQL查询重写的效率和覆盖率，处理复杂查询。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

Result: 特定优化下GPU利用率可达100%，但SM和张量核心等低级别资源利用率仅15% - 30%，CPU端事件常成瓶颈。

Conclusion: 为NVIDIA边缘设备视觉推理工作负载用户提供了关键观察建议。

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices and advancements in network technologies
have intensified the demand for real-time data processing at the network edge.
To address these demands, low-power AI accelerators, particularly GPUs, are
increasingly deployed for inference tasks, enabling efficient computation while
mitigating cloud-based systems' latency and bandwidth limitations. Despite
their growing deployment, GPUs remain underutilised even in computationally
intensive workloads. This underutilisation stems from the limited understanding
of GPU resource sharing, particularly in edge computing scenarios. In this
work, we conduct a detailed analysis of both high- and low-level metrics,
including GPU utilisation, memory usage, streaming multiprocessor (SM)
utilisation, and tensor core usage, to identify bottlenecks and guide
hardware-aware optimisations. By integrating traces from multiple profiling
tools, we provide a comprehensive view of resource behaviour on NVIDIA Jetson
edge devices under concurrent vision inference workloads. Our findings indicate
that while GPU utilisation can reach $100\%$ under specific optimisations,
critical low-level resources, such as SMs and tensor cores, often operate only
at $15\%$ to $30\%$ utilisation. Moreover, we observe that certain CPU-side
events, such as thread scheduling, context switching, etc., frequently emerge
as bottlenecks, further constraining overall GPU performance. We provide
several key observations for users of vision inference workloads on NVIDIA edge
devices.

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建可扩展、保护隐私和边缘感知的下一代无线网络吞吐量预测系统提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: 所提调度框架在策略设计、动态资源建模和多租户服务保障方面有实用和工程价值，有效提高复杂条件下分布式系统调度效率和资源管理能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant
distributed systems, including dynamic resource variation, heterogeneous tenant
demands, and fairness assurance. An adaptive scheduling method based on
reinforcement learning is proposed. By modeling the scheduling process as a
Markov decision process, the study defines the state space, action space, and
reward function. A scheduling policy learning framework is designed using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the core algorithm. This enables dynamic
perception of complex system states and real-time decision-making. Under a
multi-objective reward mechanism, the scheduler jointly optimizes task latency,
resource utilization, and tenant fairness. The coordination between the policy
network and the value network continuously refines the scheduling strategy.
This enhances overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, a series of experiments were conducted in multi-scenario
environments built using a real-world public dataset. The experiments evaluated
task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing scheduling
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong stability
and generalization ability. The proposed scheduling framework provides
practical and engineering value in policy design, dynamic resource modeling,
and multi-tenant service assurance. It effectively improves scheduling
efficiency and resource management in distributed systems under complex
conditions.

Conclusion: P/D - Device方案优于其他替代方案，能有效解决资源瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

Abstract: The setting for the online transportation problem is a metric space $M$,
populated by $m$ parking garages of varying capacities. Over time cars arrive
in $M$, and must be irrevocably assigned to a parking garage upon arrival in a
way that respects the garage capacities. The objective is to minimize the

conjectured that there is a $(2m-1)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for
the online transportation problem, matching the optimal competitive ratio for
the simpler online metric matching problem. Recently, Harada and Itoh presented
the first $O(m)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the online
transportation problem. Our contribution is an alternative algorithm design and
analysis that we believe is simpler.

Abstract: We design a deterministic compiler that makes any computation in the
Congested Clique model robust to a constant fraction $\alpha<1$ of adversarial
crash faults. In particular, we show how a network of $n$ nodes can compute any
circuit of depth $d$, width $\omega$, and gate total fan $\Delta$, in
$d\cdot\lceil\frac{\omega}{n^2}+\frac{\Delta}{n}\rceil\cdot
2^{O(\sqrt{\log{n}}\log\log{n})}$ rounds in such a faulty model. As a
corollary, any $T$-round Congested Clique algorithm can be compiled into an
algorithm that completes in $T^2 n^{o(1)}$ rounds in this model.
  Our compiler obtains resilience to node crashes by coding information across
the network, where we leverage locally-decodable codes (LDCs) to maintain a low
complexity overhead, as these allow recovering the information needed at each
computational step by querying only small parts of the codeword.
  The main technical contribution is that because erasures occur in known
locations, which correspond to crashed nodes, we can derandomize classical LDC
constructions by deterministically selecting query sets that avoid sufficiently
many erasures. Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our
derandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing
congestion and maintaining a low round complexity.
  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can
target precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain
codeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a
decoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its
decoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node
itself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By
carefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges
posed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of
crashes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling $n$ jobs on $m$ uniform machines while
minimizing the makespan ($Q||C_{\max}$) and maximizing the minimum completion
time ($Q||C_{\min}$) in an online setting with migration of jobs. In this
online setting, the jobs are inserted or deleted over time, and at each step,
the goal is to compute a near-optimal solution while reassigning some jobs,
such that the overall processing time of reassigned jobs, called migration, is
bounded by some factor $\beta$ times the processing time of the job added or
removed.
  We propose Efficient Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (EPTASs) with an
additional load error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon p_{\max})$ for both problems,
with constant amortized migration factor $\beta$, where $p_{\max}$ is the
maximum processing time in the instance over all steps. As an intermediate
step, we obtain Efficient Parameterized Approximation Schemes (EPASs) for both
problems, $(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithms parameterized by $p_{\max}$
and the number of different processing times $d$ in an instance, with $\beta$
bounded in a function of $p_{\max}$, $d$ and $\varepsilon$.
  This is the first result in the direction of a polynomial time approximation
scheme in the field of online scheduling with bounded reassignment on uniform
machines; before, such results were known only for the considered problems on
identical machines. Crucial to our result is a division of the machines into
large and small machines depending on the current approximate objective value,
allowing for different approaches on either machine set, as well as a new way
of rounding the instance that does not depend on the current objective value.

equilibrium. Furthermore a class of RQE has recently been shown in
arXiv:2406.14156 to be universally computationally tractable in all
finite-horizon Markov games, allowing for the development of multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper,
we expand upon the study of RQE and analyze their computation in both
two-player normal form games and discounted infinite-horizon Markov games. For
normal form games we adopt a monotonicity-based approach allowing us to
generalize previous results. We first show uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity
of RQE with respect to player's payoff matrices under monotonicity assumptions,
and then provide conditions on the players' degrees of risk aversion and
bounded rationality that ensure monotonicity. We then focus on discounted
infinite-horizon Markov games. We define the risk-averse quantal-response
Bellman operator and prove its contraction under further conditions on the
players' risk-aversion, bounded rationality, and temporal discounting. This
yields a Q-learning based algorithm with convergence guarantees for all
infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games.

Result: 存在多项式时间算法找到解决方案；有数量限制时问题计算困难；能在多项式时间确定解是否存在。

Conclusion: 研究的方法可有效判断嫉妒问题是否有解，有理论价值且并非易事。

Abstract: We consider the problem of resolving the envy of a given initial allocation
by adding elements from a pool of goods. We give a characterization of the
instances where envy can be resolved by adding an arbitrary number of copies of
the items in the pool. From this characterization, we derive a polynomial-time
algorithm returning a respective solution if it exists. If the number of copies
or the total number of added items are bounded, the problem becomes
computationally intractable even in various restricted cases. We perform a
parameterized complexity analysis, focusing on the number of agents and the
pool size as parameters. Notably, although not every instance admits an
envy-free solution, our approach allows us to efficiently determine, in
polynomial time, whether a solution exists-an aspect that is both theoretically
interesting and far from trivial.

Abstract: Online bidding is crucial in mobile ecosystems, enabling real-time ad
allocation across billions of devices to optimize performance and user
experience. Improving ad allocation efficiency is a long-standing research
problem, as it directly enhances the economic outcomes for all participants in
advertising platforms. This paper investigates the design of optimal boost
factors in online bidding while incorporating quality value (the impact of
displayed ads on publishers' long-term benefits). To address the divergent
interests on quality, we establish a three-party auction framework with a
unified welfare metric of advertiser and publisher. Within this framework, we
derive the theoretical efficiency lower bound for C-competitive boost in
second-price single-slot auctions, then design a novel quality-involved
Boosting (q-Boost) algorithm for computing the optimal boost factor.
Experimental validation on Alibaba's public dataset (AuctionNet) demonstrates
2%-6% welfare improvements over conventional approaches, proving our method's
effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索引擎仅用产品标题排序效果不佳，产品描述因冗长不适合实时排序，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出ReLSum强化学习框架，利用相关性得分作为奖励，用可训练大语言模型生成摘要，输入交叉编码器排序模型。

Result: 实验在离线指标（召回率、NDCG）和在线用户参与度指标上有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLSum为大规模电商系统提升搜索相关性提供可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

TL;DR: 提出LLM - TUP方法进行用户画像建模，在真实数据集实验中优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于内容推荐系统的用户画像方法简单，无法捕捉用户偏好动态，特别是长短偏好的交互。

Method: 提出LLM - TUP方法，利用交互时间戳和大语言模型生成用户历史的自然语言表示，用预训练BERT模型编码，再用注意力机制融合长短偏好嵌入。

Result: 在真实数据集实验中，LLM - TUP比多个基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 时间感知的用户画像方法及使用大语言模型生成的语义丰富的用户画像对个性化内容推荐有效。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

Method: 系统研究大语言模型在拆分长短偏好以捕捉用户上下文动态方面的有效性，将时间偏好作为推荐的动态上下文，融合不同上下文组件生成综合用户嵌入。

Result: 大语言模型生成的画像有语义深度和时间结构，但在上下文感知推荐中的效果依赖用户交互历史丰富度，在密集领域效果好，稀疏领域改善不明显。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在增强用户画像以实现自适应、上下文感知推荐方面有细微潜力，数据集特征对实际应用至关重要。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

Motivation: 现有研究采用‘一刀切’个性化策略，未区分各轮查询的具体个性化需求，可能导致结果不佳。

Method: 先识别查询所需的个性化水平，将个性化查询与其他查询改写整合生成增强查询；设计个性化感知的排序融合方法，根据所需个性化水平动态分配融合权重。

Result: 在两个TREC iKAT数据集上评估，APCIR框架优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APCIR框架的自适应个性化方法有效。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能提供语义网在标准语言支持、本体使用和质量评估方面的状态快照。

Abstract: Over the last decade, knowledge graphs have multiplied, grown, and evolved on
the World Wide Web, and the advent of new standards, vocabularies, and
application domains has accelerated this trend. IndeGx is a framework
leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the
capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge
representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a
reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with
respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a
fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL
rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and
reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection
of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a
declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative
environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive
KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in
the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is
out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our
community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In
particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web
regarding supported standard languages, ontology usage, and diverse quality
evaluations by applying this method to a collection of over 300 open knowledge
graph endpoints.

Result: 离线和在线实验表明CCN显著提升路线推荐性能，有强可解释性。

Conclusion: CCN能有效用于路线推荐，在高德地图部署后提供稳定和最优效益。

Abstract: Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,
with the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to
users. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local
quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for
enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.
To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison
Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and
item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in
traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features
which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture
the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block
(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a
Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can
update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive
comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of
candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since
routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model
must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an
interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline
and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR
performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed
in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for
route recommendations.

Result: 在47人对照研究中，基于画像的评估与人类判断高度匹配，表现优于或等同于使用原始收听历史的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架可实现高效、基于画像的评估，用于推荐系统迭代测试和模型选择。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法易受偏差影响，生成的解释可能与用户实际偏好不符。

Method: 提出利用大语言模型进行预处理，过滤非用户特征历史项，在两个公共数据集上针对流行度偏差，将该方法应用于ACCENT框架。

Result: 该方法创建的反事实比单独的ACCENT框架更符合每个用户的流行度偏好。

Conclusion: 提出的预处理步骤能有效解决反事实解释方法的偏差问题，使解释更符合用户偏好。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) offer a tangible and actionable way to
explain recommendations by showing users a "what-if" scenario that demonstrates
how small changes in their history would alter the system's output. However,
existing CFE methods are susceptible to bias, generating explanations that
might misalign with the user's actual preferences. In this paper, we propose a
pre-processing step that leverages large language models to filter
out-of-character history items before generating an explanation. In experiments
on two public datasets, we focus on popularity bias and apply our approach to
ACCENT, a neural CFE framework. We find that it creates counterfactuals that
are more closely aligned with each user's popularity preferences than ACCENT
alone.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效且有实用价值。

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

Motivation: 弗吉尼亚17、18世纪土地专利以叙述性描述为主，限制空间分析，评估大语言模型转换其为地理坐标的能力。

Method: 使用5471份弗吉尼亚专利摘要，以43个验证案例为基准，测试6个OpenAI模型在两种范式下的表现，并与多个基线比较。

Result: o3 - 2025 - 04 - 16单调用模型误差低，五调用集成进一步降低误差，专利人姓名编辑消融使误差增加，gpt - 4o - 2024 - 08 - 06成本效益高，外部地理编码工具无明显优势。

Conclusion: LLMs在可扩展、准确和经济高效的历史地理参考方面有潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

Result: 在二分类和多分类任务中，比现有方法有更好的准确率和稀疏度，且无需梯度信息。

Conclusion: 在分类任务中方法有效，且复杂网络架构和学习任务需合适评估指标。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Hat - DFed框架解决去中心化联邦学习在边缘计算系统中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化联邦学习（DFL）在边缘计算系统中因拓扑动态变化、资源和数据异构性带来成本高、模型性能下降等问题，需设计有效DFL框架。

Method: 将拓扑构建表述为双优化问题，设计两阶段算法动态构建最优通信拓扑并估计影响，加入重要性感知模型聚合机制。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论，但提出的Hat - DFed框架有望解决DFL在边缘计算系统中的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期时间序列预测对环境监测至关重要，但水质预测因复杂周期性、非平稳性和生态因素导致的突变波动而具有挑战性，多站点场景需同时建模时空动态，进一步加剧了难度。

Method: 引入XFMNet，通过自适应下采样对齐水质序列和遥感输入的时间分辨率，进行局部自适应分解分离趋势和周期分量，利用交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空模式与生态线索，通过渐进和递归融合捕捉长期趋势和短期波动。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，XFMNet相比现有基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: XFMNet对空间分布时间序列预测有效。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Conclusion: MoSSDA框架在多变量时间序列分类的半监督域适应问题上表现出色，各模块对性能提升有效，代码开源。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Conclusion: MGSTC方法能在实际连续预测场景中实现高精度预测，有效解决现有研究问题。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能不仅源于架构新颖，还在于实现了生物进化优化的计算原理。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Conclusion: 该策略能结合高光谱场景上下文信息，捕捉潜在材料光谱变化，为候选材料提供可解释概率度量。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Motivation: SDPA机制的数学形式常基于启发式方法，本文旨在从第一性原理为其提供理论依据。

Method: 先证明注意力前向传播是退化的单边熵最优传输（EOT）问题的精确解，再证明标准的反向传播梯度与基于优势的策略梯度在数学上相同，并揭示EOT前向传播公式在注意力分布空间上诱导的信息几何。

Result: 发现前向传播进行最优推理，反向传播实现基于流形感知的学习更新。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种有原则的机制，前向传播执行最优推理，反向传播实现合理的、基于流形感知的学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法能有效解决计算异构问题。

Conclusion: 相比现有方法，该方法显著提升了公平性和整体性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Conclusion: 全谱统计方法在谱特征已知或建模良好时最有效，端到端机器学习在测量条件不确定时是不错选择。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据集实验中，DCCD - CONF在因果图恢复和混淆变量识别上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCCD - CONF框架性能良好，且有一致性保证，理论可靠。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架忽视边缘客户端计算异质性和资源受限设备训练负担，且存在高通信成本和复杂模型聚合问题，结合分割学习和分层联邦学习又引入训练复杂性。

Method: 提出SHeRL - FL，允许客户端和边缘服务器独立于云端计算训练目标。在多种数据集、模型及不同设置下进行图像分类和分割任务实验。

Result: SHeRL - FL相比集中式FL和HierFL减少超90%数据传输，比SplitFed减少50%，并改进分层分割学习方法。

Conclusion: SHeRL - FL在减少通信开销和协调复杂度上有效，能提升性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出模糊模式Tsetlin机(FPTM)，其子句评估模糊，减少子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高准确率，在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Tsetlin机的“全有或全无”子句评估策略需大量子句才能达到有竞争力的准确率，为解决此问题提出FPTM。

Method: 引入模糊子句评估机制，若子句中部分文字不匹配，其余文字仍可按比例贡献分数。

Result: 在IMDb、Fashion - MNIST、亚马逊销售数据集上有良好表现，如在IMDb数据集仅用每类一个子句达90.15%准确率，训练速度提升，内存占用小等。

Conclusion: FPTM更灵活、高效、鲁棒，能显著减少子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高准确率。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

Result: 离线实验验证有效性，在线A/B测试中转化率提升11.29%，收入提升12.35%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升自动出价效果。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Result: 实证发现，即使是具有单个宽隐藏层的贝叶斯神经网络，配备灵活可训练激活函数后，也能有效实现所需的函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 可训练激活函数能帮助贝叶斯神经网络实现函数空间先验。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Conclusion: FWPs体现了自然智能和人工智能的融合趋势。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 注意力机制是Transformer架构核心，虽注意力权重不直接决定模型输出，但能反映标记影响模式，可补充现有可解释性技术，因此研究其在可解释AI框架中的潜力。

Method: 开发两种新解释方法，一是将注意力权重集成到Shapley值分解中，二是将注意力权重纳入通过概念激活向量定义的标记级方向导数中。

Result: 在标准基准上的实证评估和与广泛使用的解释方法的比较研究表明，注意力权重可以有意义地融入所研究的可解释AI框架。

Conclusion: 注意力权重在丰富Transformer可解释性方面有价值。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Result: 所提方法能比当前标准做法用更少数据更有效地评估大语言模型性能。

Conclusion: 主动测试可成功扩展到大型语言模型评估，且表现优于现有标准做法。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Result: 在多数据集上评估，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释现实且符合模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer能有效解决现有异构图解释方法的不足。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的QPOT公式能有效诱导稀疏性，便于POT在有稀疏性要求的应用中使用。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Conclusion: 该基本并行化策略可扩展到包括云平台和多节点高性能计算集群等多种异构环境。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network

improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Motivation: OCIL面临在严格内存约束下保持模型稳定性和适应新任务的挑战，现有基于重放的方法和集成方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出通过GWM增强集成学习，GWM融合学生模型参数，作为动态锚点；引入多级协作蒸馏机制，确保学生间一致性和知识保留。

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法在不同内存预算下显著提升了多个OCIL模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能让学生模型适应新任务并保留旧知识，在稳定性和适应性间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Result: COGS在TSP训练分布空间有更好数据覆盖和插值，在多个数据集评估显示其提升了分布鲁棒性，多数性能提升来自最坏情况。

Conclusion: COGS方法能有效解决TSP问题的分布鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Conclusion: SARM是有效的奖励模型，能解决传统模型的局限，提升大语言模型与人类价值观的对齐效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiFac框架在半监督学习中是有效的，能提升图神经网络性能。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Conclusion: TempOpt实用且克服了现有时间依赖方法的局限，能有效学习警报关系以识别根警报。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Result: 在八个真实时间序列数据集上，WaveTS系列模型达SOTA性能，参数显著减少，WaveTS - M在多通道数据集表现佳。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型有效，能解决传统模型局限。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

Result: Oblivionis优于本地训练，能在遗忘效果和模型效用间取得平衡。

Conclusion: Oblivionis框架增强了联邦大语言模型的可信度和合规性，为未来大语言模型发展提供方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Motivation: 类别增量持续学习中模型对抗攻击的脆弱性研究不足，探索其在阶段转移攻击下的情况。

Result: 持续学习方法易受阶段转移攻击，现有基于对抗训练的防御方法效果不足。

Conclusion: 类别增量持续学习模型在阶段转移攻击下存在严重安全问题，现有防御手段需改进。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Method: 提出LNN - PINN框架，在隐藏层映射中引入轻量级门控机制，保持采样策略、损失组成和超参数设置不变。

Result: 在四个基准问题上，LNN - PINN在相同训练条件下持续降低RMSE和MAE，绝对误差图也证实其精度提升，且在不同维度、边界条件和算子特性下有强适应性和稳定性。

Conclusion: LNN - PINN为提高物理信息神经网络在复杂科学和工程问题中的预测精度提供了简洁有效的架构改进方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，GenCast持续降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast模型能有效解决无传感器区域交通预测问题，提高了预测的准确性和模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GRAVITY框架能有效提升顶点分类效果，其基于场驱动的组织方式可强化类边界并促进潜在簇内的语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 利用频域信息进行时间序列对抗攻击的方法可行且有效。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在分层推理学习中有效，能降低延迟、提高准确性并减少带宽使用，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper

Result: 无算法在所有输入网络最优，多数算法在社交网络表现好，模型堆叠随机森林可扩展性高，在AUC或Top - k精度上有优势。

Conclusion: 算法性能强烈依赖网络特征，元学习算法能为单个网络选择最佳算法，优于现有算法且可扩展到大型网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Result: 用Chi - Geometry生成数据集对SOTA GNN架构进行基准测试，设计出两种新的GNN架构，一种有高计算成本但预测准确，另一种保证计算成本线性增长且检测手性有竞争力。

Conclusion: Chi - Geometry库可有效用于GNN手性预测的基准测试，两种新GNN架构各有优势。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，还对方法设计选择给出了对未来研究有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

Result: 在不同基准测试中取得良好结果，自然支持开放世界环境下成本感知的主动特征获取。

Conclusion: ASPIRE向真正通用、语义感知的结构化数据推理迈进了一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

Conclusion: MaC - Cal为DNN中可靠的置信度估计提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

Motivation: 游戏领域状态空间大，进化方法搜索空间随可训练参数增加而指数级增大，影响收敛速度，需减少输入空间大小。

Method: 引入Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE)，利用离散余弦变换将输入状态转换为系数矩阵，对矩阵截断和稀疏化以降低输入空间维度。

Result: 在Atari游戏Space Invaders中，SCOPE结合CMA - ES优于OpenAI - ES、HyperNEAT等进化方法和DQN、A3C等简单强化学习方法，将输入大小从33,600减少53%至15,625。

Conclusion: SCOPE能有效减少输入空间大小，同时保持对原空间有意义的表示，在游戏领域有良好表现。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务大量大语言模型（LLM）适配器会带来开销、性能下降和最优放置挑战，需解决这些问题。

Method: 构建AI驱动分析管道，基于当前工作负载模式确定适配器最优分配；开发能复制在线LLM适配器服务系统的数字孪生。

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

### [133] [Profiling Large Language Model Inference on Apple Silicon: A Quantization Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08531)
*Afsara Benazir,Felix Xiaozhu Lin*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 本文研究Apple Silicon统一内存架构对设备端大语言模型推理的影响，通过基准测试对比其与NVIDIA GPU的性能，分析性能瓶颈并得出结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前硬件效率领域缺乏对Apple Silicon的系统理解，研究多集中于CUDA设备的GPU加速，本文旨在研究Apple Silicon在设备端大语言模型推理中的表现。

Method: 通过直接进行延迟和吞吐量对比基准测试，剖析性能差异，分析底层硬件指标，在5个硬件测试平台上进行大规模评估。

Result: 发现Apple Silicon的大统一内存使其在超大型语言模型上比NVIDIA GPU更具成本效益和效率，分析揭示了多种资源相互依赖关系和意外发现。

Conclusion: 本研究首次对Apple Silicon在设备端推理进行了全面表征和分析。

Abstract: A systematic understanding of Apple Silicon is lacking in the current
landscape of hardware efficiency; research focus is largely centered on
accelerating GPUs for large-scale training or inference on CUDA devices. This
paper investigates Apple Silicon's unique memory architecture that offers a
unified memory integrating CPU and GPU memory and its implications for
on-device LLM inference.
  We decipher myths about whether Apple Silicon is efficient for on-device
inference compared to competitors such as NVIDIA GPUs by directly conducting
latency and throughput comparison benchmarks. We explain the performance gap
between them through profiling low level hardware metrics - ALU utilization,
memory bandwidth, buffer usage, cache residency etc. at runtime. We draw
several insights regarding performance bottlenecks such as dequantization
overhead, compute throughput and memory bandwidth. We debunk existing false
claims regarding large language model inference such as compressing models to
lower bit precision is a defacto promise for faster inference across all
hardware platforms. We find that the large unified memory enables Apple Silicon
to be both cost effective and efficient against NVIDIA GPUs for ultra large
language models.
  Our large scale evaluation on 5 hardware testbeds incorporating three Apple
M-series devices: M2 Ultra, M2 Max and M4 Pro and two NVIDIA GPUs: NVIDIA RTX
A6000, a multi GPU setup with 2xNVIDIA RTX A6000, 5 model scales ranging from
8B to 405B parameters and 14 quantization schemes gives an understanding of how
Apple Silicon fits within the paradigm of on-device LLM inference. Our analysis
reveals multiple resource interdependencies and unexpected findings, while also
quantifying established insights. To the best of our knowledge, this study
makes the first attempt to present a thorough characterization and analysis of
Apple Silicon for on-device inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂多文件项目的代码生成和软件工程任务中因上下文限制和知识缺口面临困难。

Method: 结合Intent Translator、Elicit语义文献检索、NotebookLM文档合成和Claude Code多智能体系统的上下文工程工作流，利用意图澄清、检索增强生成和专门子智能体。

Result: 显著提高代码助手在真实仓库中的准确性和可靠性，在Next.js代码库有良好表现，与其他框架对比展现出优势。

Conclusion: 讨论了基于大语言模型的代码助手在生产中部署的影响、上下文管理经验和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation
and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex,
multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究对比开源小语言模型（SLMs）与大语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成上的性能和能源效率，发现LLMs正确性高，但SLMs输出正确时更节能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业大语言模型代码生成时能耗高、碳排放大，研究SLMs能否在特定编程问题上匹配LLMs性能且更节能。

Method: 评估LeetCode 150个不同难度编码问题，对比三个开源SLMs和两个商业LLMs，用四项指标评估代码，以人类编写代码为基线。

Result: LLMs在各难度级别正确性最高，但SLMs输出正确时更节能，超52%问题中SLMs能耗与LLMs相同或更低。

Conclusion: SLMs在输出正确代码时能源效率表现更好，有一定应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated
problems, SLMs consumed the same or less energy than LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用历史构建数据、PR元数据和上下文信息对合并管道中PR顺序进行优化，实验表明该方法优于传统策略且不依赖特定构建系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型单体软件仓库集成变更时，合并管道负载高成瓶颈，现有优化依赖特定构建系统，通用性和适用性受限。

Method: 仅利用历史构建数据、PR元数据和上下文信息进行实用构建预测，动态优先处理高峰时段可能通过的PR。

Result: 在真实大型项目实验中，预测排序显著优于传统先入先出和非基于学习的排序策略。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖底层构建系统，易于集成到现有自动合并管道。

Abstract: Integrating changes into large monolithic software repositories is a critical
step in modern software development that substantially impacts the speed of
feature delivery, the stability of the codebase, and the overall productivity
of development teams. To ensure the stability of the main branch, many
organizations use merge pipelines that test software versions before the
changes are permanently integrated. However, the load on merge pipelines is
often so high that they become bottlenecks, despite the use of parallelization.
Existing optimizations frequently rely on specific build systems, limiting
their generalizability and applicability. In this paper we propose to optimize
the order of PRs in merge pipelines using practical build predictions utilizing
only historical build data, PR metadata, and contextual information to estimate
the likelihood of successful builds in the merge pipeline. By dynamically
prioritizing likely passing PRs during peak hours, this approach maximizes
throughput when it matters most. Experiments conducted on a real-world,
large-scale project demonstrate that predictive ordering significantly
outperforms traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO), as well as
non-learning-based ordering strategies. Unlike alternative optimizations, this
approach is agnostic to the underlying build system and thus easily integrable
into existing automated merge pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出OmniLLP框架改进LLM - 基于的日志级别预测器（LLP），结合代码语义和开发者所有权信号，提升预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的日志级别预测器依赖随机选择上下文示例，忽略现代软件项目结构和多样化日志实践，需提升预测准确性。

Method: 提出OmniLLP框架，基于代码语义相似性和开发者所有权内聚性对源文件聚类，从聚类中选取上下文学习示例。

Result: 语义和所有权感知聚类显著提高LLM - 基于的LLP预测准确率（最高提升8% AUC），结合两者信号的方法在评估项目中AUC达0.88 - 0.96。

Conclusion: 将代码语义和开发者所有权信号等软件工程特定上下文集成到LLM - LLPs中具有价值，能增强系统可维护性和可观测性。

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

Motivation: 语言模型在软件工程任务中存在幻觉问题，代码变更任务中的幻觉现象研究不足，需进行分析。

Method: 对提交消息生成和代码审查评论生成两个任务进行研究，量化幻觉比例，探索基于多指标的自动检测方法。

Result: 约50%的生成代码审查和20%的生成提交消息包含幻觉，多指标结合可提升检测性能，模型置信度和特征归因指标有助于检测。

Conclusion: 模型置信度和特征归因指标在推理时检测幻觉有前景。

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍新数据集QuRE，含2111条工业需求，做了描述性统计并对比其他数据集，旨在推动需求质量数据集金标准发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言需求质量缺陷的实证研究依赖的数据集存在难获取、规模小、细节不足等问题。

Method: 引入QuRE数据集，对其进行描述性统计，与现有需求数据集和合成需求进行比较。

Result: QuRE与合成数据集语言相似，但有详细上下文描述，标签在工业环境中系统广泛使用近十年。

Conclusion: 发布QuRE数据集有助于为需求质量数据集建立通用金标准，促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Requirements quality is central to successful software and systems
engineering. Empirical research on quality defects in natural language
requirements relies heavily on datasets, ideally as realistic and
representative as possible. However, such datasets are often inaccessible,
small, or lack sufficient detail. This paper introduces QuRE (Quality in
Requirements), a new dataset comprising 2,111 industrial requirements that have
been annotated through a real-world review process. Previously used for over
five years as part of an industrial contract, this dataset is now being
released to the research community. In this work, we furthermore provide
descriptive statistics on the dataset, including measures such as lexical
diversity and readability, and compare it to existing requirements datasets and
synthetically generated requirements. In contrast to synthetic datasets, QuRE
is linguistically similar to existing ones. However, this dataset comes with a
detailed context description, and its labels have been created and used
systematically and extensively in an industrial context over a period of close
to a decade. Our goal is to foster transparency, comparability, and empirical
rigor by supporting the development of a common gold standard for requirements
quality datasets. This, in turn, will enable more sound and collaborative
research efforts in the field.

Method: 对Defects4J和BugsInPy数据集中的16个开源Java和Python项目中故障的时空特征进行实证分析。

Result: 软件系统中很多故障长期存在，多数软件版本有多个共存故障；故障虽只在系统的小部分子集中出现，但分布较均匀，热点较少。

Conclusion: 实际软件故障情况与原数据集假设不同，故障有长期存在和分布均匀的特点。

Abstract: Fixing software faults contributes significantly to the cost of software
maintenance and evolution. Techniques for reducing these costs require datasets
of software faults, as well as an understanding of the faults, for optimal
testing and evaluation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the
temporal and spatial characteristics of faults existing in 16 open-source Java
and Python projects, which form part of the Defects4J and BugsInPy datasets,
respectively. Our findings show that many faults in these software systems are
long-lived, leading to the majority of software versions having multiple
coexisting faults. This is in contrast to the assumptions of the original
datasets, where the majority of versions only identify a single fault. In
addition, we show that although the faults are found in only a small subset of
the systems, these faults are often evenly distributed amongst this subset,
leading to relatively few bug hotspots.

Motivation: 软件定义汽车（SDV）推动向基于虚拟化架构转变，但一级集成商难以将静态配置适应不同系统需求和工作负载。

Method: 提出自动化场景生成框架，通过分析运行时行为，结合理论模型和供应商经验生成优化的虚拟机管理程序配置；对比基于分析数据和资源分配的两种QoS建模方法；使用选定的QoS模型推导高效资源分配的优化策略。

Result: 通过实际部署展示了框架在资源受限环境中提高集成效率和减少开发时间的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动化场景生成框架能有效帮助汽车供应商在资源受限环境中高效分配硬件资源，提高集成效率并减少开发时间。

Abstract: In the automotive industry, the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) has
  driven a shift toward virtualization-based architectures that consolidate
  diverse automotive workloads on a shared hardware platform. To support this
  evolution, chipset vendors provide board support packages (BSPs), hypervisor
  setups, and resource allocation guidelines. However, adapting these static
  configurations to varying system requirements and workloads remain a
  significant challenge for Tier 1 integrators.
  This paper presents an automated scenario generation framework, which helps
  automotive vendors to allocate hardware resources efficiently across multiple
  VMs. By profiling runtime behavior and integrating both theoretical models
and
  vendor heuristics, the proposed tool generates optimized hypervisor
  configurations tailored to system constraints.
  We compare two main approaches for modeling target QoS based on profiled data
  and resource allocation: domain-guided parametric modeling and deep
  learning-based modeling. We further describe our optimization strategy using
  the selected QoS model to derive efficient resource allocations. Finally, we
  report on real-world deployments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  framework in improving integration efficiency and reducing development time
in
  resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在真实性上能更好重现统计特性；可进行反事实生成；合成反事实数据能提升未来流动性预测模型性能。

Conclusion: DiffVolume为真实可控的LOB交易量生成提供了强大且灵活的框架。

Abstract: Modeling limit order books (LOBs) dynamics is a fundamental problem in market
microstructure research. In particular, generating high-dimensional volume
snapshots with strong temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns remains a
challenging task, despite recent work exploring the application of Generative
Adversarial Networks to LOBs. In this work, we propose a conditional
\textbf{Diff}usion model for the generation of future LOB \textbf{Volume}
snapshots (\textbf{DiffVolume}). We evaluate our model across three axes: (1)
\textit{Realism}, where we show that DiffVolume, conditioned on past volume
history and time of day, better reproduces statistical properties such as
marginal distribution, spatial correlation, and autocorrelation decay; (2)
\textit{Counterfactual generation}, allowing for controllable generation under
hypothetical liquidity scenarios by additionally conditioning on a target
future liquidity profile; and (3) \textit{Downstream prediction}, where we show
that the synthetic counterfactual data from our model improves the performance
of future liquidity forecasting models. Together, these results suggest that
DiffVolume provides a powerful and flexible framework for realistic and
controllable LOB volume generation.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods
with comparable computational cost.

Conclusion: Transformer 并非唯一能有效执行 ICL 的架构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of
predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of
complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical
applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We
benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance
methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:
classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the
Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible
variables.

TL;DR: 介绍反向传播（BP）局限，引出预测编码（PC），以教程风格介绍PC的公式、推导及与其他算法联系，含Python示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BP算法依赖全局误差信号，而生物大脑可能不直接实现BP，PC作为仅用局部信息更新权重的生物可行替代方案受关注，因此要介绍PC。

Method: 以教程风格，从PC数学基础引导读者到实际实现，包括给出Python示例。

Result: 提供了PC的详细介绍，包括其公式、推导，以及与BP和卡尔曼滤波器等算法的联系。

Conclusion: 有助于读者从数学基础到实际操作全面了解PC。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.

TL;DR: 本文提出支持多模态光谱联合推理的大语言模型SpectraLLM，能处理单或多光谱输入进行结构解析，在小分子领域表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构解析方法依赖先验数据库或已知结构信息，复杂结构解析需多光谱联合分析，依赖专家知识且成本高。

Method: 提出SpectraLLM模型，将连续和离散光谱模态集成到共享语义空间，在小分子领域预训练和微调。

Result: 模型在六个标准化公开化学数据集上达到了最先进的性能，显著优于单模态训练的现有方法。

Conclusion: SpectraLLM具有强鲁棒性和泛化能力，多模态推理能力提升了结构预测的准确性。

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the
microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various
disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods
often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making
it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures
typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This
process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by
high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these
challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to
support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of
processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing
end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete
spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to
uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across
spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and
fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six
standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches
trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong
robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its
multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural
prediction.

Method: 提出基于跨度的DP - DBSCAN新定义，设计线性时间算法，利用构造纯差分隐私直方图的线性时间算法。

Result: 提出的线性时间DP - DBSCAN算法在常数维度有三明治质量保证，有匹配的近似比下界，实验验证了算法实际性能。

Conclusion: 基于跨度定义的DP - DBSCAN算法有效可行，对DBSCAN的可视化和分类有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper revisits the DBSCAN problem under differential privacy (DP).
Existing DP-DBSCAN algorithms aim at publishing the cluster labels of the input
points. However, we show that both empirically and theoretically, this approach
cannot offer any utility in the published results. We therefore propose an
alternative definition of DP-DBSCAN based on the notion of spans. We argue that
publishing the spans actually better serves the purposes of visualization and
classification of DBSCAN. Then we present a linear-time DP-DBSCAN algorithm
achieving the sandwich quality guarantee in any constant dimensions, as well as
matching lower bounds on the approximation ratio. A key building block in our
algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for constructing a histogram under
pure-DP, which is of independent interest. Finally, we conducted experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the practical performance of
our DP-DBSCAN algorithm.

Abstract: Blockchains are widely recognized for their immutability, which provides
robust guarantees of data integrity and transparency. However, this same
feature poses significant challenges in real-world situations that require
regulatory compliance, correction of erroneous data, or removal of sensitive
information. Redactable blockchains address the limitations of traditional ones
by enabling controlled, auditable modifications to blockchain data, primarily
through cryptographic mechanisms such as chameleon hash functions and
alternative redaction schemes. This report examines the motivations for
introducing redactability, surveys the cryptographic primitives that enable
secure edits, and analyzes competing approaches and their shortcomings. Special
attention is paid to the practical deployment of redactable blockchains in
private settings, with discussions of use cases in healthcare, finance,
Internet of drones, and federated learning. Finally, the report outlines
further challenges, also in connection with reversible computing, and the
future potential of redactable blockchains in building law-compliant,
trustworthy, and scalable digital infrastructures.

TL;DR: 提出SafeKV框架解决大语言模型推理中全局KV缓存共享的时序侧信道攻击问题，兼具隐私保护和性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局KV缓存共享存在时序侧信道攻击风险，现有防御方法性能下降严重，不适合高吞吐量部署。

Method: SafeKV框架包括混合多层检测管道、统一基数树索引和基于熵的访问监控三个组件。

Result: SafeKV能缓解94% - 97%的时序侧信道攻击，相比单用户隔离方法，提高TTFT达40.58%，吞吐量达2.66倍，减少Qwen3 - 235B的缓存TTFT开销。

Conclusion: SafeKV结合细粒度隐私控制和高缓存重用效率，在保证运行时隐私的同时恢复全局共享的性能优势。

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

Motivation: 数字数据传输规模扩大，隐私问题愈发紧迫，且隐私概念缺乏通用定量度量，图像数据的信息理论保障研究不足。

Method: 在深度学习、信息论和密码学交叉领域，使用互信息（MI）估计器，特别是经验估计器和MINE框架，检测选择性加密图像的信息泄露。

Conclusion: 该工作是图像信息泄露估计的有前景方向。

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Result: 通过参考AI安全地图获得新发现，明确基于AI系统的负面影响与利益相关者负面影响的联系。

Conclusion: 给出一些建议和开放问题，为未来AI安全研究提供指导。

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

Conclusion: 文中未明确得出最终结论，但预期GenAI - based ADS在考虑AATM生成的GOOSE数据集和评估指标时表现更优。

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen系列上的实验表明，EditMF高隐秘性、对模型性能损失可忽略，鲁棒性远超基于LoRA的指纹方法，接近SFT嵌入。

Conclusion: EditMF是安全的大语言模型所有权验证的有效且低开销解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

Conclusion: 分析缓解了对竞争学习算法潜在危害的担忧，有助于卖家、平台和政策制定者决策。

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically
make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When
sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -
the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically
investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and
advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical
strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,
which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.
Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms
can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,
and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases
the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive
prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower
advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our
second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency
keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our
estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different
product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative
interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage
index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we
analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price
adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission
adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the
potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help
sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate
such algorithms.

Conclusion: 战略普及电动汽车可推进孟加拉国可持续交通、经济韧性和公众健康目标。

Abstract: This study examines the economic social and environmental impacts of electric
vehicle adoption in Bangladesh using survey data from 57 respondents and
secondary research. Findings show strong public perception of electric vehicles
as cost effective with ninety three percent agreement and environmentally
beneficial with eighty two point five percent agreement. Electric vehicles have
potential to reduce fuel imports lower operational costs and create over fifty
thousand jobs by 2030. Socially electric vehicles improve mobility for low
income groups with seventy five point four percent agreement and increase
safety although adoption remains mostly in urban areas. Environmentally
electric vehicles could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to thirty percent
per kilometre and lower particulate matter levels by twenty to twenty five
percent in Dhaka along with a three to five decibel reduction in traffic noise.
Main barriers include high purchase costs limited charging infrastructure and
low public awareness of policies. Policy recommendations include tax incentives
solar powered charging stations and battery recycling regulations. This
research concludes that strategic electric vehicle adoption could advance
Bangladesh's sustainable transportation economic resilience and public health
goals.

Motivation: 解决Garrett等人提出的热力学经济模型中存在的关键概念问题。

Method: 定义总生产函数分布，为λ赋予能源柯布 - 道格拉斯函数版本，生成回溯到 -14000 CE 的数据集。

Result: 指出原模型存在各种错误推测，部分曲线被证实，部分因高估有偏差。

Conclusion: 纠正和改进原模型基础问题，能得到实用的全球经济热力学模型。

Abstract: In a series of papers, Garrett, et al, presents a thermodynamic economic
model first laid out in "Are there basic physical constraints on future
anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide?". This model contains a key
conceptual issue that obscures a robust system. This system can link to the
Energy Based Cobb-Douglas equation.
  The key conceptual problem is the belief that $\lambda$, the symbol for
growth in Garrett 2011 would disprove the model if it was not constant.
However, $\lambda$ cannot be a constant in an economic model, because
$\lambda$, with dimension [$\frac{E}{\$ \; GWP}$], represents the aggregate
efficiency of all of the more than 359 million firms (and by extension,
households) making products globally. To clarify it, I define this aggregate
production function distribution as $\Lambda(t) \equiv \sum {\lambda_i(t) \cdot
\frac{P_i}{GWP}}$, and with light algebra assign a version of the Energy Based
Cobb-Douglas (EBDC) function to $\lambda$.
  There are various falsified speculations in the body of work that appear to
mostly follow from the original issue. The 50 year stable relation of $W$ to
$E$ is close, but the trend is not flat. The form and degree to which the "long
arm of history" speculation may be true remains to be fully considered, but is
falsified in the form presented. The speculation in Garrett 2022 that
$\frac{dE}{dt}\rightarrow0$ can cause real GDP to go to zero by inflation is
falsified. By generating a dataset going back to -14,000 CE, the speculative
$W$ curve appears largely confirmed. The $E$ curve is quite far off prior to
1970 back to 1 CE due to overestimation of pre-industrial energy.
  By correcting and improving on the foundation issue of Garrett's yeoman
effort, improving $E$ and some equation presentation formalism, a robust
thermodynamic model of the global economy emerges that is straightforward and
practical.

Result: ASIOI政策使国企环境违规显著减少，有加强内控、增加绿色投资、提升绿色创新三种机制，在监管弱和违规动机强的国企威慑效果更明显。

Conclusion: 问责机制能催化国企主动绿色转型，增强公共治理在可持续转型中的战略作用。

Abstract: Executive accountability is increasingly viewed as a critical mechanism for
improving corporate environmental performance, especially in state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) that dominate high-emission sectors such as energy,
infrastructure, and heavy industry. This study examines whether China's
Accountability System for Irregular Operations and Investments (ASIOI) curbs
environmental violations in SOEs. Exploiting the staggered regional
implementation of ASIOI as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that the policy
leads to a significant reduction in SOE environmental misconduct. Drawing on a
criminology-based cost-benefit framework, we identify three underlying
mechanisms: strengthened internal controls, increased green investment, and
enhanced green innovation. Further analyses reveal that the deterrent effect of
ASIOI is more pronounced in SOEs that exhibit weaker regulatory oversight and
stronger incentives to commit violations. By focusing on politically embedded
SOEs, this study shows how accountability mechanisms can catalyze proactive
green transformation, enhancing the strategic role of public governance in
sustainability transitions.

TL;DR: 分析欧盟两种扩大情景下成员国的先验权力，发现两指数排名不同及成员国权力变化情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欧盟扩大中与欧盟积极谈判入盟国家加入后的情况，评估成员国权力和影响力。

Method: 基于Banzhaf和Shapley - Shubik指数确定成员国先验权力，假设不同联盟评估权力，考虑扩大前后情景。

Result: 两指数给出不同排名；西巴尔干国家加入时小人口成员国获权，36国联盟中成员国失权；部分联盟在36国扩大时更有利。

Conclusion: 欧盟不同扩大情景对成员国权力有不同影响，存在新成员悖论等情况。

Abstract: As of 2022, the European Union has taken several steps regarding enlargement.
We focus on the accession of countries with which the Union is actively
negotiating membership. This is examined under two enlargement scenarios:
first, the enlargement along the lines of the Western Balkan countries, and
second, the accession of a trio (Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia) to the already
enlarged Union. We determine the a priori power of the member states based on
the Banzhaf and Shapley--Shubik indices. Various coalitions are also assumed to
assess the power and influence of member states, considering both pre- and
post-enlargement scenarios. We found a rare case when the two indices give
different rankings. In the case of the Western Balkan countries' accession, the
smaller population member states gain power, presenting an example of the new
member paradox. While in a Union of 36 members, every member state loses some
of their current power. However, some coalitions are better off with the EU36
enlargement than a EU33 one.

Motivation: 研究全球金融危机对经济学学科形态的影响。

Method: 使用多层网络方法，考虑基于共享编辑和共享作者的社会关系，以及基于文献耦合和文本相似度的知识接近性，用相似网络融合集成这四个维度来识别期刊社区。

Result: 对比2006、2012和2019年该领域，发现具有高度的结构连续性。

Conclusion: 尽管危机后研究主题有变化，但期刊间基本的社会和知识关系保持显著稳定，编辑网络仍在塑造等级和使知识生产合法化。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the global financial crisis on the
shape of economics as a discipline by analyzing EconLit-indexed journals from
2006 to 2020 using a multilayer network approach. We consider two types of
social relationships among journals, based on shared editors (interlocking
editorship) and shared authors (interlocking authorship), as well as two forms
of intellectual proximity, derived from bibliographic coupling and textual
similarity. These four dimensions are integrated using Similarity Network
Fusion to produce a unified similarity network from which journal communities
are identified. Comparing the field in 2006, 2012, and 2019 reveals a high
degree of structural continuity. Our findings suggest that, despite changes in
research topics after the crisis, fundamental social and intellectual
relationships among journals have remained remarkably stable. Editorial
networks, in particular, continue to shape hierarchies and legitimize knowledge
production.

Motivation: 结合量子计算和机器学习的混合技术有望解决复杂问题，改进FMA算法以提升其在黑盒优化问题中的性能。

Method: 改进FMA算法，通过从完整数据集中采样子数据集训练机器学习模型，提出SFMA算法，并进行数值基准测试。

Result: SFMA具有探索 - 开发功能，在速度和准确性上优于FMA，使用不同大小的子数据集可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: SFMA在一定规模的黑盒优化问题中有效，有潜力以较低计算成本解决大规模问题。

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

Motivation: 受生物医学成像应用如MRI的切片到体积重建（SVR）启发，解决依赖图像分割、从有限切片重建体积和传统方法计算成本高的问题。

Method: 构建变分目标，结合回归损失和改进的Cahn - Hilliard能量，用神经网络离散相场，蒙特卡罗积分近似目标，ADAM寻找近似变分目标的最小值。

Result: 即使切片数据稀疏有噪，也能在几秒内可靠地生成高质量重建体积。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决相关挑战，快速重建高质量体积。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: A consensus tree is a phylogenetic tree that synthesizes a given collection
of phylogenetic trees, all of which share the same leaf labels but may have
different topologies, typically obtained through bootstrapping. Our research
focuses on creating a consensus tree from a collection of phylogenetic trees,
each detailed with branch-length data. We integrate branch lengths into the
consensus to encapsulate the progression rate of genetic mutations. However,
traditional consensus trees, such as the strict consensus tree, primarily focus
on the topological structure of these trees, often neglecting the informative
value of branch lengths. This oversight disregards a crucial aspect of
evolutionary study and highlights a notable gap in traditional phylogenetic
approaches. In this paper, we extend \textit{PrimConsTree}\footnote{A
preliminary version of this article was presented at \emph{the Fifteenth
International Conference on Bioscience, Biochemistry, and Bioinformatics
(ICBBB~2025)}~(reference~\cite{torquet2005icbbb}).}, a graph-based method for
constructing consensus trees. This algorithm incorporates topological
information, edge frequency, clade frequency, and branch length to construct a
more robust and comprehensive consensus tree. Our adaptation of the well-known
Prim algorithm efficiently identifies the maximum frequency branch and maximum
frequency nodes to build the optimal consensus tree. This strategy was
pre-processed with clustering steps to calibrate the robustness and accuracy of
the consensus tree.\\ \textbf{Availability and implementation:} The source code
of PrimConsTree is freely available on GitHub at

Abstract: GPU singletasking is becoming increasingly inefficient and unsustainable as

challenges and potential solutions, and hope this paper inspires broader
community efforts to build the next-generation GPU compute paradigm grounded in
multitasking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型数学推理基准接近饱和且受训练集污染影响，需新基准。

Method: 引入522个大学竞赛问题的Putnam - AXIOM基准和100个变体的Putnam - AXIOM Variation，使用Teacher - Forced Accuracy指标。

Result: 最强模型在原始集得分41.9%，变体集准确率下降19.6%，其他模型也有下降趋势。

Conclusion: Putnam - AXIOM为评估大语言模型高级数学推理提供严格、抗污染评估框架。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

Result: 评估超30个LLMs，发现即使先进模型也难应对任务复杂度、多样性和多语言特性。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列可作为有价值资源，激励社区关注更具挑战性和实用性的多语言代码生成场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Result: 对并行文本生成方法有了系统分类和分析，了解各方法在速度、质量和效率上的权衡。

Conclusion: 指出并行文本生成的最新进展、开放挑战和未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Result: 在Trust - Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于SOTA模型。

Conclusion: LoDIT具有低延迟效率和不同设置下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

Conclusion: 最先进的CDCR模型进行领域适配并增强推理能力，可有效适配流程工业，提高轮班日志的数据质量和连通性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

Conclusion: 基于形容词的概念表示可作为仇恨与反仇恨言论识别的有效编码，方法经调整可用于其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖持续指令微调，但该领域缺乏严格系统的基准，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出MLLM - CTBench基准，进行多维评估，结合最终答案准确性和细粒度CoT推理质量评估；全面评估算法和训练范式；精心策划任务，选取并组织16个数据集。

Result: 发现模型通用能力强在持续学习中抗遗忘性更好；推理链比最终答案遗忘慢；持续学习算法效果依赖模型能力和任务顺序；强化学习中加入KL散度约束有助于减轻遗忘。

Conclusion: MLLM - CTBench为多模态大语言模型持续指令微调建立了严格标准，为算法设计和评估提供实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Motivation: 确定大语言模型和视觉 - 语言模型中针对心智理论和数学推理任务的因果相关单元。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，通过有针对性的消融评估其因果作用，比较损伤功能选择单元、低激活单元和随机选择单元对下游准确率的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元导致更大性能下降，数学定位器导出的单元对心智理论性能的损害常大于心智理论定位器导出的单元。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性存疑，需要更广泛的刺激集来准确捕获特定任务单元。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力用于资源受限的多智能体控制场景，且开源支持可重复性研究和未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，现有检测方法评估依赖ROUGE，与人类判断不一致，需准确评估检测方法性能。

Method: 进行全面人类研究，使用人类对齐指标LLM - as - Judge评估检测方法。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，用人类对齐指标评估时部分检测方法性能下降达45.9%，简单启发式方法可与复杂检测技术媲美。

Conclusion: 采用语义感知和稳健的评估框架对准确衡量幻觉检测方法性能、确保大语言模型输出可信度至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在宗教领域的可靠性和准确性未被充分研究，需要对其在伊斯兰教法裁决生成方面进行评估。

Method: 引入FiqhQA基准，对大语言模型进行零样本和弃权实验，评估其准确率和弃权能力。

Result: 不同大语言模型、语言和法学派之间表现差异大，GPT - 4o准确率最高，Gemini和Fanar弃权行为更优，所有模型在阿拉伯语中表现下降。

Conclusion: 首次对大语言模型在伊斯兰法学裁决生成进行细粒度评估，强调宗教应用中需特定评估和谨慎部署。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

Result: 所有评估方式都表明关键字增强方法更优，蒸馏提升了机器和人类的可解释性。

Conclusion: TT - XAI为临床决策支持中的可信、可审计AI提供了可扩展途径。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

TL;DR: 研究形态对齐分词方法对不同语言语言模型性能的影响，发现分词算法比形态对齐更影响下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前关于形态对齐分词方法能否提升性能的研究结果有冲突，尤其是针对形态复杂的语言，故开展研究。

Method: 选择多种类型语言，从分词器训练到微调及下游任务评估进行全面评估，关注形态对齐和分词质量两个因素，为泰卢固语创建含词素分割的数据集。

Result: 形态对齐与基于句法的任务性能呈正相关，但分词算法对下游性能影响更大，朴素Unigram分词器多数情况下表现更好，结合形态分割的混合分词器在BPE框架下可提升性能，内在指标与下游性能无关联。

Conclusion: 分词算法比单纯的形态对齐对语言模型下游性能影响更大。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Method: 对20个开源transformer模型进行研究，提出Jacobian steering控制方法来扰动隐藏状态以支持目标令牌。

Result: 发现类似能量的量近乎恒定，随机权重模型比预训练模型更能严格守恒该“能量”，Jacobian steering方法能保持能量恒定，生成内容语义质量更高。

Conclusion: 从力学角度看待transformers为可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

Method: 使用预训练的编解码语言模型，对编码器做小修改以最大化压缩质量。

Result: 2倍压缩时在许多下游任务表现与未压缩相当，8倍压缩时指标仅有小幅度下降。

Conclusion: DeCAL能在可利用预计算密集表示处节省成本，且有进一步广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Method: 提出新的评估框架，通过对高级数学问题进行语言和参数变换创建PutnamGAP数据集，用该数据集评估多个大语言模型。

Result: 18个商业和开源模型在变体问题上性能大幅下降，如O3模型在不同变体上得分降低。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有助于深入理解大语言模型的鲁棒性，为提升其数学推理能力提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 可解释AI能实现抑郁早期诊断，医疗AI在精神病学有前景。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Conclusion: BiasGym框架对安全干预和可解释性研究具有实用价值。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文本转表格任务中处理模糊或特定领域数据、维持表格结构、处理长输入和数值推理方面存在困难。

Method: 提出高效系统，采用将任务分解为可管理子任务和通过迭代自反馈优化生成表格两个关键策略。

Result: 在两个公开的复杂文本转表格生成数据集上，方法取得强于基线的结果。

Conclusion: 自定义任务分解可使模型逐步解决问题并提升表格质量，讨论了迭代自反馈的利弊及性能提升与计算成本的权衡。

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出RetroAttention方法解决大语言模型长上下文推理中KV缓存瓶颈问题，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型长上下文推理受KV缓存瓶颈限制，现有KV缓存压缩方法未解决长解码中的累积注意力误差。

Method: 引入RetroAttention，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目回顾性修正过去的注意力输出，维护轻量级输出缓存。

Result: 在长生成基准测试中，RetroAttention始终优于现有SOTA的KV压缩方法，有效KV暴露增加1.6倍，准确率提高21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention打破了固定注意力输出范式，能持续修正先前近似值，可用于解决大语言模型长上下文推理的KV缓存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Conclusion: 零样本代码生成是表格问答的有效方法。

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法让大语言模型模仿人类特征时只能呈现浅层和不稳定的风格模式，无法精准一致地体现所需特征，需解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出IROTE这一上下文学习方法，借鉴心理学理论，在提示中自动生成并优化包含自我感知经验的文本自我反思，通过迭代最大化信息论目标进行优化。

Result: 在三个人类特征系统的大量实验中，一个由IROTE生成的自我反思能让大语言模型在多种下游任务中稳定模仿目标特征，且持续优于现有强大基线。

Conclusion: IROTE方法可有效解决大语言模型模仿人类特征的表面化问题，实现稳定且可迁移的特征诱导。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个评估RAG - LLMs中重排器的基准，为其未来发展提供有价值的观察和指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Method: 提出可扩展、自动化的LogicIFGen框架从代码函数生成可验证指令，用其构建包含426条富含逻辑指令的LogicIFEval基准。

Result: 当前最先进的LLM在LogicIFEval中遵循指令能力差，多数遵循率低于60%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在遵循富含逻辑指令方面存在显著不足。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

Method: 提出自动化环境构建管道，引入可验证奖励机制，结合标准强化学习算法进行训练。

Result: 在不同规模大语言模型上实验表明，该方法显著提升模型工具使用性能，且不降低其通用能力。

Conclusion: 性能提升源于模型下层MLP参数更新带来的上下文理解和推理能力的提高。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

Conclusion: 为大语言模型中政治偏见的编码方式提供了新见解，并提供了超越表面输出干预的去偏原则性方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Result: 实验表明大语言模型在文化知识空间中编码了西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化受文化偏见影响较小。

Conclusion: 为未来减轻文化偏见和提升大语言模型文化理解的研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Conclusion: ASPD为高效大语言模型并行推理树立了新标杆，为低延迟应用部署铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

Result: 在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中排名第一。

Conclusion: 弱监督结合微调能克服数据稀缺问题，为低资源、多方言语言提供高质量ASR。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Conclusion: 强调扩散大语言模型中时间动态的潜力，提供两种简单有效的利用方法。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 缓解多药联用不良健康影响，准确识别和预测DDI，解决现有方法基于功能基序表示学习受限问题。

Conclusion: ImageDDI在DDI预测中表现良好，具有优势。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Motivation: 现有混合光神经网络存在训练时精度差距、模拟与制造系统差异等问题，且之前方法缺乏泛化性。

Method: 提出任务和硬件无关的管道，训练前基于约束估计模型精度，训练引入神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD），制造后用NTKD指导微调。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置实验中，管道持续提升ONN性能。

Conclusion: 该管道能在预制造模拟和物理实现中实现实际部署。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

Conclusion: MAViS能根据简短提示生成高质量、有表现力的长序列视频，是唯一提供多模态设计输出的框架，可丰富用户灵感和创造力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

Motivation: 现有增强组鲁棒性的方法依赖辅助注释且假设源域和目标域组相同，在现实中不自然且不实用。

Method: 利用类标签中的语义结构（超类信息），通过预训练视觉 - 语言模型引导的基于梯度的注意力机制，分离与超类相关和无关的特征，并促进使用所有超类相关特征进行预测。

Result: 在不同数据集的实验中，该方法在领域泛化任务中显著优于基线，定量指标和定性可视化都有明显提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可在不注释源样本的情况下，实现对更复杂虚假关联的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型微调成本高，且现有适应转移方法跨模型可迁移性有限，计算需求高。

Method: 提出TransMiter，以无监督方式捕捉预训练和微调模型的知识差距，无需反向传播即可跨模型转移知识，模型层数少，推理成本低，少量标注数据可进一步提升性能。

Result: 实验表明TransMiter能在视觉识别任务中有效且高效地转移适应知识，保持不同大小和架构模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TransMiter可有效且高效地跨视觉语言模型转移适应知识，保留泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Motivation: 神经艺术风格转移可创新视觉表达，颜色转移算法在图像处理中重要，希望结合二者优势。

Method: 使用Kullback - Leibler (KL)散度定量评估包括Reinhard全局颜色转移等在内的颜色和亮度直方图匹配算法，估计颜色通道核密度。

Result: 进行了各种实验来评估这些算法的KL值及其颜色直方图用于风格到内容的转移。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但暗示结合神经艺术风格与颜色转移的方法有一定研究价值。

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

TL;DR: 本文提出VISOR方法，通过优化视觉输入实现对视觉语言模型的行为控制，验证其在多项任务中的效果并指出安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型行为控制方法存在易检测、无效或需访问模型内部等问题，需要新方法。

Method: 引入VISOR方法，通过制作通用导向图像诱导目标激活模式实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA - 1.5 - 7B上验证在三项关键对齐任务中的效果，导向图像在正向行为转变上接近导向向量，负向远超导向向量，且不影响无关任务性能。

Conclusion: VISOR方法重新定义了多模态模型控制，凸显了防范视觉导向攻击的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

Result: 显著减少罕见情况相关错误，实验表明该策略提升模型鲁棒性且不引入新错误。

Conclusion: 所提出的针对性修复策略能有效提升视觉识别深度学习模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Conclusion: 将基于坐标的神经表示与高效体积压缩结合，提供可扩展无结构解决方案。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Conclusion: MMIF - AMIN方法在多模态医学图像融合及拓展任务中有效且表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为缩小深度伪造检测器实验室训练和现实部署差距提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，尤其适用于压缩视频内容领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its

from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

*Zhiqiang Yang,Renshuai Tao,Xiaolong Zheng,Guodong Yang,Chunjie Zhang*

TL;DR: 现有深度伪造检测方法依赖标注数据，标注困难，本文提出DPGNet，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法依赖标注数据，标注耗时且不可靠，需有效利用大规模未标注数据的方法。

Method: 提出DPGNet，含文本引导跨域对齐和课程驱动伪标签生成两个核心模块，还通过跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个流行数据集上实验，DPGNet比现有最优方法性能高6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet能有效利用未标注数据，应对深度伪造日益逼真带来的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，对数据收集困难的现实应用有价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 研究允许非参与者对公共利益产生正负影响时自愿参与的作用，发现非参与者的正负外部性对利他惩罚主导的协同阈值有不同影响，促进利他惩罚需考虑非参与者作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往假设非参与者对公共利益无影响，鉴于自愿参与的分散性，非参与者可能影响公共利益，故重新审视自愿参与的作用。

Method: 在充分混合的有限群体中进行进化分析。

Result: 非参与者的正外部性降低利他惩罚主导所需的协同阈值，负外部性提高该阈值；正影响时需激励非参与，负影响时即便抑制非参与利他惩罚也能持续。

Conclusion: 促进利他惩罚必须考虑非参与者的积极作用，其影响会决定集体结果。

Abstract: While voluntary participation is a key mechanism that enables altruistic
punishment to emerge, its explanatory power typically rests on the common
assumption that non-participants have no impact on the public good. Yet, given
the decentralized nature of voluntary participation, opting out does not
necessarily preclude individuals from influencing the public good. Here, we
revisit the role of voluntary participation by allowing non-participants to
exert either positive or negative impacts on the public good. Using
evolutionary analysis in a well-mixed finite population, we find that positive
externalities from non-participants lower the synergy threshold required for
altruistic punishment to dominate. In contrast, negative externalities raise
this threshold, making altruistic punishment harder to sustain. Notably, when
non-participants have positive impacts, altruistic punishment thrives only if
non-participation is incentivized, whereas under negative impacts, it can
persist even when non-participation is discouraged. Our findings reveal that
efforts to promote altruistic punishment must account for the active role of
non-participants, whose influence can make or break collective outcomes.

Motivation: 解决调解者不知代理人偏好时，如何根据份额构建公平分配方案的问题。

Method: 通过理论证明，分析在有非理性份额情况下的分配情况。

Result: 若有一个份额为非理性数，调解者为构建符合份额的分配，需进行任意大量的查询。

Conclusion: 在有非理性份额时，构建符合份额的分配方案需大量查询，不受偏好影响。

Abstract: A perfectly divisible cake is to be divided among a group of agents. Each
agent is entitled to a share between zero and one, and these entitlements are
compatible in that they sum to one. The mediator does not know the preferences
of the agents, but can query the agents to make cuts and appraise slices in
order to learn. We prove that if one of the entitlements is irrational, then
the mediator must use a protocol that involves an arbitrarily large number of
queries in order to construct an allocation that respects the entitlements
regardless of preferences.

Abstract: Contour trees offer an abstract representation of the level set topology in
scalar fields and are widely used in topological data analysis and
visualization. However, applying contour trees to large-scale scientific
datasets remains challenging due to scalability limitations. Recent
developments in distributed hierarchical contour trees have addressed these
challenges by enabling scalable computation across distributed systems.
Building on these structures, advanced analytical tasks -- such as volumetric
branch decomposition and contour extraction -- have been introduced to
facilitate large-scale scientific analysis. Despite these advancements, such
analytical tasks substantially increase memory usage, which hampers
scalability. In this paper, we propose a pre-simplification strategy to
significantly reduce the memory overhead associated with analytical tasks on
distributed hierarchical contour trees. We demonstrate enhanced scalability
through strong scaling experiments, constructing the largest known contour tree
-- comprising over half a trillion nodes with complex topology -- in under 15
minutes on a dataset containing 550 billion elements.

Method: 提出构建任意大小单峰玩具UBQP的方法，用同伦凸变换框架平滑原始UBQP，引入LSILS算法框架，提出并行协作变体PC - LSILS。

Result: 实验分析表明LSILS对各种UBQP实例有效，PC - LSILS提高了同伦凸变换的平滑性能和算法整体性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法和算法对解决UBQP和TSP问题有效，能提升算法性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Result: 由'+/-1'构造矩阵的玩具UBQP景观最平坦，随机构造矩阵的玩具UBQP景观最不平坦；使用由'+/-i'构造矩阵的玩具UBQP的LSILS算法最有效，随机构造矩阵的玩具UBQP效果最差。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于详细理解景观平滑技术在优化UBQP中的应用。

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

Motivation: 寻找计算π的低Lehmer测度的Machin类反正切关系，使大规模搜索变得可行。

Method: 将PSLQ整数关系算法与基于高斯整数代数结构的数论过滤器相结合进行搜索，并通过算法扩展生成新的更长公式。

Result: 发现新的5项和6项记录低Lehmer测度（λ = 1.4572, λ = 1.3291）的关系。

Conclusion: 受限PSLQ搜索和算法扩展的结合方法为未来探索提供了可靠途径。

Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$,
with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a
framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ
integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the
algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable.
Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures
($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered
relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through
algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and
algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同细胞环境中基因扰动效应是功能基因组学挑战，现有单细胞技术数据收集成本高，计算方法可扩展性和泛化性有限。

Method: 提出CFM - GP方法，学习未扰动和扰动基因表达分布间连续、时间相关的转换，使用流匹配目标来捕获扰动动态。

Result: 在五个数据集上，CFM - GP在R平方和Spearman相关性上始终优于最先进基线，通路富集分析证实恢复关键生物通路。

Conclusion: CFM - GP是一种可扩展的跨细胞类型基因扰动预测解决方案，具有鲁棒性和生物学保真度。

Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a
central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for
therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable
high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such
data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type.
Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type,
limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell
type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous,
time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression
distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict
across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling,
CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a
scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta
stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta
stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation,
and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.
These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a
scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.

TL;DR: 提出分布式可扩展的DMA架构XDMA，解决异构加速器内存数据移动问题，在性能、功耗等方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI工作负载依赖异构加速器，传统DMA引擎在数据布局转换时效率低，存在控制开销大、片上互连利用率低的问题。

Method: 提出XDMA架构，包括作为前端的数据流式引擎、分布式DMA架构和灵活插件。

Result: 在合成工作负载中，XDMA链路利用率比基于软件的实现高151.2x/8.2x；在实际应用中，比现有技术的DMA加速器平均提速2.3倍；面积开销小于2%，功耗为系统的17%。

Conclusion: 协同优化内存访问、布局转换和互连协议是释放异构多加速器片上系统性能的关键。

Abstract: As modern AI workloads increasingly rely on heterogeneous accelerators,
ensuring high-bandwidth and layout-flexible data movements between accelerator
memories has become a pressing challenge. Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines
promise high bandwidth utilization for data movements but are typically optimal
only for contiguous memory access, thus requiring additional software loops for
data layout transformations. This, in turn, leads to excessive control overhead
and underutilized on-chip interconnects. To overcome this inefficiency, we
present XDMA, a distributed and extensible DMA architecture that enables
layout-flexible data movements with high link utilization. We introduce three
key innovations: (1) a data streaming engine as XDMA Frontend, replacing
software address generators with hardware ones; (2) a distributed DMA
architecture that maximizes link utilization and separates configuration from
data transfer; (3) flexible plugins for XDMA enabling on-the-fly data
manipulation during data transfers. XDMA demonstrates up to 151.2x/8.2x higher
link utilization than software-based implementations in synthetic workloads and
achieves 2.3x average speedup over accelerators with SoTA DMA in real-world
applications. Our design incurs <2% area overhead over SoTA DMA solutions while
consuming 17% of system power. XDMA proves that co-optimizing memory access,
layout transformation, and interconnect protocols is key to unlocking
heterogeneous multi-accelerator SoC performance.

Method: 通过算法 - 硬件协同设计，在子阵列内部署并行搜索引擎，重新设计哈希表，结合子阵列级并行和秩级处理。

Result: JSPIM在连接查询上比DuckDB有400x - 1000x加速，在完整SSB基准测试中吞吐量提升2.5x。

Conclusion: JSPIM有效解决现有问题，提升数据库查询性能，且数据开销和芯片面积增加小。

Abstract: Database applications are increasingly bottlenecked by memory bandwidth and
latency due to the memory wall and the limited scalability of DRAM. Join
queries, central to analytical workloads, require intensive memory access and
are particularly vulnerable to inefficiencies in data movement. While
Processing-in-Memory (PIM) offers a promising solution, existing designs
typically reuse CPU-oriented join algorithms, limiting parallelism and
incurring costly inter-chip communication. Additionally, data skew, a main
challenge in CPU-based joins, remains unresolved in current PIM architectures.
  We introduce JSPIM, a PIM module that accelerates hash join and, by
extension, corresponding select queries through algorithm-hardware co-design.
JSPIM deploys parallel search engines within each subarray and redesigns hash
tables to achieve O(1) lookups, fully exploiting PIM's fine-grained
parallelism. To mitigate skew, our design integrates subarray-level parallelism
with rank-level processing, eliminating redundant off-chip transfers.
Evaluations show JSPIM delivers 400x to 1000x speedup on join queries versus
DuckDB. When paired with DuckDB for the full SSB benchmark, JSPIM achieves an
overall 2.5x throughput improvement (individual query gains of 1.1x to 28x), at
just a 7% data overhead and 2.1% per-rank PIM-enabled chip area increase.

Method: 提出OISMA架构，利用准随机计算域（Bent - Pyramid系统）的计算简单性，将正常内存读取转换为原位随机乘法操作，用积累外围积累输出乘法位流实现矩阵乘法功能。

Result: 广泛的矩阵乘法基准测试表明，Bent - Pyramid系统平均相对Frobenius误差降低；4KB容量的1T1R OISMA阵列在50MHz下有较好的能量和面积效率；技术节点从180nm缩至22nm时，能效和面积效率显著提升。

Conclusion: OISMA架构在精度、能效和面积效率方面表现良好，技术节点缩小时有显著优势，是有潜力的内存计算架构。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant
up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads
representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing
architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both
digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from
various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy
efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing
architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic
computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,
scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory
read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a
negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output
multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.
Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the
accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4
to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average
relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared
to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB
capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house
RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for
energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area
of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a
significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one
order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication
in-memory computing architectures.

Motivation: 肌腱驱动机器人手学习控制策略有挑战，腕戴式表面肌电图（sEMG）传感器可捕捉手部运动，但将sEMG信号映射到肌腱控制是难题。

Method: 引入扩展emg2pose数据集的大规模EMG - 肌腱控制数据集，提供三个基线回归模型，提出新的基于扩散的回归模型。

Result: 数据集包含193名受试者、370小时和29个阶段的多样手势记录，结合了MyoSuite MyoHand模型得出的肌腱控制信号。

Conclusion: 该数据集和建模框架为肌腱驱动的灵巧机器人操作迈出重要一步，为机器人手可扩展和准确的肌腱控制奠定基础。

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Motivation: 传统探索方法依赖大量奖励工程、专家演示或课程学习，限制了泛化性，需新方法减少人力。

Method: 提出SDAX框架，利用无监督技能发现获取技能，用双层优化过程动态调节探索程度。

Result: 使四足机器人获得爬行、攀爬、跳跃等敏捷行为，策略可转移到现实硬件。

Conclusion: SDAX能有效减少人力，让机器人自主学习并将学习成果应用到现实。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

Conclusion: 所提方法有助于便利店机器人实现平滑、自适应和数据驱动的取放操作。

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR)框架，用于通过行为的分层生成模型推断潜在程序，在连续操作任务上表现优于现有视觉语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从单一不完美示范中泛化，而机器人需大量示例且泛化能力差，问题源于无法恢复支撑智能行为的潜在解释。

Method: 引入RIR框架，将少样本模仿视为贝叶斯程序归纳，通过视觉语言模型提出任务假设，规划器评估假设可能性，得出可执行程序的后验。

Result: 在连续操作任务上，RIR仅用一个示范就能推断任务结构并泛化到新场景，优于现有视觉语言模型基线。

Conclusion: RIR框架在少样本模仿学习的泛化能力上有显著优势。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

TL;DR: 提出用于5G及未来信道估计的Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network (ReQuestNet)，含两子单元，性能超MMSE且泛化性好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统线性MMSE解决方案的局限性，简化信道估计（CE）流程，处理无线通信系统中的多种实际情况。

Method: 构建由CoarseNet和RefinementNet组成的ReQuestNet，CoarseNet进行每PRG、每收发流的信道估计，RefinementNet利用相关性细化估计结果。

Result: 仿真显示ReQuestNet在多种信道条件和延迟 - 多普勒轮廓下显著优于MMSE CE，高SNR时增益达10dB，能有效泛化到未见信道轮廓。

Conclusion: ReQuestNet是一种有效的信道估计架构，可高效利用相关性，适用于动态PRG BS和不同发射层分配情况。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

Result: 半监督信道绘图在构建扩展城市环境的空间一致图表性能显著，静态DNT定位误差约4.5米，动态DNT约6米。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于DNT辅助的信道绘图和定位。

Abstract: Wireless communication systems can significantly benefit from the
availability of spatially consistent representations of the wireless channel to
efficiently perform a wide range of communication tasks. Towards this purpose,
channel charting has been introduced as an effective unsupervised learning
technique to achieve both locally and globally consistent radio maps. In this
letter, we propose Chartwin, a case study on the integration of
localization-oriented channel charting with dynamic Digital Network Twins
(DNTs). Numerical results showcase the significant performance of
semi-supervised channel charting in constructing a spatially consistent chart
of the considered extended urban environment. The considered method results in
$\approx$ 4.5 m localization error for the static DNT and $\approx$ 6 m in the
dynamic DNT, fostering DNT-aided channel charting and localization.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备心率数据存在缺失值，传统评估指标无法捕捉生理信号复杂统计结构。

Method: 综合运用预测准确性指标和统计距离度量方法，评估线性插值、KNN、PCHIP和B样条四种插补方法。

Result: 分析揭示现有插补方法存在局限，缺乏评估生理信号插补质量的可靠框架。

Conclusion: 提出开发综合评估指标以评估插补性能的基础框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring
of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early
detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals,
heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and
managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events
such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from
missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various
imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has
been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,
which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these
metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in
physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a
comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear
interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their
performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance
measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance
(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab
Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals
limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust
framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally,
this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation
metric to assess imputation performance.

Method: 引入Capybara系统，利用文本转3D生成AI模型创建虚拟角色和配饰，通过自动绑定和身体跟踪实现角色动画，用视觉AI模型识别物理对象以编程交互行为，还进行用户研究。

Result: 通过一系列新颖AR体验展示了Capybara的表现力，用户研究发现它能让儿童利用AI创作个性化且吸引人的AR体验。

Conclusion: Capybara可使儿童利用AI创作无缝连接虚拟与现实世界的个性化、吸引人的AR体验。

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would
inevitably lead to negative environmental effects.

TL;DR: 本文利用大语言模型（LLMs）对美国民众20年里对中国态度演变进行建模，提出框架并揭示态度形成影响因素，为基于LLMs的大规模、长期、跨境社会认知行为建模提供新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前多数研究聚焦特定孤立事件或国内观点，本文旨在首次对一国民众对另一国的大规模态度演变进行建模，即美国民众对中国的态度演变。

Method: 提出整合媒体数据收集、用户画像创建和意见更新认知架构的框架；利用LLMs引入去偏媒体曝光，提取中性事件；引入魔鬼代言人代理。

Result: 验证了框架架构的有效性，揭示了有偏见的框架和选择偏差对态度形成的影响。

Conclusion: 为基于LLMs的大规模、长期、跨境社会认知行为建模提供新范式，有助于理解国际偏见形成，对减少偏见和促进跨文化包容有意义。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a
long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to
recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works
focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views
within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution
of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'
perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we
propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile
creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully
reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period
from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased
media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news
contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a
devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to
positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way
Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond
validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing
and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new
paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,
long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation
of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers
to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately
contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural
tolerance.

Motivation: 观察到再生核希尔伯特空间中方向分量估计质量差异大，前导特征方向在有限样本中估计更可靠，希望提高检验功效和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用MMD统计量谱分解识别和利用估计良好的方向分量，聚合多核信息，开发高效的乘子自助法近似临界值。

Result: 广泛模拟和微阵列数据集实证研究表明，该方法能维持名义一类错误率，且功效优于其他基于MMD的检验。

Conclusion: 提出的基于核的两样本检验方法在高维不平衡样本设置中有更高功效和更好鲁棒性，计算过程高效。

Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based two-sample test that leverages the spectral
decomposition of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to identify and
utilize well-estimated directional components in reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). Our approach is motivated by the observation that the estimation
quality of these components varies significantly, with leading eigen-directions
being more reliably estimated in finite samples. By focusing on these
directions and aggregating information across multiple kernels, the proposed
test achieves higher power and improved robustness, especially in
high-dimensional and unbalanced sample settings. We further develop a
computationally efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating
critical values, which is theoretically justified and significantly faster than
permutation-based alternatives. Extensive simulations and empirical studies on
microarray datasets demonstrate that our method maintains the nominal Type I
error rate and delivers superior power compared to other existing MMD-based
tests.

Result: 得到$ho_{curve}$为平均因果效应提供界限，能识别使平均因果效应无效的混杂强度，可推导平均因果效应的后验分布和可信区间。

Conclusion: 通过模拟和真实世界数据实验，证明敏感性分析方法有益。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding
in causal inference. The method builds on a copula-based causal graphical
normalizing flow that we term $\rho$-GNF, where $\rho \in [-1,+1]$ is the
sensitivity parameter. The parameter represents the non-causal association
between exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as
a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate
the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, accounting for various
confounding strengths. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we term the
$\rho_{curve}$, which provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of
assumed $\rho$ values. The $\rho_{curve}$ also enables scholars to identify the
confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We also propose a Bayesian
version of our sensitivity analysis method. Assuming a prior over the
sensitivity parameter $\rho$ enables us to derive the posterior distribution
over the ACE, which enables us to derive credible intervals. Finally,
leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the
benefits of our sensitivity analysis method.

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上训练和评估，MAE从14.14 Hz降至13.69 Hz，VDE提高38.2%。

Conclusion: EGGCodec优于现有F0提取方案，消融实验验证了各组件的贡献。

Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered
for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We
propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced
relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a
time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike
conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec
leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By
removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training
process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance
degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive
evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0
extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69
Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

TL;DR: 提出用于边缘辅助移动增强现实（MAR）的代理驱动通信服务供应方法，能减少通信开销并保证体验质量，模拟结果显示优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少 MAR 设备与边缘服务器间的通信开销，同时保证用户体验质量。

Method: 建立由大语言模型驱动的数字代理，弥补 MAR 服务和网络域的数据与功能差距；开发用户级 QoE 建模方法，实现个性化代理驱动的通信资源管理。

Result: 提出的方法在用户级 QoE 建模准确性和通信资源效率上优于传统基于 LLM 的 QoE 感知服务供应方法。

Conclusion: 所提的代理驱动通信服务供应方法有效且性能更优。

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出用于动态嘈杂户外环境健康监测的DUAL - Health框架，经实验验证其在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统户外健康监测依赖静态多模态深度学习框架有局限，多模态大语言模型虽有潜力但面临传感器数据噪声、难以实现鲁棒多模态融合和准确恢复缺失数据等挑战。

Method: 提出DUAL - Health框架，包括准确量化模态不确定性、根据量化校准的不确定性定制融合权重、在共同语义空间中对齐模态分布。

Result: 广泛实验表明DUAL - Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DUAL - Health框架能有效解决户外健康监测中多模态大语言模型面临的挑战，提升监测性能。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural audio processing has unlocked novel methods of sound transformation
and synthesis, yet integrating deep learning models into digital audio
workstations (DAWs) remains challenging due to real-time / neural network
inference constraints and the complexities of plugin development. In this
paper, we introduce the Neutone SDK: an open source framework that streamlines
the deployment of PyTorch-based neural audio models for both real-time and
offline applications. By encapsulating common challenges such as variable
buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter
handling within a unified, model-agnostic interface, our framework enables
seamless interoperability between neural models and host plugins while allowing
users to work entirely in Python. We provide a technical overview of the
interfaces needed to accomplish this, as well as the corresponding SDK
implementations. We also demonstrate the SDK's versatility across applications
such as audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, as well
as its adoption by researchers, educators, companies, and artists alike. The

Method: 使用位置无关点击声作触发器，针对多达50个说话人，改变语音和触发器信噪比，在说话人验证任务中基于余弦相似度选最相似训练说话人作目标。

Result: 多目标攻击成功率达95.04%，说话人验证任务中目标和注册说话人对高度相似时成功率达90%。

Conclusion: 所提多目标后门攻击方法在说话人识别和验证任务中有效，存在隐蔽性和有效性的权衡。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker
identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike
previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers
simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more
realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech
and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We
further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the
most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The
attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly
similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

Motivation: 医疗领域应用ML模型需大量数据，疫情使数据稀缺，训练模型困难，为提高COVID - 19检测模型准确性，且考虑疫情时的时间敏感性。

Method: 先在Coughvid数据集的平衡子集上训练CNN，建立基线；再训练ACGAN有条件地生成健康和COVID - 19咳嗽的合成梅尔频谱图，用其扩充CNN分类器的训练数据集。

Result: CNN初始测试准确率为72%，用合成数据扩充训练集后，测试准确率达到75%。

Conclusion: 指出训练中存在的混乱和不一致情况，并给出检测和处理这些问题的见解。

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,
it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the
ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.
Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the
recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature
of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,
many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train
better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To
accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses
on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the
accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced
subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test
accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN
(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel
Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to
augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new
test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and
inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such
shortcomings.

TL;DR: 现有音频生成系统评估方法有局限，提出QAMRO框架，表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频生成系统评估方法将MOS预测作为回归问题，标准回归损失忽略感知判断的相对性，评估具有挑战性。

Method: 引入QAMRO框架，整合不同视角的回归目标，利用CLAP和Audiobox - Aesthetics等预训练模型，在官方AudioMOS Challenge 2025数据集上训练。

Result: 在所有维度上与人类评估有更好的一致性，显著优于强大的基线模型。

Conclusion: QAMRO框架能有效解决现有音频生成系统评估方法的局限，提升评估效果。

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM),
text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the
subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods
treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard
regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address
this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin
Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives
from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and
prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text
models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the
official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment
with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming
robust baseline models.

Result: 生产者和消费者共享个人主义、全球主义、技术自由主义且规避道德的意识形态。

Conclusion: 这种意识形态混淆个人责任，改变了音乐及音乐实践本质以适应生成结果。

Abstract: AI systems for music generation are increasingly common and easy to use,
granting people without any musical background the ability to create music.
Because of this, generative-AI has been marketed and celebrated as a means of
democratizing music making. However, inclusivity often functions as marketable
rhetoric rather than a genuine guiding principle in these industry settings. In
this paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the
public as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they
are rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to
investigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and
adoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on
democratization. A combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography is
used to examine patterns and incongruities in rhetoric when positioned against
product functionality. The results are then collated to develop a nuanced,
contextual discussion. The shared ideology we map between producers and
consumers is individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive.
It is a 'total ideology' which obfuscates individual responsibility, and
through which the nature of music and musical practice is transfigured to suit
generative outcomes.

Motivation: 解决预训练ASR模型在不同录音通道输入音频时性能大幅下降的问题，认为不同通道语音特征变化影响性能。

Method: 提出归一化技术，使ASR模型内部特征表示与干净参考通道的特征表示对齐。

Result: 该方法显著提升了在未见通道和语言上的ASR性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效减轻通道变化的影响，具备跨通道和语言差异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

Method: 利用2D扩散先验优化以MLP表示的光场，微调预训练图像扩散模型通过联合修复多个铬球作为光探测器来预测多位置光照。

Result: 在室内单图像或视频光照估计中表现优于对比基线，展示了野外视频时空一致光照估计结果。

Conclusion: 所提方法在室内光照估计和野外视频时空一致光照估计上有效。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

Motivation: 现有自回归方法生成网格的中间步骤代表不完整结构，需要一种能连续控制细节生成的方法。

Method: 借鉴渐进网格，将生成过程重新表述为边折叠的逆过程（顶点分裂），并通过生成模型学习。

Result: VertexRegen生成的网格质量与现有最先进方法相当，且能随时停止生成以产生不同细节级别的有效网格。

Conclusion: VertexRegen是一种有效的网格生成框架，能实现连续细节级别的网格生成并具有随时生成的灵活性。

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决相关问题，在实时渲染全局光照方面表现良好。

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

Method: 利用现代多模态扩散变压器（MM - DiT）的注意力机制，通过有针对性地操纵注意力图和值标记来分离结构和颜色。

Result: 在SD3和FLUX.1 - dev上实验显示ColorCtrl在编辑质量和一致性上超现有无训练方法，在一致性上超商业模型，扩展到视频模型优势明显，也适用于指令编辑扩散模型。

Conclusion: ColorCtrl是一种有效、通用的无训练色彩编辑方法，能实现精准一致的色彩编辑。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

Conclusion: AI有能力使高质量评估更易获取，让师生受益。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching
and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and
scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of
customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been
significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using
artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the
psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling
this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in
effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative
refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing,
and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision.
We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field
study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics,
chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States,
comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory
(IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions
performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized
exams. Our results illustrate the power of AI to make high-quality assessments
more readily available, benefiting both teachers and students.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields
and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and
challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to
make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate
related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the
conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular
culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects.
Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through
the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just
like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a
separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly,
readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may
interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as
depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first.

Conclusion: 该框架通过扩展道德复杂性概念，能支持现实高风险情境下的道德决策。

Abstract: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of
a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral
situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn
from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine
Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by
outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action
under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is
not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive
deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled
manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the
conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a
moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support
real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative
reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to
enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the
dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through
top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh
competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific
normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By
extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting
beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the
integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally
grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.

Result: 方法能定量恢复以往定性辩论中的细微见解，现有算法公平性方法常忽略这些。

Conclusion: 仅围绕敏感属性的缓解策略可能引入新的结构性不公正，兼顾敏感属性和社会决定因素有助于全面理解公平。

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any
specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have
direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous
algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,
often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap
by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped
largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To
demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a
concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social
determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma
distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact
individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers
findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,
that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings
suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes
may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination.
Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a
more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by
individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual
environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness
effectively and transparently.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究主要AI公司如何履行自愿承诺。

Method: 基于2023年主要AI公司对白宫的八项自愿承诺制定详细评分标准，对公司公开披露行为打分。

Result: 公司表现异质性大，最高分（OpenAI）83%，平均52%；模型权重安全承诺表现差，平均17%，16家公司中11家得0分。

Conclusion: 未来AI治理应纠正结构缺陷，公司应主动披露履约情况且可验证；提供三条政策建议促进企业AI治理。

Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as
demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7,
from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their
commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by
developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the
White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the
highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the
average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate
systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security
with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this
commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future
AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public
commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments
to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To
advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed
recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI
supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI
governance initiatives worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能需健康数据，但GDPR应用的不确定性限制合成数据优势，需明确合成数据在GDPR下的分类。

Method: 通过对相关法律来源的系统分析和实证研究，生成合成数据并模拟推理攻击来研究残余识别风险。

Result: 合成数据可能是匿名的，但对于合理可能的风险构成存在不确定性。

Conclusion: 为促进创新，需要更清晰的法规来平衡隐私保护和医疗AI的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but
it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through
machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while
preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden,
limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of
relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether
synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study
investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data
and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical
identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous,
depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what
constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for
clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in
healthcare.

Conclusion: 提出适用于领域专家有限的新共同设计框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and
behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in
resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the
needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local
context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers
possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face
severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage
in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced
community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain
expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case
study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at
a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients'
social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we
found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and
precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the
LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a
novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts,
in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into
individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently
refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it
must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity
and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how
things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on
behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but
not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and
the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both
disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does
what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However,
to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of
loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are
central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between
implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI,
wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification.
Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents
pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to
account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In
surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent
development and deployment.

Conclusion: 考虑部署成本来源以及观察到的与模型中的风险集中度，可调和先前文献差异，研究结果为考虑特定应用和地理因素的基于AI的社会服务解决方案部署提供参考。

Abstract: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target
either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g.,
neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates
conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when
inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study
and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based
on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality
affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the
RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the
effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based
approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more
versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to
eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results
demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed
through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area
with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in
the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of
deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our
results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision
that account for particular applications and geographies.

Abstract: Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various
organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models
(LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and
institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models
(eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and
academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting
raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of
contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is
missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs,
which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their
infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational
sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates
that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step
jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application
in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and
industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and
institutions.

Conclusion: 将城市理论嵌入商业土地利用建模可大幅提升捕捉其增减的能力，有助于考虑灾害累积影响和经济活动模式变化的土地利用研究。

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent
questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,
weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is
whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,
privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten
leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on
industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the
International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was
tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to
IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such
as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the
standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial
expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results
highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer
practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists
assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This
paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI
advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on
human-centric evaluations.

Conclusion: 得到完全可解释的数据驱动核质量模型。

Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently
nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics
research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this
task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However,
the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are
only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires
extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are
largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to
assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision
for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and
explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation
form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link
the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each
isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be
factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms
corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).
Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost
entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result
is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.
