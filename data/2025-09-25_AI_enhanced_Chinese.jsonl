The optimized sparse-retrieval\nbaseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To\nsurpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a\nfirst stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using\nin-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and\nrich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT\ncross-encoder.

Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate\nthat WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,\nmore stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u9891\u57df\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faWFDiffuser\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u9891\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u79fb\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWFDiffuser\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u77ed\u65f6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u53d6\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u9891\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cWFDiffuser\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9891\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WFDiffuser\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The recent results about\nalpha-acyclic schemas and annotated relations give rise to results about\nbeta-acyclic schemas and annotated relations, since a schema is beta-acyclic if\nand only if every sub-schema of it is alpha-acyclic. Here, we study\ngamma-acyclic schemas and annotated relations. Our main finding is that the\ndesirable semantic properties of gamma-acyclic schemas extend to annotated\nrelations, provided the annotations come from a positive commutative monoid\nthat has the transportation property. Furthermore, the results reported here\nshed light on the role of the join of two standard relations, Specifically, our\nresults reveal that the only relevant property of the join of two standard\nrelations is that it is a witness to the consistency of the two relations,\nprovided that these two relations are consistent. For the more abstract setting\nof annotated relations, this property of the standard join is captured by the\nnotion of a consistency witness function, a notion which we systematically\ninvestigate in this work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u03b3-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u03b3-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5173\u7cfb\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c1\u8bc1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9\u03b1-\u65e0\u73af\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u03b2-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u03b3-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u03b1\u3001\u03b2-\u65e0\u73af\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u03b3-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c1\u8bc1\u51fd\u6570\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u03b3-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u6ce8\u91ca\u6765\u81ea\u6709\u4f20\u8f93\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6362\u5e7a\u534a\u7fa4\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u5173\u7cfb\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u7531\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c1\u8bc1\u51fd\u6570\u4f53\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03b3-\u65e0\u73af\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c1\u8bc1\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u6355\u83b7\u6807\u51c6\u8fde\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

While models excel at isolated tasks, the\ncomputational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain\npoorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational\ncognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context\nSaturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key\nmechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive\nEvaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these\nload factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N\n= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant\nperformance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller\nopen-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\nexhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all\nconditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task.

Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell\n(KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom\nbody circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC\nto mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability\nto distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that\nincorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model,\nwe generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection\nneuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number\nof KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights,\namong other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs\nconsistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The\ndevelopmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's\noutput. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating\ndevelopmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning\ncapacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON\nsynaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation\nexperiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed\nrewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit.

The first method\nleverages state-of-the-art techniques in manifold fitting to accurately\napproximate the manifold where the data resides within the ambient\nhigh-dimensional space.

Existing scheduling\npolicies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,\nthat overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'\nlong-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several\npsychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).\n  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on\nthree key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and\noperant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on\nthe mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a\nsimple linear search given the above algorithm.

We formulate an\noptimization problem to interleave training and inferencing minibatches, and\ndecide the device power mode and inference minibatch size, while maximizing the\ntraining throughput and staying within latency and power budgets, with modest\nprofiling costs. We propose GMD, an efficient multi-dimensional gradient\ndescent search which profiles just $15$ power modes; and ALS, an Active\nLearning technique which identifies reusable Pareto-optimal power modes, but\nprofiles $50$--$150$ power modes. We evaluate these within our Fulcrum\nscheduler for $273,000+$ configurations across $15$ DNN workloads. We also\nevaluate our strategies on dynamic arrival inference and concurrent inferences.\nALS and GMD outperform simpler and more complex baselines with larger-scale\nprofiling.

Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate\noutputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a\nbreakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to\naddress these issues: the integration of a secondary, \"metacognitive\" layer\nthat actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,\nthis layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined\nset of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon\npredicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human\nhandoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's \"thought\nprocess\" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical\nanalysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly\nincreases the overall task success rate.

We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator\nmust dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a parallelized multi-goal A*\nsearch implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system\nachieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300\nkm away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These\nresults show that when round-trip latency remains within the\ntens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck,\nenabling avoidance well below human reaction times.

The purpose of this paper is to\nestablish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more\neffective and practical manner.

These voids are\nincreasingly encountered not on traditional search engines alone, but on social\nmedia platforms, which have gradually morphed into informal search engines for\nmillions of people. In this paper, we introduce the phenomenon of data\nhorizons: a critical boundary where algorithmic structures begin to degrade the\nrelevance and reliability of search results. Unlike the core of a data void,\nwhich is often exploited by bad actors to spread misinformation, the data\nhorizon marks the critical space where systemic factors, such as linguistic\nunderrepresentation, algorithmic amplification, and socio-cultural mismatch,\ncreate conditions of informational instability. Focusing on Tigrinya and\nAmharic as languages of study, we evaluate (1) the common characteristics of\nsearch results for health queries, (2) the quality and credibility of health\ninformation, and (3) characteristics of search results that diverge from their\nqueries.

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale.

Our approach\nbegins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both\nreasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and\nreasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust\nbehavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.\nWe then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP\nactivations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,\nattack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to\nlearn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial\ncharacteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted\nmanipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective\nrefusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving\nhelpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in both safety controllability and response\ninterpretability without compromising utility.

In this study, we examine uncertainty\nquantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic\nforecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In\nparticular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment\nthem with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal\nprediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the\nLASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile\nregression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional\nheteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of\nperformance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms\nof probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification\nmethod.

E.g., in a clinical trial, it may be of interest to find a\nsubgroup with a positive average treatment effect. However, existing methods\neither lack inferential guarantees, heavily restrict the search for the\nsubgroup, or sacrifice efficiency by naive data splitting. We propose a novel\nframework called chiseling that allows the analyst to interactively refine and\ntest a candidate subgroup by iteratively shrinking it.

Among these, Mamba has emerged as a\nleading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of\nlanguage modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly\ndeteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during\npre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.\nThrough detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the\nout-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within\nthe parameterization of the state transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$.

Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model\nto be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to\npropagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales\nlinearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard\ntransformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and\nbaselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than\nstandard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior\nnoise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by\naligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our\nadvantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually\nimproving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDELTAformer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08MTS\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u662fMTS\u4e2dTransformer\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5728Transformer\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e38\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e8c\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDELTAformer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u59d4\u6258\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u91cf\u3001\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u59d4\u6258\u4ee4\u724c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "DELTAformer\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u805a\u7126\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5229\u7528MTS\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6311\u6218\uff0cDELTAformer\u53ef\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically\nintroduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the\nimpact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and\ndiscretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant\ndecrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable\nsampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity\nsamplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler\nwith a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of\na high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved\nby optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling\ndynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time\nschedules that allocate steps non-uniformly.

To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular\nidentifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from\na subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees\non a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory\non computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for\nthe compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output\nfunctions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set\ndistribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure\nis unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set\ndistribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module\nidentification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of\nsynthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\u6240\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e00\u7c7b\u53d7\u57fa\u56e0\u7535\u8def\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8003\u8651\u7ec4\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5219\u4e0d\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7b80\u5316\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u7535\u8def\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Existing time series\nforecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation\nwhen conducting large-scale global station forecasting.

To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured\nAttention Block in this paper.

Given query-specific context significantly improves the\nusefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can\nbe used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner\ncreates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about\ndataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created\na prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the\nmetadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some\nfeatures that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that\nrepresent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading\nand parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and\ngrouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for\nthe LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this\nearly prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,\nfor which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses\ncontaining hallucinations.

In this paper, we use clinical\ncontext, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic\nevaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR\ndiagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a\n``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for\nexisting contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.\nUsing this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several\ndiagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether\nstrong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an\nability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that\nperformance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not\nexist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives\nfrom inferring this clinical context.

Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown\nadvanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we\nunderscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise\nknowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge\ncoherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across\nclients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt\nclass-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During\nprompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge\nconflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,\nintensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method\nthat explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt\ncommunication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism\n(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across\nclients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a\nclass-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate\ninter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant\nknowledge aggregation.

However, manual matching is labor-intensive\nand error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic\nreview of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases\nand one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial\nmatching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies\nfocused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only\n(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only\n(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real\npatient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics\nlimited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the\nGPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in\nmatching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising\nstrategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o\nmodel, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models\nfor data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital\ninfrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently\nlarge real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as\nreducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias.

In\nhigh-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate\nestimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to\nthe reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,\nheterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning\nframework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision\n(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct\ntask while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal\nvalidity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the\ntraining objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public\nspinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.\nposterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset\n(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.\nnon-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves\nthe highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive\nperformance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in\ntreatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\\epsilon_{\\text{NN-PEHE}}$\n(0.2778) and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs\nin AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,\nwith $\\epsilon_{\\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.\nBy providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a\npowerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient\noutcomes.

Extending\nOff-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,\nremains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy\nEvaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference\nevaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that\ncombines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference\nsignals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component\ninspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic\nalignment.

Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed\nIPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance.

Promising unprecedented speed and\nthe ability to learn from real-world data, it offers a real alternative to\nconventional deep learning (DL) models. However, no experimental evaluation on\nproduction-grade networks has yet validated its assumed scalability or\npractical benefits. This leaves mobile network operators (MNOs) and the\nresearch community without clear guidance on its applicability. In this paper,\nwe fill this gap by employing both differentiable ray tracing and DL models to\nemulate radio coverage using extensive real-world data collected from the\nnetwork of a major MNO, covering 13 cities and more than 10,000 antennas.

We introduce $\\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective\nreinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest\nmanagement, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,\ncarbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:\nsite-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning\nrobust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of\nmulti-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning\ndifficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw\n(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing\nminimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,\nstandard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive\ncurriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically\nselecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct\nmanagement philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive\nhigh-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies\nbalance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining\ncarbon gains.

While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven\nprogress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:\nhuman-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora\nare often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales\ninto prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we\npresent PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted\nheuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are\niteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that\nare both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts\nsupport two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve\nautonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled\ntraces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.\nIn self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new\nstate-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME\n24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on\nCodeforces.

Generative models have\nrecently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level\nwhile preserving utility.

In this\nwork, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic\ntabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we\npropose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to\nreduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is\nnon-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed\nfeature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data\ndistributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and\ndemonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,\nachieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as\nhigher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly\nefficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing.

Early-exit based self-speculative\ndecoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many\napproaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such\ndraft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and\nselected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the\nvast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft\ncost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To\nmitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD)\nthat fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is\nwasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the\nmodel layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and\nremaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and\nverification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its\nfinal layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a\nverify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly\nanalogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical\nresults confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in\nself-speculative LLM inference.

We present\nPi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a\ndata-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that\nencodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase\nsynchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction\nerror. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence\nterm that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them\nmeaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is\nlightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model\ncombines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch\nsignal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a\nsingle score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and\nPSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with\nparticular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies.

Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed\nmodels, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the\nupdated model to covered clients.

Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and\nthe high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches\nhave garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection\nremains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of\nreconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,\nignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus\nfailing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose\nStrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the\noptimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the\ntime series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture\nsuch structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape\nin the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent\nstructural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time\nseries.

Since only a subset of the\nclients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent\nto fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of\nresearchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL\nframeworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed\nfairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV\nenvironment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework\nto ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL\ntraining process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module\nwithin the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair\ncollaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.\nThe selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling\nthe clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier\ndetection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the\nmodel performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or\nloss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily\nsuspend such clients from participating in the FL training process.

We identify that the root\ncause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual\ndata points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss\nlandscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can\ndrastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks\nexploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate\nthe steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly\nrecovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical\nrobustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal.

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates\nin antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high\nbioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,\ncomputational models specifically designed to predict associations between\noligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a\nprompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover\npotential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,\nmicrobes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic\ninformation. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a\nprompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful\npaired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global\nfeatures. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a\nbenchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and\nhyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module.

In this work, we present a novel multi-stage\nreinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization\ncapabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong\nbaselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap\nwith state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u8bed\u97f3\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u9762\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u7684MLLMs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Solely\nrelying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to\nmodel the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the\nchannel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on\ndrive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In\nthis paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for\nLSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The\nframework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the\nissue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method\nbased on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via\ndistance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location\nextraction.

By examining the\ndistribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples\npredominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift\ntoward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the\nExponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular\nexponential term as the margin.

Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on\ncustomers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although\nregression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference\ntasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds,\nstrategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under\nthreshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending\ndistribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers\nstrategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those\nunaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach\nconsisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a\nsample around the threshold.

In contrast, most existing robotic navigation\npolicies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to\nreal-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural\nand complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic\nfoundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based\nnavigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)\nbackbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric\nimages, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a\nrandomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of\nusable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,\nsemantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves\nstrong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,\nand the ability to follow novel natural language instructions.

To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple\n\\textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack\nSuccess Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances\nclean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples\ninstead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the\nsample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited\nimprovements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit\nunsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a\nmere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional\ncollaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address\nthe above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple\ncombination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance\nboth evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks.\nTherefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both\nstealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically,\nComponent A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an\nappropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable\n``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples\nwith similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote\nstealthiness.

The development of advanced control\nstrategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of\nscalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the\nneed of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves\ncontrolling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents\ntend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy\nfor a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces\nacting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader\nwe introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to\nthe problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large\ngroups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a\nstraightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced\narchitectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation\nstrategy.

Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge\nto them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own\nconversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to\nthis failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental\nin the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a\nconversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I\nwill claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the\nestablishment of the connection we are after.

However, these methods remain constrained by the\nlimitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode\nphysical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex\nrule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely\nlimited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires\ncomputationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a\nreflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We\nfirst discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action\ncodebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for\nplanning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware\nreflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient\ncomputation.

In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability.

We\nidentify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of\nimplicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens\nto enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and\ncollapses.

Our deterministic alignment module enables robust\nmapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to\nexpose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing\ncategory-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model\nfailure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or\ndata augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study\nwith LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies\nhidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Z - Scores\u8de8\u5ea6\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5982E - Scores\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Z - Scores\u8de8\u5ea6\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u6620\u5c04\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4e0d\u6d41\u7545\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u6d41\u7545\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "Z - Scores\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u4e86INTJ\u548cPRN\u4e0d\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "Z - Scores\u53ef\u8ba9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While RAG\nhas shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual\nconsistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ\nfrom those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that\nLLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or\nadversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At\nthe same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack\nsurfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or\ncontent of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to\nmanipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal\nframework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we\naddress a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems.

We improve model\nrobustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure\ngeneralizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.\nEvaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,\nEnglish, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art\nresults. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,\nwith fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models\ndouble its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,\nthis lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding\noutputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and\nhigh-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation\nstudies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the\ncommunity to promote further research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGemma 3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578bEmbeddingGemma\uff0c\u7ecfMTEB\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u84b8\u998f\u4ece\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7528\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u786e\u4fdd\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "EmbeddingGemma (300M)\u5728MTEB\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e5\u4ebf\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e24\u500d\u5927\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u622a\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u4ecd\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "EmbeddingGemma\u6027\u80fd - \u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
