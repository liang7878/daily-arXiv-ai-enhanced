Existing methods typically serialize all columns\nin a table into pretrained language models to incorporate context, but this\ncoarse-grained approach often degrades performance in wide tables with many\nirrelevant or misleading columns. To address this, we propose a novel\nretrieve-and-verify context selection framework for accurate column annotation,\nintroducing two methods: REVEAL and REVEAL+. In REVEAL, we design an efficient\nunsupervised retrieval technique to select compact, informative column contexts\nby balancing semantic relevance and diversity, and develop context-aware\nencoding techniques with role embeddings and target-context pair training to\neffectively differentiate target and context columns. To further improve\nperformance, in REVEAL+, we design a verification model that refines the\nselected context by directly estimating its quality for specific annotation\ntasks. To achieve this, we formulate a novel column context verification\nproblem as a classification task and then develop the verification model.\nMoreover, in REVEAL+, we develop a top-down verification inference technique to\nensure efficiency by reducing the search space for high-quality context subsets\nfrom exponential to quadratic.

One challenge in defining incentive\ncompatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit\nreports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a\nrange of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion\nof Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that\nauctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their\ndefinition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome\nof an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome\nof any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both\nFirst-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC\ndefinition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints\nthat the advertiser can report.\n  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse\nAuto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding\nIncentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting\nis preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than\nthe least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport.

We\ndemonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that\nSPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to\nemploy uniform bidding.

Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium,\nwhere implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical\nimplementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains\nunderdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing\napproaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a\nnovel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0\nto 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness\nlevels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that\nultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted\nreturns.

This enables sellers to offer\npersonalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to\nnon-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies\nhas caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online\nsellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to\nbetter track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper\npresents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their\nsocial activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller\nshould strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in\nsocial networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller\nand users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this\ngame comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well\nas among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure\nconsistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under\nrandom user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying\nbackward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique\nperfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as\nthe accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the\nequilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and\nfacilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off\nafter the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data\naccess and profiling practices by potential sellers.

An effective solution is\nto approximate the limit-state function with a surrogate model iteratively\nrefined through active learning, thereby reducing the number of expensive\nsimulations. At each iteration, an acquisition strategy selects the next sample\nby balancing two competing goals: exploration, to reduce global predictive\nuncertainty, and exploitation, to improve accuracy near the failure boundary.\nClassical strategies, such as the U-function and the Expected Feasibility\nFunction (EFF), implicitly condense exploration and exploitation into a scalar\nscore derived from the surrogate predictive mean and variance, concealing the\ntrade-off and biasing sampling. We introduce a multi-objective optimization\n(MOO) formulation for sample acquisition in reliability analysis, where\nexploration and exploitation are explicit, competing objectives. Within our\nframework, U and EFF correspond to specific Pareto-optimal solutions, providing\na unifying perspective that connects classical and Pareto-based approaches.\nSolving the MOO problem discards dominated candidates, yielding a compact\nPareto set, with samples representing a quantifiable exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off.

However, relying on personal data presents challenges\nin adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's \"right to be forgotten\".\nMachine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the\nefficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without\ncompromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current\nbenchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec --\nfail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on\ncollaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket\nrecommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore\ncritical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design\ndesiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic\nbenchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering\nfeedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple\nrecommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and\nseveral unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS\nunlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that\nreflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests.\nWe also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation\nsetting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works\nfor sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning\nrequests.

Further,\nshadowAttn proposes insightful techniques such as NPU compute graph bucketing,\nhead-wise NPU-CPU/GPU pipeline and per-head fine-grained sparsity ratio to\nachieve high accuracy and efficiency. shadowAttn delivers the best performance\nwith highly limited CPU/GPU resource; it requires much less CPU/GPU resource to\ndeliver on-par performance of SoTA frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fashadowAttn\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650CPU/GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u56e0\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4f7f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u5b50\u4eceNPU\u56de\u9000\u5230CPU/GPU\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fashadowAttn\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0a\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9CPU/GPU\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7528NPU\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u9690\u85cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u8981\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51faNPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u5206\u6876\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "shadowAttn\u5728CPU/GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "shadowAttn\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf - \u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8fd0\u884cLLMs\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this\ndomain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a\nprescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper\ninvestigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a\nfleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as\nmobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to\nexecute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall\nmakespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid\nGenetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with\ntargeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer\nchromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required\nedges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving\ncrossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques\nto intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against\nestablished single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive\nperformance.

When multiple forecasting\nmethods are available, an alternative to method selection is forecast\ncombination. In this paper, we consider the combination of a large pool of VaR\nand ES forecasts. As there have been few studies in this area, we implement a\nvariety of new combining methods. In terms of simplistic methods, in addition\nto the simple average, the large pool of forecasts leads us to use the median\nand mode. As a complement to the previously proposed performance-based weighted\ncombinations, we use regularised estimation to limit the risk of overfitting\ndue to the large number of weights. By viewing the forecasts of VaR and ES from\neach method as the bounds of an interval forecast, we are able to apply\ninterval forecast combining methods from the decision analysis literature.\nThese include different forms of trimmed mean, and a probability averaging\nmethod that involves a mixture of the probability distributions inferred from\nthe VaR and ES forecasts. Among other methods, we consider smooth transition\nbetween two combining methods. Using six stock indices and a pool of 90\nindividual forecasting methods, we obtained particularly strong results for a\ntrimmed mean approach, the probability averaging method, and performance-based\nweighting combining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u91cfVaR\u548cES\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u516d\u4e2a\u80a1\u7968\u6307\u6570\u548c90\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u6709\u591a\u79cdVaR\u548cES\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u5747\u3001\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u3001\u4f17\u6570\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u533a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u516d\u4e2a\u80a1\u7968\u6307\u6570\u548c90\u79cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u5747\u503c\u6cd5\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ee9\u6548\u52a0\u6743\u7ec4\u5408\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u7279\u522b\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5927\u91cfVaR\u548cES\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We introduce several consistency-related axioms for RPRs\nand show that our method satisfies them, including those failed by a wide class\nof natural RPRs. While we prove that the algorithmic problem of maximizing\nconsistency is computationally hard, we provide a sampling-based implementation\nof our RPR that is efficient in practice. We run this implementation on known\nstatistical models and find that, when possible, our method selects the maximum\nlikelihood estimator of the data. Finally, we show that our RPR can be used in\nmany real-world settings to gain insights about how the rule currently being\nused can be modified or replaced to substantially improve the consistency of\nthe process.\n  Taken together, our work bridges an important gap between the axiomatic and\nstatistical approaches to rank aggregation, laying a robust theoretical and\ncomputational foundation for principled rule picking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff08RPRs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RPR\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u867d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u5b9e\u6392\u540d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u4f17\u591a\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RPR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RPR\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u6392\u540d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u5b9e\u6392\u540d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u805a\u5408\u516c\u7406\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u5960\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

It has long\nbeen known that the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm is\noptimal (i.e., $1$-competitive) when the job sizes are known up-front [Schrage,\n1968]. But in the non-clairvoyant setting where job sizes are revealed only\nwhen the job finishes, no algorithm can be constant-competitive [Motwani,\nPhillips, and Torng, 1994].\n  We consider the $\\varepsilon$-clairvoyant setting, where $\\varepsilon \\in\n[0,1]$, and each job's processing time becomes known once its remaining\nprocessing time equals an $\\varepsilon$ fraction of its processing time. This\ncaptures settings where the system user uses the initial $(1-\\varepsilon)$\nfraction of a job's processing time to learn its true length, which it can then\nreveal to the algorithm. The model was proposed by Yingchareonthawornchai and\nTorng (2017), and it smoothly interpolates between the clairvoyant setting\n(when $\\epsilon = 1$) and the non-clairvoyant setting (when $\\varepsilon = 0$).\nIn a concrete sense, we are asking: how much knowledge is required to\ncircumvent the hardness of this problem?\n  We show that a little knowledge is enough, and that a constant competitive\nalgorithm exists for every constant $\\varepsilon > 0$.

While recent advances in deep learning have\nsignificantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of\nexplainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust\nand transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on\nattention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack\nsystematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale\ndatasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate\nrationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding\nthrough two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations\nreflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how\nconsistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the\nevaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,\noffering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with\ncurrent clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of\nrationales of ICD coding.

Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the\nbest balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance\nheavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are\ndifficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users\noften prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal\nPG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies\nhave explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by\ninefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to\nconstruct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the\ndataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies\nbetween configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.\n  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for\nautomatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model\ntransfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query\nperformance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.\nIt also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration\nrecommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific\ndatasets and accuracy targets.

Extending sequence length generally\nimproves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is\ninfeasible due to latency and memory constraints.

This also\nenables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization:\nattention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook,\nwhich reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient\ncontext injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly\nintegrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel.\nAll context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached\nrepresentations remain query-independent.\n  Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show\nthat VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy\nwhile reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in\nbalancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVQL\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u957f\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u957f\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u635f\u8017\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVQL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u952e\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVQL\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "VQL\u5728\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Using nine different indices of socio-economic performance\n(domestic comprehensive wealth, income equality, research and development\nexpenditure, patent applications, human capital, corruption perception index,\nfreedom, planetary pressure-adjusted Human Development Index, healthy life\nexpectancy at birth), we find no evidence that they are. In fact, we find that\ncountries with low or negative population growth perform better on average for\nall indicators, and that even within-country time series show that most older\nand slower-growing populations fare better on average. These findings challenge\ncommon assumptions and highlight the need to move beyond fear-based and\npolitically motivated narratives toward a more informed understanding of what\ntruly supports thriving societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u6216\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u4e0e\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4f4e\u6216\u8d1f\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u56fd\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u6050\u60e7\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u4eec\u5e38\u62c5\u5fe7\u4eba\u53e3\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u75b2\u8f6f\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u62c5\u5fe7\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u7814\u7a76\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e5d\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8868\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6ca1\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u653e\u7f13\u6216\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u4e0e\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4f4e\u6216\u8d1f\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u56fd\u5bb6\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u56fd\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u8001\u9f84\u548c\u4f4e\u589e\u957f\u4eba\u53e3\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u6050\u60e7\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u652f\u6491\u793e\u4f1a\u7e41\u8363\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

For the case of $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{F}_2$, this is the\nwell-studied problem of refuting semirandom instances of $k$-XOR, where the\nworks of [GKM22,HKM23] establish a tight trade-off between runtime and clause\ndensity for refutation: for any choice of a parameter $\\ell$, they give an\n$n^{O(\\ell)}$-time algorithm to certify that there is no assignment that can\nsatisfy more than $\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon$-fraction of constraints in a\nsemirandom $k$-XOR instance, provided that the instance has $O(n) \\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{n}{\\ell}\\right)^{k/2 - 1} \\log n /\\varepsilon^4$ constraints, and\nthe work of [KMOW17] provides good evidence that this tight up to a\n$\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor via lower bounds for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy.\nHowever for larger fields, the only known results for this problem are\nestablished via black-box reductions to the case of $\\mathbb{F}_2$, resulting\nin an $|{\\mathbb{F}}|^{3k}$ gap between the current best upper and lower\nbounds.\n  In this paper, we give an algorithm for refuting semirandom\n$k$-LIN$(\\mathbb{F})$ instances with the \"correct\" dependence on the field size\n$|{\\mathbb{F}}|$.

Our results reveal\nstriking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment\nconsistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)\nranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely\nundermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To\ncharacterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human\nforecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in\nnew experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed\nby contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.\nall-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility\n(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a\nreward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to\ninfluence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For\nexample, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of\npunishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results\nrefocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it \"works\" to the\nspecific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our\nstudy demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine\nlearning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions\nbetween multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex\nsocial phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u60e9\u7f5a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u60e9\u7f5a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u805a\u7126\u60e9\u7f5a\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u60e9\u7f5a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6539\u53d814\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u6837360\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6536\u96c67100\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684147618\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u60e9\u7f5a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u60e9\u7f5a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u60e9\u7f5a\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e14\u591a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u60e9\u7f5a\u6548\u679c\u7684\u4e89\u8bba\u7126\u70b9\u4ece\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5411\u5177\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u89c4\u5f8b\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability\njudgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause\ndeviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian\nerror. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)\nprobing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted\nposterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in\nincreased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases\nerror, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly\ncorrelated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on\nground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to\nsycophancy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u8c04\u5a9a\u5bf9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u91cf\u5316LLMs\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u771f\u76f8\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a763\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90LLMs\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u51faLLMs\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "1.

Guided by a\nfine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM\npasses to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\\% (average\n+4.6\\% on RISC Zero, +1\\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains.\nOur work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM\nperformance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and\nsuperoptimizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9zkVM\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6LLVM\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u4f20\u7edfCPU\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u90e8\u5206LLVM\u901a\u9053\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709zkVM\u7ee7\u627f\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9zkVM\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u7591\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f3064\u4e2aLLVM\u901a\u9053\u30016\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u672a\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRISC - V\u7684zkVM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c58\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6LLVM\u4f18\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347zkVM\u6027\u80fd\u8d8540%\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCPU\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u90e8\u5206LLVM\u901a\u9053\uff0czkVM\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534745%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65f6\u95f4\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9zkVM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3azkVM\u7279\u5b9a\u901a\u9053\u3001\u540e\u7aef\u548c\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We then proceed to analyze\nhow evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design\nspace. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a\nbetter understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization\nalgorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.\nThis investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently\nfind near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies\nthat are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the\nalgorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the\nmorphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms\nregularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,\nas a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution.

At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are\ntightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and\ncomputation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy,\nand memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these\nissues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying\ncache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However,\nbecause existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer\nprefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory\npooling.\n  To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache\npool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests'\nquery tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for\nefficient pooling.

Recently, diffusion models have attracted\nsignificant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user\ninterest distributions.

First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the\ncondition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian\nnoise.

We add special weights\nfor each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM\nfine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention\nderived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking\nexperiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce\nchanges in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a\nmodel that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation\nshows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as\ncode translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation\nstudy that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to\nmimic human attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEyeMulator\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6709\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u60f3\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u6dfb\u52a0\u7279\u6b8a\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u81ea\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u773c\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "EyeMulator\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u8865\u5168\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EyeMulator\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u8ba9\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this study, we develop a new recurrent\ntransformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure\nand CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The\ngeomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),\nsurrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.\nThe faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The\nheterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by\nhierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,\nmean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell\nproperties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also\ntreated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)\n4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is\nmore accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains\naccuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is\nthen used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different\nmonitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed\ndata collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true\nmodels.

However, this standard design is neither\nincentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is\nnoise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker\ncompetitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes\nmisreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.\nAttempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that\nadd even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism\nand practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel\ndeterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of\nscoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts\nagainst the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy\noutcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in\ntypical settings.

Experimental results show our approach not only\nboosts immediate task performance but also significantly mitigates knowledge\ndegradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of\ncatastrophic forgetting in neural networks", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u6301\u4e45\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u5c55\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210Fisher\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b9\u5dee\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u5373\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A theoretical model is developed to capture the\ntriple-channel interactions among unorganized, organized and e-retailing in\nemerging markets, taking into account the essential features of the\npharmaceutical retail landscape, consumers, retailers and pharmaceutical\nproducts. Given the retailer and customer-specific factors, the price-setting\ngame between the triple-channel retailers yielded the optimal prices for these\nretailers. The analysis found that the product category level demand has no\ninfluence on optimal pricing strategies of the retailers. The analysis also\nreveals counterintuitive results, for instance, (i) an increase in customer\nacceptance of unorganized retailers will result in a decrease in profits of\nboth unorganized and organized retailers; (ii) as the distance and\ntransportation cost to unorganized retailers increases for the consumers, the\nprofit of the unorganized retailer increases; and (iii) consumers marginal\nutility of money has no influence on the optimal price, but have an influence\non the profit of the three retail channels.

PLMs can better capture token semantics than\ntraditional Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on statistical features\n(e.g., TF-IDF, bag of words). However, PLMs may still attend to less relevant\ntokens in a bug report, which can impact their effectiveness. In addition, the\nmodel can be sub-optimal with its recommendations when the interaction history\nof developers around similar bugs is not taken into account. We designed\nTriagerX to address these limitations. First, to assess token semantics more\nreliably, we leverage a dual-transformer architecture. Unlike current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines that employ a single transformer\narchitecture, TriagerX collects recommendations from two transformers with each\noffering recommendations via its last three layers. This setup generates a\nrobust content-based ranking of candidate developers. TriagerX then refines\nthis ranking by employing a novel interaction-based ranking methodology, which\nconsiders developers' historical interactions with similar fixed bugs. Across\nfive datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including\nSOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation\naccuracy by over 10%. We worked with our large industry partner to successfully\ndeploy TriagerX in their development environment. The partner required both\ndeveloper and component recommendations, with components acting as proxies for\nteam assignments-particularly useful in cases of developer turnover or team\nchanges.

To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy.

The technical report for the paper titled \"Effective\n  Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs\" in SIGMOD 2026", "summary": "Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling\ndiverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade\nextensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations.

Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil\nreporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the\nprofile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units\n(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications\nwhile in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop\ncomplications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of\ndengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive\nstatistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to\nidentify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine\nlearning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.\nVisualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047\nadmissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including\nnon-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor\n(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103).

We described a large cohort of dengue patients\nadmitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue\ncomplications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of\nleukocytes and lower level of platelets.

Please refer to source code\n  available at: https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor", "summary": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

However, software engineering is\nmuch more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a\nprompt.\n  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing,\nand program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture\nexploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the\ncode level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be\ntaken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This\ncreates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen\nas a member of a development team.\n  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based\nsoftware workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software\nengineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.\nSpecification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of\nmany software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A\nsuccessful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would\ninvolve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.\n  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes\nmore automated.

To make sure that the data replicas are\nup-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the\nreplicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of\nwaiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the\nsystem. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of\nreplicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the\nreplicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be\nimplemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility\nis to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge\nto the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients\ncan get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.\n  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the\noperations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects\ncan be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency. Second, even if\nsome operations eventually stabilize in their effects, a particular client may\nstill experience starvation if, from some point onward, each of its operations\nis later revoked. In this paper, we address these challenges through a general\nDAG-based framework for replicated data types, where replicas exchange their\nlocal views and merge them using a reconciliation function. Within this\nframework, we design reconciliation functions that implement a wait-free\neventually consistent replicated state machine ensuring both stable convergence\nand fair progress. Specifically, every replica maintains a growing sequence of\nclient operations, and we guarantee that: (1) all replicas share a common,\nmonotonically growing stable prefix of operations, and (2) no client starves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDAG\u7684\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85\u6570\u636e\u590d\u5236\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85\u6700\u7ec8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u590d\u5236\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85\u6570\u636e\u590d\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u64a4\u9500\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9965\u997f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDAG\u7684\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8ba9\u526f\u672c\u4ea4\u6362\u672c\u5730\u89c6\u56fe\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85\u6700\u7ec8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u590d\u5236\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u526f\u672c\u6709\u5171\u540c\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u65e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9965\u997f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eDAG\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7b49\u5f85\u6570\u636e\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the\nedge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and\nentropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and\ntime-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5206\u6790NMS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdapSNE\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u964d\u4f4e\u8fb9\u7f18\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caNMS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdapSNE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210Fireworks Algorithm\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u548c\u65f6\u5206\u590d\u7528\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002", "result": "AdapSNE\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "AdapSNE\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

A secondary network maps synchronized\nlow-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling\nreconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once\ntrained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure\ninputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the\n$p$C-$\\beta$-VAE decoder.

In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in\n$O((\\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement\nover the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or\nunpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that\nparallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful.

By rescaling weights while preserving model\noutputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.\nExperiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality\n(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in\nLLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning\ntasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation\ntasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple\narchitectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWISCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316Transformer\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWISCA\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "WISCA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.6%\uff0c\u591a\u67b6\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e2.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "WISCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728GQA\u67b6\u6784\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\u3002"}}

However, while explainable approaches can help\nunderstand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the\nunderlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many\npractitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency\nwith a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers\nactionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.\nCounterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by\nshowing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We\npropose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a\nnovel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual\nmethods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model\nusing an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used\nto generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original\nunderlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding\nthe ``effort\" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to\ncausal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides\na more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a\nfavourable outcome.

Artificial Intelligence systems are mainly\nimplemented as software solutions, and it is essential to discover and remove\nsoftware defects to assure its quality using defect analysis which is one of\nthe major activities that contribute to software quality. Despite the\nproliferation of AI-based systems, current defect analysis models fail to\ncapture their unique attributes. This paper proposes a framework inspired by\nthe Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) paradigm and enables defect analysis\nof Artificial Intelligence systems while recognizing its special attributes and\ncharacteristics. This study demonstrated the feasibility of modifying ODC for\nAI systems to classify its defects. The ODC was adjusted to accommodate the\nData, Learning, and Thinking aspects of AI systems which are newly introduced\nclassification dimensions. This adjustment involved the introduction of an\nadditional attribute to the ODC attributes, the incorporation of a new severity\nlevel, and the substitution of impact areas with characteristics pertinent to\nAI systems. The framework was showcased by applying it to a publicly available\nMachine Learning bug dataset, with results analyzed through one-way and two-way\nanalysis.

This bi-directional learning is achieved\nusing an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse\nsimilarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.\nTo ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the\nsparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.\nExperiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not\nonly outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance\ncomparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the\nbenefits of sparse models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a20\u5bc6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u53cc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u7684LSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4ece\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a20\u5bc6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u53cc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u6559\u5e08\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7a20\u5bc6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728MSCOCO\u548cFlickr30k\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4f7f\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

(11 pages, 3 figures)", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to\ntheir immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

A\ncore requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and\nmaintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To\nthis end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct\nreal-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived\nfrom high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)\nspecialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor\ndata from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT\nengineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines\noften train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,\ntask- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required\nto design DTs.\n  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable\nthe systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes\nand DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow\nparadigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models.\nIt also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML\nalgorithms tailored for DT design.

This study investigates developers' engagement with\nvariable versus mandatory code, the concentration of variable code workload,\nand the effectiveness of expertise metrics in CSS projects. We mined\nrepositories of 25 CSS projects, analyzing 450,255 commits from 9,678\ndevelopers. Results show that 59% of developers never modified variable code,\nwhile about 17% were responsible for developing and maintaining 83% of it. This\nindicates a high concentration of variable code expertise among a few\ndevelopers, suggesting that task assignments should prioritize these\nspecialists. Moreover, conventional expertise metrics performed\npoorly--achieving only around 55% precision and 50% recall in identifying\ndevelopers engaged with variable code.

To address this gap, we introduce\nMeta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit\nmetacognitive capabilities.

Experiments on three\nchallenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that\nMeta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to\n27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and\nimproving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;\nand (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and\nmodel backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeta - R1\u6846\u67b6\u8d4b\u4e88\u5176\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u3001\u7701token\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u548c\u5143\u7ea7\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u7ea7\u8054\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u516b\u4e2a\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMeta - R1\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd527.3%\uff1b\u7701token\uff0ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u81f315.7% - 32.7%\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534714.8%\uff1b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta - R1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7701token\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002"}}

This property, commonly\nreferred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In\nregression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have\nemerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,\nassumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results\nacross studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using\nonly a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements\ngeneralize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we\nsystematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the\nliterature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling\nmethods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with\nreal-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that\ncalibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results.

We provide a\nunifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily\nand bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN\nrepresentations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent\nparameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity\nto class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation\nof classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low\nhigher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural\nbottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph\nensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking\ninto underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and\noversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with\nclosed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising\nhigher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and\ntwo-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based\nrewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across\nall homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on\nreal-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs\ntypically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the\nliterature.

Current methods, relying on symbolic\nregression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual\nphenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to\nphysicists. This \"sensory deprivation\" severely weakens their ability to\ninterpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To\naddress this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual\nInduction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic\nformulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic\nreasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via\na curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning\nto interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a\nCausal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration\n(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During\ninference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a\nhigh-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic\nregression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final\nstep, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the\ntheoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce\nPhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that\nVIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy\nand interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

Using\nreinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively\nimproved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains\nacross reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on\nMATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and\nLlama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold\nlarger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts\nthat stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution\nfor efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdWeak - to - Strong Transfer (WST)\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5c0f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\uff08MATH - 500\u3001GSM8K\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08HH - RLHF\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982MATH - 500\u63d0\u534798%\uff0cHH - RLHF\u63d0\u5347134%\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7GPT - 4o - mini\u548cLlama - 70B\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u652f\u6491\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5f3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0cWST\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited,\ndespite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions\nand being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust\nframeworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure,\nassuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This\npaper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model\ndesigned for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled\nenvironments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a\nsix-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through\ncontrols including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection,\nsecure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring,\nand live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory\nand security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap\nand maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across\nvarying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and\nstandards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond\npre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust\nprinciples. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and\nprovides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance\ncompliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges.

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another\nkernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable\nevaluation of generative image models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9002\u5f53\u5206\u6570\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u679c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u679c\u96be\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6cdb\u51fdBregman\u6563\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u9002\u5f53\u5206\u6570\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u822c\u504f\u5dee - \u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u5206\u6570\uff08\u6838\u5206\u6570\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63a8\u5e7f\u6821\u51c6 - \u9510\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5f53\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u6838\u7403\u9762\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9002\u5f53\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as\ncircuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation\nfor circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA\ndesigns. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA\ncircuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric\nfeatures. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of\neven higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial\nmodule-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance\nbottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design\nby leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels\nduring heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on\nEDA-related circuit graph datasets.

TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news\nsentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,\ntrading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all\nsignals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.\nSpecifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,\nstyle, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for\nsimilar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management\nmodel to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

In Ultimate, the player holding the disc\ncannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'\nmovements.

In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for\nmovement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was\nrecorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which\nwill be published as UltimateTrack dataset.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to\nsimulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain\nalignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale\nsimulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using\nsuch high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.\nExtensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the\nalignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of\nfine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when\ninteracting with RSs.

While AI models have shown promise in this\ndomain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the\ninterpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the\ncomplexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with\nPopulation Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer\nfor Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs\npopulation coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to\ndynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under\nfairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory\nFramework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system\nincorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based\nattribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated\non the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\\%$\nrecall at a strict $5\\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming\nstate-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\\%$\npredictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability\nmodule further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,\nvalidating interpretability.

However, the factors that drive this\nbrain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,\ntraining and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like\nrepresentations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers\n(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales.

In this paper, we investigate\nreflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We\npropose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how\ninstructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic\nreflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between\nthese reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing\ninstructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be\ndirectly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)\nsuppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it.

Additionally, the\nverification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling\nmore flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation\nquality.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nTabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for\nunivariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like\nRealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow\nconsists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical\nfeature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature\nextraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and\ntractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic\nregression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%\nimprovement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model\n(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the\nstrongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the\npractical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction\ntask under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we\nintroduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that\nTabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTabResFlow\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u683c\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u624b\u8f66\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TabResFlow\uff0c\u542bMLP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5168\u8fde\u63a5ResNet\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6837\u6761\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f3c\u7136\u5f97\u5206\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4TreeFlow\u63d0\u53479.64%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4NodeFlow\u5feb5.6\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u624b\u8f66\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "TabResFlow\u5728\u8868\u683c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, their\npredictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their\nadoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new\nuncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines\ngraph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our\nmethod is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a\nprobabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is\nconditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation\nmatrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the\nrationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient\nmodel training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the\nwell known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect\nOOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,\nthis setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD\npredictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under\nattacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method\nthat distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss\nlandscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting\nthe latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce\na {\\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the\nrugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced\ngeometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,\nbenefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks.

This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage\ntraining pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize\nthe model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize\nfor both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker\nsignificantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a\nvariety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method\nprovides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and\ncontrollable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for\ndeployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdBudgetThinker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d2\u5165\u7279\u6b8a\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u544a\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5269\u4f59\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u719f\u6089\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u9075\u5b88\u3002", "result": "BudgetThinker\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

A\npandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was\nnot prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people\nworldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the\nrespiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia.

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance.

Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are\noptimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to\nlearning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing\ncomplex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive\nscenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning\nacross domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,\nexperiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature\nand structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.\nThe modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing\narchitectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edcQGAT\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u878d\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQGAT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u7f16\u7801\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7ecf\u5178\u6295\u5f71\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eQGAT\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "QGAT\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u878d\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising\nstrategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce\nRoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables\nfine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic\nattributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first\nmodel to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,\nfacilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic\ndataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to\nevaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification\nmodels. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data\nnaively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data\nfor supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through\nextensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,\nwe demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model\nperformance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness\nacross demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a\n6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,\ncompared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic\ndata.

Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic\ninstructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were\nevaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to\ndistinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics\nincluded BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced\nprompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively\ndistinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity\ncompared to naive prompts.

However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones.

To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical\nframework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in\nlarge-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of\nscaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The\nmutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's\naggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)\nMitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the\nimpact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved\nConvergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the\nconvergence rate.

Diffusion models have been widely\nadopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal\naction distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps\nat inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their\npracticality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In\nthis work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive\nalter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion\naction decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling\nthrough an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time.

In this paper,\nwe introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework\nthat performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an\ninitial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures\n(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control\nnodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable\nposition, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to\nlocal deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation\nthen blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich\nnodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing\ninterpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while\npreserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient\nregions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal\nin textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term\nloss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.\nExperiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration\nerror from 6.2\\,px to ~2.4\\,px and increases the AUC at 25\\,px from 0.770 to\n0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning\nnetworks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple\nsubgraphs.

In this paper,\nwe present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge\nwithout depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses\nconstrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a\nKnowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a\nprefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external\nknowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows\nonly sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal\non Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800\nmillion facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.\nThese gains come with minimal generation-time overhead.

Given a time-varying sequence of persistence\ndiagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar\nfields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at \"inverting\"\nthe non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the\ncorresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which\nlearns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based\non the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the\nnon-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific\ntopological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical\nand topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,\ngiven an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach\ninstantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input\nthrough the network.

However, GNSS are highly vulnerable\nto spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead\nreceivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected\nnavigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most\nexisting spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques\nand struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this\nlimitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid\nQuantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS\nsignals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted\nduring the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT\nsolutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS\nreceivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,\nwhere attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time\ncomputations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen\ntime-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and\nsophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently\noutperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based\nmodels, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,\nunseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy\nof 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs\nbut is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an\naccuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%.

The framework\nsimultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather\nclassification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,\nachieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three\nspecialized datasets aligned with these tasks.

This principled approach ensures a holistic preference\nsignal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we\nobserve consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse\ngenerative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models\n(MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both\nobjective and subjective evaluations.

It not only helps students learn about realistic trial\nprocedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment\nprediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public\nbecause they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately,\nthe rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for\ncreating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising,\nexisting research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the\nsystematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more\nimportant for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To\nthis end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based\non the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework\nreplicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom\nroles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate\ntrial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents\nequipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities.

Federated learning (FL) offers a\nprivacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without\ncentralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems\nfaces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to\nnon-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by\nfrequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we\npropose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning\nframework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.\nFirst, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by\nminimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively\nmitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence\nstability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted\nAggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into\nthe aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model\nwhile significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse\nActivation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during\nthe aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from\nthe update process.

We use a\ncomprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions\nof Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized\nidentities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL\nproduces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which\nindicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and\nperpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized\nidentities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones\nwhen compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face\ndatasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to\nhuman perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount\nof variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts\nmost (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized\nidentities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and\nethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities,\nreinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and\nsocially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest\nand most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other\nmodels examined in this study, these findings have implications for the\ndynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and\nchallenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized\nidentities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Stable Diffusion\u4e09\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u80a4\u8272\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0cSD XL\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6709\u80a4\u8272\u504f\u89c1\u653e\u5927\u7b49\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08T2Is\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5ef6\u7eed\u793e\u4f1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u6216\u80a4\u8272\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752893\u79cd\u53d7\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5bf9Stable Diffusion\u4e09\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff08v1.5\u3001v2.1\u548cXL\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "SD XL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u80a4\u8272\u66f4\u6697\u3001\u66f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ea2\u8272\uff0c\u80a4\u8272\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9T2Is\u4e2d\u504f\u89c1\u653e\u5927\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired\nbehaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective\nand cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs\nduring the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors\nand avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically\nindiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to\ndetermine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the\nintervention strength.

Following the standard\ntwo-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature\nextraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the\nentire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first\nbenchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and\nthen adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network\nbackbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but\nstrong recognition performance.

In this\nwork, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video\nunderstanding through reasoning, perception coordination.

To\ncarry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new\nconfiguration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules,\n(2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3)\ndeploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts\nfor these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone,\nand impractical to scale.\n  We propose Xumi to tackle this problem.

Our approach not only reduces the\nprefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance\ncomparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.\nWithout additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a\nsingle $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\\approx\n180\\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\\approx 79.8$ with model\nLlama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faILRe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u7ba1\u9053\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u77ed\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe)\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e2d\u95f4\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\uff0c\u6d41\u5f0f\u5206\u5757\u9884\u586b\u5145\u7f16\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6309\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u53ec\u56de\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6c60\u5316\u5185\u6838\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u9884\u586b\u5145\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece $O(L^2)$ \u964d\u81f3 $O(L)$\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5904\u7406 $1M$ \u4ee4\u724c\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5728RULER - $1M$ \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d6\u5f97\u7ea679.8\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "ILRe\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for\ndeveloping adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber\nthreats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGANGRL - LLM\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GAN\u548cLLM\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548cSQLi\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08IDS\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u6807\u8bb0\u6076\u610f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GANGRL - LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GAN\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6709\u9650\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0cLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5229\u7528\u5224\u522b\u5668\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u5316\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We employ both probabilistic\nand generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models\nvarying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that\nquantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity\nand does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase\nstereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive\ncompression.

Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,\nuncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one\nof the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step.

We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the\nconventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully\nconnected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately\nprocess measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are\nensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a\nclassical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to\nadapt coherently.

To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework\nnamed SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation\npolicies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid\ndangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design\ndiverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation\npatterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and\nobjects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of\ndiffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)\nto schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding\npairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically\ngenerated in the entire bimanual manipulation process.

We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as\ndifferentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval.

The second chapter then\nfirst deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert\nspaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of\nconvergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the\nquestion of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly\nfocus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional\nspaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which\nallow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach.

In contrast, coarse\nannotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.\nIn this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)\nand negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to\ntrain a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We\npresent a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from\npurely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the\ntwo CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training\nannotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages\nestimating negative label distribution.
