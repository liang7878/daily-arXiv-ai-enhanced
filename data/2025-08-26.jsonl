Existing methods typically serialize all columns\nin a table into pretrained language models to incorporate context, but this\ncoarse-grained approach often degrades performance in wide tables with many\nirrelevant or misleading columns. To address this, we propose a novel\nretrieve-and-verify context selection framework for accurate column annotation,\nintroducing two methods: REVEAL and REVEAL+. In REVEAL, we design an efficient\nunsupervised retrieval technique to select compact, informative column contexts\nby balancing semantic relevance and diversity, and develop context-aware\nencoding techniques with role embeddings and target-context pair training to\neffectively differentiate target and context columns. To further improve\nperformance, in REVEAL+, we design a verification model that refines the\nselected context by directly estimating its quality for specific annotation\ntasks. To achieve this, we formulate a novel column context verification\nproblem as a classification task and then develop the verification model.\nMoreover, in REVEAL+, we develop a top-down verification inference technique to\nensure efficiency by reducing the search space for high-quality context subsets\nfrom exponential to quadratic. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art\nbaselines."}

One challenge in defining incentive\ncompatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit\nreports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a\nrange of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion\nof Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that\nauctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their\ndefinition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome\nof an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome\nof any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both\nFirst-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC\ndefinition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints\nthat the advertiser can report.\n  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse\nAuto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding\nIncentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting\nis preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than\nthe least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This\ndistinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for\nadvertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that\nSPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to\nemploy uniform bidding. These findings provide new insights into the incentive\nproperties of SPA in auto-bidding environments, particularly when considering\nadvertisers' perspectives on equilibrium selection."}

The first has the option to provide bid-ask\nquotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes,\nrefuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a\nmodel-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the\ncontinuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of\nadversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide\nbid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of\nwell-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to\n99.9$\\%$ in some cases."}

This enables sellers to offer\npersonalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to\nnon-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies\nhas caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online\nsellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to\nbetter track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper\npresents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their\nsocial activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller\nshould strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in\nsocial networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller\nand users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this\ngame comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well\nas among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure\nconsistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under\nrandom user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying\nbackward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique\nperfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as\nthe accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the\nequilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and\nfacilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off\nafter the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data\naccess and profiling practices by potential sellers.

An effective solution is\nto approximate the limit-state function with a surrogate model iteratively\nrefined through active learning, thereby reducing the number of expensive\nsimulations. At each iteration, an acquisition strategy selects the next sample\nby balancing two competing goals: exploration, to reduce global predictive\nuncertainty, and exploitation, to improve accuracy near the failure boundary.\nClassical strategies, such as the U-function and the Expected Feasibility\nFunction (EFF), implicitly condense exploration and exploitation into a scalar\nscore derived from the surrogate predictive mean and variance, concealing the\ntrade-off and biasing sampling. We introduce a multi-objective optimization\n(MOO) formulation for sample acquisition in reliability analysis, where\nexploration and exploitation are explicit, competing objectives.

Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium,\nwhere implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical\nimplementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains\nunderdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing\napproaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a\nnovel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0\nto 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness\nlevels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that\nultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted\nreturns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with\nrobust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as\nthose seen in 2024.

Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the\nbest balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance\nheavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are\ndifficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users\noften prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal\nPG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies\nhave explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by\ninefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to\nconstruct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the\ndataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies\nbetween configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.\n  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for\nautomatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model\ntransfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query\nperformance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.\nIt also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration\nrecommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific\ndatasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates\nout-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in\ndynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across\ndifferent datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to\n14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios.

We focus on two desiderata: the eventual stability of\nthe process and its expected social welfare. Following an impossibility result,\nwe describe several aggregation methods and report on agent-based simulations\nthat utilize natural language processing (NLP) and large-language models (LLMs)\nto model agents and their contexts. Using these simulations, we demonstrate\npromising results regarding the possibility of rapid convergence to a high\nsocial welfare collaborative text."}

For the case of $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{F}_2$, this is the\nwell-studied problem of refuting semirandom instances of $k$-XOR, where the\nworks of [GKM22,HKM23] establish a tight trade-off between runtime and clause\ndensity for refutation: for any choice of a parameter $\\ell$, they give an\n$n^{O(\\ell)}$-time algorithm to certify that there is no assignment that can\nsatisfy more than $\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon$-fraction of constraints in a\nsemirandom $k$-XOR instance, provided that the instance has $O(n) \\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{n}{\\ell}\\right)^{k/2 - 1} \\log n /\\varepsilon^4$ constraints, and\nthe work of [KMOW17] provides good evidence that this tight up to a\n$\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor via lower bounds for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy.\nHowever for larger fields, the only known results for this problem are\nestablished via black-box reductions to the case of $\\mathbb{F}_2$, resulting\nin an $|{\\mathbb{F}}|^{3k}$ gap between the current best upper and lower\nbounds.\n  In this paper, we give an algorithm for refuting semirandom\n$k$-LIN$(\\mathbb{F})$ instances with the \"correct\" dependence on the field size\n$|{\\mathbb{F}}|$. For any choice of a parameter $\\ell$, our algorithm runs in\n$(|{\\mathbb{F}}|n)^{O(\\ell)}$-time and strongly refutes semirandom\n$k$-LIN$(\\mathbb{F})$ instances with at least $O(n) \\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{|{\\mathbb{F}^*}| n}{\\ell}\\right)^{k/2 - 1} \\log(n |{\\mathbb{F}^*}|)\n/\\varepsilon^4$ constraints.

These\npipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency\nand raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model\nidentification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model\noutputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that\nuses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First\n(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an\nincoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow\n(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)\nstagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a\nstagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each\nstage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow\nwith clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on\nspecialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream\ntasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying\ndeployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,\nour single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.\n  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach\nshows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data\nscientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection\n(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead."}

By\nintroducing synthetic users with clear preferences for either popular or\nunpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals based on their\nactivation patterns. We then adjust the activations of the most biased neurons\nto steer recommendations toward fairer exposure.

This\npaper introduces a scalable framework for prioritising STPA-derived\nrequirements. The framework integrates outputs from each STPA step and\nincorporates expert evaluations based on four key factors: implementation time,\ncost, requirement type, and regulatory coverage. To reduce subjectivity,\nMonte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) is employed to calculate and stabilise requirement\nrankings. An automation toolchain supports the framework, enabling dynamic\nmapping of prioritised requirements in a scaling matrix. This visualisation\naids decision-making and ensures traceability across development phases. The\nframework is applicable from early conceptualisation to more advanced stages,\nenhancing its utility in iterative system development. The framework was\nvalidated through a real-world case study focused on Electric Vertical Take-off\nand Landing (eVTOL) operations, conducted in collaboration with the UK Civil\nAviation Authority.

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy.

As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training\nexamples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a\nprocess called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input\ntoken salience to output token examples during training. Human software\ndevelopers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more\nsalient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of\nphilosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since\npeople tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present\nEyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention\nwhile training for various software development tasks. We add special weights\nfor each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM\nfine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention\nderived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking\nexperiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce\nchanges in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a\nmodel that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation\nshows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as\ncode translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation\nstudy that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to\nmimic human attention."}

In this study, we develop a new recurrent\ntransformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure\nand CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The\ngeomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),\nsurrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.\nThe faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The\nheterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by\nhierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,\nmean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell\nproperties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also\ntreated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)\n4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is\nmore accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains\naccuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is\nthen used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different\nmonitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed\ndata collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true\nmodels. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction\nachieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D\nsaturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring\npressure and saturation in all three aquifers."}

However, this standard design is neither\nincentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is\nnoise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker\ncompetitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes\nmisreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.\nAttempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that\nadd even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism\nand practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel\ndeterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of\nscoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts\nagainst the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy\noutcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in\ntypical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging\nto analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to\njustify the mechanism.

Across\nfive datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including\nSOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation\naccuracy by over 10%. We worked with our large industry partner to successfully\ndeploy TriagerX in their development environment.

To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy.

Our\napproach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise\npolynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational\nalgebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that\nexhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the\nalgebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical\nzero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical\noptimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as\ncurves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods\nare computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a\nproof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal\nperceptrons with a few hidden units."}

The technical report for the paper titled \"Effective\n  Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs\" in SIGMOD 2026", "summary": "Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling\ndiverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade\nextensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions\ninclude (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node\nfeature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with\ncarefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without\nexplicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend\nDEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive\nexperiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit\nthat DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured\nagainst ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster."}

Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative\nsettings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters\nthat characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and\ncollecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal\nstriking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment\nconsistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)\nranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely\nundermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To\ncharacterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human\nforecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in\nnew experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed\nby contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.\nall-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility\n(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a\nreward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to\ninfluence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For\nexample, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of\npunishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results\nrefocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it \"works\" to the\nspecific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our\nstudy demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine\nlearning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions\nbetween multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex\nsocial phenomena."}

Methods. We performed a prospective study of\ndengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive\nstatistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to\nidentify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine\nlearning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.\nVisualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX.

To make sure that the data replicas are\nup-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the\nreplicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of\nwaiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the\nsystem. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of\nreplicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the\nreplicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be\nimplemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility\nis to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge\nto the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients\ncan get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.\n  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the\noperations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects\ncan be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency. Second, even if\nsome operations eventually stabilize in their effects, a particular client may\nstill experience starvation if, from some point onward, each of its operations\nis later revoked. In this paper, we address these challenges through a general\nDAG-based framework for replicated data types, where replicas exchange their\nlocal views and merge them using a reconciliation function. Within this\nframework, we design reconciliation functions that implement a wait-free\neventually consistent replicated state machine ensuring both stable convergence\nand fair progress. Specifically, every replica maintains a growing sequence of\nclient operations, and we guarantee that: (1) all replicas share a common,\nmonotonically growing stable prefix of operations, and (2) no client starves."}

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach.

Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by\nsetting specific activation functions within the \"2-2-2-1\" and \"3-2-2-1\" NNs\nmodels. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we\nderive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are\nexpressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and\nrational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and\ndensity plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the\nobtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for\naddressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering\nfields."}

However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited,\ndespite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions\nand being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust\nframeworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure,\nassuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This\npaper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model\ndesigned for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled\nenvironments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a\nsix-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through\ncontrols including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection,\nsecure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring,\nand live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory\nand security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap\nand maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across\nvarying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and\nstandards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond\npre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust\nprinciples. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and\nprovides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance\ncompliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges. Future research\nmay include empirical validation of the framework and cross-sector application\ntesting."}

Gruber"], "title": "A Novel Framework for Uncertainty Quantification via Proper Scores for Classification and Beyond", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "comment": "PhD Thesis (cumulative, spanning 6 peer-reviewed publications)", "summary": "In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty\nquantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.\nUncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and\nreliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another\nkernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable\nevaluation of generative image models."}

Reward\nhacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to\noverwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study\nthe behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand\nexamples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as\nwriting poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to\ntrain models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on\nthese tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new\nsettings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward\nfunctions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the\ntraining data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of\nmisalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,\nencouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to\nsimulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain\nalignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale\nsimulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using\nsuch high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.\nExtensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the\nalignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of\nfine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when\ninteracting with RSs.

We refer to this attack as\na Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).\n  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects\nFPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,\nbut also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and\nuniversal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs\nremain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via\nrobust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and\ndiscuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of\ncode-oriented LLMs."}

Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

Leveraging on this, we\npropose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via\nthe following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance\nregularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance\non the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,\nwhich ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the\ncovariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected\nattribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain\nsubject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal\nprediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world\nheterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain\ndifferent modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our\nfindings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with\nminimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on\nthe performance-fairness Pareto frontier."}

However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced\ndistortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global\nparameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical\nframework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in\nlarge-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of\nscaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The\nmutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's\naggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)\nMitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the\nimpact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved\nConvergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the\nconvergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a\nviable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of\nclients.

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration.

In\nthis work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive\nalter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion\naction decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling\nthrough an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We\nintegrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO\nbenchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its\ndiffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving\nsubstantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a\npromising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without\ncompromising performance."}

To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation\n(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing\ngeneration efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely\nexisting parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable\nconditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert\n(CoMoE) module.

By enabling independent modeling of foreground features\nunder different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement\nand redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge\nthe information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose\nWeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective\ninteraction between global text-level control from the backbone and\nfine-grained control from conditional branches.

A useful benchmark should be both\ndifficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also\nreflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism\ntension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with\nlimited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often\nskew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically\ndifferent paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a\nstatic benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models\nasynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community\nverification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions\nsourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi\nand history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and\nbrowsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are\noften hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them\nyields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset\nand its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human\nreview to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)\nUQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the\ngenerator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate\nsolutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts\ncollectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation\non only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already\nidentified correct answers among those that passed.

We vary 14 parameters\nthat characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and\ncollecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal\nstriking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment\nconsistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)\nranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely\nundermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To\ncharacterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human\nforecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in\nnew experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed\nby contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.\nall-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility\n(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a\nreward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to\ninfluence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For\nexample, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of\npunishment depends on whether groups can communicate.

Existing methods typically\nindiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to\ndetermine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the\nintervention strength.

Therefore, mitigating\noverthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,\ndefined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP).

We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the\nconventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully\nconnected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately\nprocess measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are\nensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a\nclassical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to\nadapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on\nMNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing\ndiscarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid\nquantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification."}

Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil\nreporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the\nprofile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units\n(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications\nwhile in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop\ncomplications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of\ndengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive\nstatistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to\nidentify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine\nlearning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.\nVisualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047\nadmissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including\nnon-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor\n(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR:\n3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver\ncirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR:\n2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03)\nwere significant risk factors for complications.

We described a large cohort of dengue patients\nadmitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue\ncomplications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of\nleukocytes and lower level of platelets.
