Classical methods for computing Nash equilibria, especially in linear quadratic settings, rely on strong structural assumptions and become impractical for nonlinear dynamics, many players, or long horizons, where multiple local equilibria may exist. We show through examples that such methods can fail to reach the true global Nash equilibrium even in relatively small games. To address this, we propose two population based evolutionary algorithms for general dynamic games with linear or nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary objective functions: a co evolutionary genetic algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization scheme. Both approaches search directly over joint strategy spaces without restrictive assumptions and are less prone to getting trapped in local Nash equilibria, providing more reliable approximations to global Nash solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u6216\u957f\u5468\u671f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e0d\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5c40\u7eb3\u4ec0\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper addresses two critical gaps in evolutionary game theory research: (1) the absence of realistic environmental stressors during strategy evolution, and (2) the Interpretability Gap, where evolved genetic strategies remain opaque binary sequences devoid of semantic meaning. We introduce a novel framework combining stochastic environmental perturbations (God Mode) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based behavioral profiling to transform evolved genotypes into interpretable character archetypes. Our experiments demonstrate that strategies evolved under chaotic conditions exhibit superior resilience and present distinct behavioral phenotypes, ranging from Ruthless Capitalists to Diplomatic Enforcers.

We solve each module and the quotient graph independently, with the latter being the core problem. This reduces the problem to solving on a prime graph, in which all modules are trivial. We then use a characterization of Chudnovsky et al. stating that any large enough prime graph has one of seven structures as an induced subgraph. These all have many $P_4$s, with the quantity growing linearly with the graph size, and we show that these allow a recursive branch tree algorithm to achieve running time $O^*((2 + \u03b5)^k)$ for any $\u03b5> 0$.\n  This appears to be the first algorithmic application of the prime graph characterization and it could be applicable to other modification problems.

It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources.\n  This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5feb\u901f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7531\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u540c\u5316\u96f7\u8fbe\u89c2\u6d4b\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5feb\u901f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684BADA\u5e73\u5747\u4f4e6.7\u500d\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62dfBADA\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u722c\u5347\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u597d46.3%\u548c64.7%\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Prevailing ranking models often rely on fragmented modules and hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to interpret complex user intent. This challenge is further amplified in location-based services such as food delivery, where user decisions are shaped by dynamic spatial, temporal, and individual contexts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework that reframes ranking as a context comprehension task, modeling heterogeneous signals in a unified architecture. Our architecture consists of two core components: the Generative Contextual Encoder (GCE) and the Generative Contextual Fusion (GCF). The GCE comprises three specialized modules: a Personalized Context Enhancer (PCE) for user-specific modeling, a Collective Context Enhancer (CCE) for group-level patterns, and a Dynamic Context Enhancer (DCE) for real-time situational adaptation. The GCF module then seamlessly integrates these contextual representations through low-rank adaptation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves significant gains in critical business metrics, including click-through rate and platform revenue. We have successfully deployed our method on a large-scale food delivery advertising platform, demonstrating its substantial practical impact. This work pioneers a new perspective on generative recommendation and highlights its practical potential in industrial advertising systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u98df\u54c1\u914d\u9001\u5e7f\u544a\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u83b7\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6392\u5e8f\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542bGCE\u548cGCF\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0cGCE\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0cGCF\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96c6\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u5165\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u98df\u54c1\u914d\u9001\u5e7f\u544a\u5e73\u53f0\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f00\u521b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We establish the first capability hierarchy tailored to agent use of professional software and construct a benchmark of 436 realistic work and research tasks spanning 6 disciplines and 13 core professional applications. To ensure reliable and reproducible assessment, we build an executable real-computer environment with an execution-based evaluation framework and uniquely incorporate a human-in-the-loop evaluation paradigm. Extensive experiments show that even the best-performing agent attains only a 24.4\\% success rate on L2 tasks and completely fails on L3 multi-software workflow.

This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information.

They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u5b57AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5c55\u591a\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u3001\u4e2d\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The core idea is to define a fitted distribution using a sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) of push-forwards of the predictors and to quantify deviations from the observed response using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. Regression functions, which map predictors' supports to the response support, and barycenter weights are inferred within a generalized Bayes framework, enabling principled uncertainty quantification without requiring a fully specified likelihood. The inference process can be seen as an instance of an inverse SWB problem. We establish theoretical guarantees, including the stability of the SWB under perturbations of marginals and barycenter weights, sample complexity of the generalized likelihood, and posterior consistency. For practical inference, we introduce a differentiable approximation of the SWB and a smooth reparameterization to handle the simplex constraint on barycenter weights, allowing efficient gradient-based MCMC sampling. We demonstrate MDDR in an application to inference for population-scale single-cell data. Posterior analysis under the MDDR model in this example includes inference on communication between multiple source/sender cell types and a target/receiver cell type.

The model features a concave transient impact driven by a power-law propagator with a resistance term responding to the trader's rate via a fixed-point equation involving a general resistance function. We derive a (non)linear stochastic Fredholm equation as the first-order optimality condition satisfied by optimal trading strategies. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal control are established when the resistance function is linear, and an existence result is obtained when it is strictly convex using coercivity and weak lower semicontinuity of the associated profit-and-loss functional.

Traditional models, trained on a single class of normal data, struggle with real-world distributions where normal data exhibit diverse patterns, leading to class imbalance and long-tailed anomaly score distributions (LTD). This imbalance skews model training and degrades detection performance, especially for minority instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel importance-weighted loss designed specifically for anomaly detection. Compared to the previous method for LTD in classification, our method does not require prior knowledge of normal data classes. Instead, we introduce a weighted loss function that incorporates importance sampling to align the distribution of anomaly scores with a target Gaussian, ensuring a balanced representation of normal data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets and three real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach in mitigating LTD-induced bias.

As is well known, the problem can be solved in $O(nm)$ time using Thompson's algorithm. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the matching problem for regular expressions extended with a practical extension called lookaround can be solved in the same time complexity. In this work, we consider three well-known extensions to regular expressions called backreference, intersection and complement, and we show that, unlike in the case of lookaround, the matching problem for regular expressions extended with any of the three (for backreference, even when restricted to one capturing group) cannot be solved in $O(n^{2-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Moreover, we study the matching problem for regular expressions extended with complement in more detail, which is also known as extended regular expression (ERE) matching. We show that there is no ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{\u03c9-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time ($2 \\le \u03c9< 2.3716$ is the exponent of square matrix multiplication) for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis, and there is no combinatorial ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the Combinatorial $k$-Clique Hypothesis. This shows that the $O(n^3 m)$-time algorithm introduced by Hopcroft and Ullman in 1979 and recently improved by Bille et al. to run in $O(n^\u03c9m)$ time using fast matrix multiplication was already optimal in a sense, and sheds light on why the theoretical computer science community has struggled to improve the time complexity of ERE matching with respect to $n$ and $m$ for more than 45 years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u542b\u56de\u6eaf\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u4ea4\u96c6\u548c\u8865\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u731c\u60f3\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6307\u51faHopcroft\u548cUllman\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u5df2\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u56de\u6eaf\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u4ea4\u96c6\u548c\u8865\u96c6\uff09\u540e\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5411\u91cf\u731c\u60f3\u3001k - \u56e2\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7ec4\u5408k - \u56e2\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u542b\u56de\u6eaf\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u4ea4\u96c6\u548c\u8865\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u731c\u60f3\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0cHopcroft\u548cUllman\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u5df2\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u754c45\u5e74\u6765\u96be\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbERE\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers. However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.\n  We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra. By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability.\n  We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs. Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models. For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5Orchestra\uff0c\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdLLM\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdLLM\u867d\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOrchestra\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u534f\u8c03LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cOrchestra\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Orchestra\u80fd\u6316\u6398\u53ef\u8bbf\u95eeLLM\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u3002"}}

The Digital Twin is intended to support the development and rigorous human-in-the-loop evaluation of AI agents for Air Traffic Control (ATC), providing a virtual representation of real-world airspace that enables safe exploration of higher levels of ATC automation.\n  This paper makes three significant contributions: firstly, we demonstrate how historical and live operational data may be combined with a probabilistic, physics-informed machine learning model of aircraft performance to reproduce real-world traffic scenarios, while accurately reflecting the level of uncertainty inherent in ATC. Secondly, we develop a structured assurance case, following the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance framework, to provide quantitative evidence for the Digital Twin's accuracy and fidelity. This is crucial to building trust in this novel technology within this safety-critical domain. Thirdly, we describe how the Digital Twin forms a unified environment for agent testing and evaluation.

This study examines how the introduction of AI-generated reviews influences RS performance and business outcomes. We analyze two distinct pathways through which AI content can enter RSes: user-centric, in which individuals use AI tools to refine their reviews, and platform-centric, in which platforms generate synthetic reviews directly from structured metadata. Using a large-scale dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, we generate synthetic reviews using LLMs and evaluate their impact across the training and deployment phases of RSes. We find that AI-generated reviews differ systematically from human-authored reviews across multiple textual dimensions. Although both user- and platform-centric AI reviews enhance RS performance relative to models without textual data, models trained on human reviews consistently achieve superior performance, underscoring the quality of authentic human data. Human-trained models generalize robustly to AI content, whereas AI-trained models underperform on both content types. Furthermore, tone-based framing strategies (encouraging, constructive, or critical) substantially enhance platform-generated review effectiveness.

Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption.

Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \\textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \\textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \\textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively.

Quantile regression (QR) not only offers a flexible way to capture heterogeneous effects across the conditional distribution of an outcome, but also naturally produces prediction intervals that help quantify uncertainty in future predictions. However, classical QR methods can face serious memory and computational constraints in large-scale settings. These limitations motivate the use of parallel computing to maintain tractability. While extensive work has examined sample-splitting strategies in settings where the number of observations $n$ greatly exceeds the number of features $p$, the equally important (ultra) high-dimensional regime ($p >> n$) has been comparatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a feature-splitting proximal point algorithm, FS-QRPPA, for penalized QR in high-dimensional regime. Leveraging recent developments in variational analysis, we establish a Q-linear convergence rate for FS-QRPPA and demonstrate its superior scalability in large-scale genomic applications from the UK Biobank relative to existing methods.

The model extends the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to account for the electric properties of the flowing plasma gas and its reaction to the applied magnetic field. The model takes into account various effects, such as the Lorentz force, turbulence, compressibility, and energy extraction from the plasma, and it adopts an electric potential technique along with the low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem) approximation. The model is numerically implemented using the multiphysics open-source computer programming environment \"OpenFOAM,\" which combines the finite volume method (FVM) and the object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by simulating the supersonic channel of the large-scale pulsed MHD generator (PMHDG) called \"Sakhalin\", with the aid of collected data and empirical expressions in the literature about its tested operation. Sakhalin was the world's largest PMHDG, with a demonstrated peak electric power output of 510 MW. Sakhalin operated on solid-propellant plasma (SPP), and it had a single supersonic divergent Faraday-type continuous-electrode channel with a length of 4.5 m. We check the validity of the model through comparisons with independent results for the Sakhalin PMHDG. Then, we process our three-dimensional simulation results to provide scalar characteristics of the Sakhalin channel, one-dimensional profiles along the longitudinal centerline, and three-dimensional distributions in the entire channel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u548cCFD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528OpenFOAM\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5Sakhalin\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u4e3a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df\u71c3\u70e7\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u7ebf\u6027\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c\u578b\u8fde\u7eed\u7535\u6781\u901a\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Favre - \u5e73\u5747Navier - Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u591a\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u52bf\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4f4e\u78c1\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7528OpenFOAM\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6cd5\u548c\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u4e86Sakhalin\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7684\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u5f97\u5230\u901a\u9053\u6807\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4e00\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u901a\u9053\u3002"}}

The proposed scheme allows a miner to probabilistically attest to having searched specified regions of the nonce space in earlier mining rounds, while concurrently earning rewards for performing productive work for a new block or pool share. This capability enables miners belonging to a mining pools to audit another miner's claimed effort retroactively, thereby allowing the probabilistic detection of block withholding attacks (BWAs) without requiring trusted hardware or trusted third parties. As a consequence, the construction supports the design of decentralized mining pools in which work attribution is verifiable and withholding incentives are substantially reduced. The scheme preserves the fundamental properties of conventional PoW, including public verifiability and difficulty adjustment, while adding an orthogonal auditability layer tailored to pool-based mining.

Recently, platforms such as Amazon and Instagram have begun providing recommendation rationales to users, acknowledging their critical role in fostering trust and enhancing engagement; however, most existing systems still treat them as post-hoc artifacts. We propose an LLM-based recommender (LLM-Rec) that not only predicts items but also generates logically grounded rationales. Our approach leverages a self-annotated rationale dataset and instruction tuning in a rationale-first format, where the model generates an explanation before outputting the recommended item.

For more information visit https://orchestral-ai.com", "summary": "The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Python\u6846\u67b6Orchestral\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u4e3b\u8981\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6784\u5efaLLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u9501\u5b9a\u548c\u591a\u5305\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u9762\u4e34API\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u6d88\u606f\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d88\u606f\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u548cLLM\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4ecePython\u7c7b\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u652f\u6301\u6d41\u5f0f\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u5404\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Orchestral\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u65e0\u7f1d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u624b\u52a8\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6846\u67b6\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Orchestral\u4e3a\u8de8\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6784\u5efaLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e14\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6210\u50cf\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u603b\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u603b\u7ed3\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u50cf\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Such training can occupy entire data centers for weeks and requires enormous computational and energy resources. Yet the optimization algorithms behind these runs have not kept pace. Most large scale training still relies on synchronous methods, where workers must wait for the slowest device, wasting compute and amplifying the effects of hardware and network variability. Removing synchronization seems like a simple fix, but asynchrony introduces staleness, meaning updates computed on outdated models. This makes analysis difficult, especially when delays arise from system level randomness rather than algorithmic choices. As a result, the time complexity of asynchronous methods remains poorly understood. This dissertation develops a rigorous framework for asynchronous first order stochastic optimization, focusing on the core challenge of heterogeneous worker speeds. Within this framework, we show that with proper design, asynchronous SGD can achieve optimal time complexity, matching guarantees previously known only for synchronous methods. Our first contribution, Ringmaster ASGD, attains optimal time complexity in the homogeneous data setting by selectively discarding stale updates. The second, Ringleader ASGD, extends optimality to heterogeneous data, common in federated learning, using a structured gradient table mechanism. Finally, ATA improves resource efficiency by learning worker compute time distributions and allocating tasks adaptively, achieving near optimal wall clock time with less computation. Together, these results establish asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and practically efficient foundation for distributed learning, showing that coordination without synchronization can be both feasible and optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u5f02\u6b65\u4e00\u9636\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdRingmaster ASGD\u3001Ringleader ASGD\u548cATA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u672a\u8ddf\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u7f51\u7edc\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f02\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5f02\u6b65\u4e00\u9636\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRingmaster ASGD\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e22\u5f03\u9648\u65e7\u66f4\u65b0\uff1bRingleader ASGD\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u8868\u673a\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff1bATA\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5408\u9002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0b\u5f02\u6b65SGD\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0cATA\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e0\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u8c03\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002"}}

Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis.

These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpikySpace\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eSNN\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7ee7\u627f\u590d\u6742transformer\u5757\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpikySpace\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\u4e8c\u6b21\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5c16\u5cf0\u5e8f\u5217\u66ff\u6362\u5bc6\u96c6SSM\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SiLU\u548cSoftplus\u7b80\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4iTransformer\u548ciSpikformer\uff0cSpikySpace\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u801798.73%\u548c96.24%\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SpikySpace\u8fde\u63a5\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse.

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold.

Treatment leakage occurs when text intended to capture confounding information also contains signals predictive of treatment status, thereby inducing post-treatment bias in causal estimates. Critically, this problem can arise even when documents precede treatment assignment, as authors may employ future-referencing language that anticipates subsequent interventions. Despite growing recognition of this issue, no systematic methods exist for identifying and mitigating treatment leakage in text-as-confounder applications. This paper addresses this gap through three contributions. First, we provide formal statistical and set-theoretic definitions of treatment leakage that clarify when and why bias occurs. Second, we propose four text distillation methods -- similarity-based passage removal, distant supervision classification, salient feature removal, and iterative nullspace projection -- designed to eliminate treatment-predictive content while preserving confounder information. Third, we validate these methods through simulations using synthetic text and an empirical application examining International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programs and child mortality. Our findings indicate that moderate distillation optimally balances bias reduction against confounder retention, whereas overly stringent approaches degrade estimate precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u672c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u6cc4\u6f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u5b50\u5b58\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u6cc4\u6f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5c11\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cbb\u7597\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9002\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u5b50\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6cc4\u6f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u84b8\u998f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis.

The classical graph recommendation model utilizes ID embedding to store essential collaborative information. However, this ID-based paradigm faces challenges in transferring to a new domain, making it hard to build a pre-trained graph recommendation model. This phenomenon primarily stems from two inherent challenges: (1) the non-transferability of ID embeddings due to isolated domain-specific ID spaces, and (2) structural incompatibility between heterogeneous interaction graphs across domains.\n  To address these issues, we propose TextBridgeGNN, a pre-training and fine-tuning framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks. We believe the key lies in how to build the relationship between domains. Specifically, TextBridgeGNN uses text as a semantic bridge to connect domains through multi-level graph propagation. During the pre-training stage, textual information is utilized to break the data islands formed by multiple domains, and hierarchical GNNs are designed to learn both domain-specific and domain-global knowledge with text features, ensuring the retention of collaborative signals and the enhancement of semantics. During the fine-tuning stage, a similarity transfer mechanism is proposed.

While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales.

Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones.

Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards.

This paper presents a system dynamics (SD) modeling framework for analyzing policy and resource dynamics within the construction sector in Sudan, with broader applicability to Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The model incorporates key variables related to workforce, material supply, financing, and policy delays, and is calibrated using genetic algorithms (GAs) based on sectoral data and expert input. Simulation results across four policy scenarios indicate that regulatory reform and workforce training are the most effective levers for improving project performance. Specifically, implementing streamlined regulatory procedures reduced project delays by up to 32%, while investment in human capital decreased cost overruns by 28% over a 10-year simulation horizon. In contrast, scenarios focusing solely on material supply or financial inputs produced limited gains without corresponding policy or labor improvements.

This paper introduces an agentic multi-model testing framework a closed-loop, self-correcting system in which a Test Generation Agent, an Execution and Analysis Agent, and a Review and Optimization Agent collaboratively generate, execute, analyze, and refine tests until convergence. By using sandboxed execution, detailed failure reporting, and iterative regeneration or patching of failing tests, the framework autonomously improves test quality and expands coverage. Integrated into a CI/CD-compatible pipeline, it leverages reinforcement signals from coverage metrics and execution outcomes to guide refinement. Empirical evaluations on microservice based applications show up to a 60% reduction in invalid tests, 30% coverage improvement, and significantly reduced human effort compared to single-model baselines demonstrating that multi-agent, feedback-driven loops can evolve software testing into an autonomous, continuously learning quality assurance ecosystem for self-healing, high-reliability codebases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dAI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u4e3b\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6269\u5927\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u6548\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c99\u76d2\u6267\u884c\u3001\u8be6\u7ec6\u5931\u8d25\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u518d\u751f\u6216\u4fee\u8865\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230CI/CD\u517c\u5bb9\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51cf\u5c1160%\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u9ad830%\uff0c\u4eba\u529b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53ef\u5c06\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u3002"}}

While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib).

As more and more entities move their applications to the blockchain, they generate large volumes of data, and as applications have become more complex, sharing information between different blockchains has become a necessity. This has led to the research and development of interoperable solutions allowing blockchains to connect together. This paper discusses a few blockchain platforms that provide interoperable solutions, emphasising their ability to connect heterogeneous blockchains.

Conventional approaches often struggle with ambiguity, lexicon inconsistencies, and limited contextual understanding, particularly in multi-source news environments. Existing models typically treat sentiment as a secondary feature, reducing their ability to adapt to users' affective preferences. To address these limitations, this study develops an adaptive, sentiment-aware news recommendation framework by integrating hybrid sentiment analysis with reinforcement learning. Using the BBC News dataset, a hybrid sentiment model combines VADER, AFINN, TextBlob, and SentiWordNet scores to generate robust article-level sentiment estimates. Articles are categorised as positive, negative, or neutral, and these sentiment states are embedded within a Q-learning architecture to guide the agent in learning optimal recommendation policies. The proposed system effectively identifies and recommends articles with aligned emotional profiles while continuously improving personalisation through iterative Q-learning updates. The results demonstrate that coupling hybrid sentiment modelling with reinforcement learning provides a feasible, interpretable, and adaptive approach for user-centred news recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u65b0\u95fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u8bcd\u5178\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408VADER\u3001AFINN\u3001TextBlob\u548cSentiWordNet\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6b63\u3001\u8d1f\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u878d\u5165Q - learning\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u60c5\u611f\u5951\u5408\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u6539\u5584\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

Recent work has shown that the BH procedure applied to conformal p-values controls the false discovery rate (FDR). Unfortunately, the BH procedure can lead to over-optimistic assessments near the rejection threshold, with an increase of false discoveries at the margin as pointed out by Soloff et al. (2024). This issue is solved therein by the support line (SL) correction, which is proven to control the boundary false discovery rate (bFDR) in the independent, non-conformal setting. The present work extends the SL method to the conformal setting: first, we show that the SL procedure can violate the bFDR control in this specific setting. Second, we propose several alternatives that provably control the bFDR in the conformal setting.

While several techniques have been proposed to address this, limited empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of applying them to LLM-based industry applications. To fill this gap, we analyzed a chatbot application in an industrial context at Schuberg Philis, a Dutch IT services company. We then selected four techniques, namely Small and Large Model Collaboration, Prompt Optimization, Quantization, and Batching, applied them to the application in eight variations, and then conducted experiments to study their impact on energy consumption, accuracy, and response time compared to the unoptimized baseline.\n  Our results show that several techniques, such as Prompt Optimization and 2-bit Quantization, managed to reduce energy use significantly, sometimes by up to 90%. However, these techniques especially impacted accuracy negatively, to a degree that is not acceptable in practice. The only technique that achieved significant and strong energy reductions without harming the other qualities substantially was Small and Large Model Collaboration via Nvidia's Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier (NPCC) with prompt complexity thresholds. This highlights that reducing the energy consumption of LLM-based applications is not difficult in practice.

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines.

While recent Generative Graph Models (e.g., HiGPT, OFA) demonstrate promising semantic capabilities, their prohibitive inference latency (often exceeding 13 minutes per 1,000 requests) and massive computational costs render them practically undeployable for real-time, million-scale applications. To bridge this gap between generative quality and industrial scalability, we propose TAG-HGT, a cost-effective neuro-symbolic framework. Adopting a decoupled \"Semantics-First, Structure-Refined\" paradigm, TAG-HGT utilizes a frozen Large Language Model (DeepSeek-V3) as an offline semantic factory and distills its knowledge into a lightweight Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via Cross-View Contrastive Learning (CVCL). We present a key insight: while LLM semantics provide necessary global recall, structural signals offer the critical local discrimination needed to distinguish valid collaborators from semantically similar but socially unreachable strangers in dense embedding spaces. Validated under a strict Time-Machine Protocol on the massive OpenAlex dataset, TAG-HGT achieves a SOTA System Recall@10 of 91.97%, outperforming structure-only baselines by 20.7%. Most significantly, from an industrial perspective, TAG-HGT reduces inference latency by five orders of magnitude ($4.5 \\times 10^{5}\\times$) compared to generative baselines (from 780s down to 1.73 ms), and slashes inference costs from $\\sim$$1.50 to $<$$0.001 per 1k queries.

While previous research has proposed green tactics for ML-enabled systems, their empirical evaluation within RAG systems remains largely unexplored. This study presents a controlled experiment investigating five practical techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in RAG systems. Using a production-like RAG system developed at our collaboration partner, the Software Improvement Group, we evaluated the impact of these techniques on energy consumption, latency, and accuracy.\n  Through a total of 9 configurations spanning over 200 hours of trials using the CRAG dataset, we reveal that techniques such as increasing similarity retrieval thresholds, reducing embedding sizes, applying vector indexing, and using a BM25S reranker can significantly reduce energy usage, up to 60% in some cases. However, several techniques also led to unacceptable accuracy decreases, e.g., by up to 30% for the indexing strategies. Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient.

The existing theory for HFHR dynamics in the literature is restricted to strongly-convex $U$, although numerical experiments are promising for non-convex settings as well. We focus on studying the convergence of HFHR dynamics when $U$ can be non-convex, which bridges a gap between theory and practice. Under a standard assumption of dissipativity and smoothness on $U$, we adopt the reflection/synchronous coupling method. This yields a Lyapunov-weighted Wasserstein distance in which the HFHR semigroup is exponentially contractive for all sufficiently small $\u03b1>0$ whenever KLD is. We further show that, under an additional assumption that asymptotically $\\nabla U$ has linear growth at infinity, the contraction rate for HFHR dynamics is strictly better than that of KLD, with an explicit gain. As a case study, we verify the assumptions and the resulting acceleration for three examples: a multi-well potential, Bayesian linear regression with $L^p$ regularizer and Bayesian binary classification. We conduct numerical experiments based on these examples, as well as an additional example of Bayesian logistic regression with real data processed by the neural networks, which illustrates the efficiency of the algorithms based on HFHR dynamics and verifies the acceleration and superior performance compared to KLD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u4e0bHessian - free\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08HFHR\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u5c04/\u540c\u6b65\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8eKLD\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HFHR\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5f3a\u51f8U\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u975e\u51f8U\u65f6\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5728U\u7684\u8017\u6563\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u5c04/\u540c\u6b65\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230Lyapunov\u52a0\u6743Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eHFHR\u534a\u7fa4\u6307\u6570\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6536\u7f29\u7387\u4f18\u4e8eKLD\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8eHFHR\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "HFHR\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u6bd4KLD\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Failing to capture these preferences can lead to suboptimal diversity in recommendations. To fill this gap, this work aims to study diversified recommendation from a data-bias perspective. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot inference leveraging world knowledge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLMs' expertise to uncover underexplored user preferences from observed behavior, ultimately providing diverse and relevant recommendations. To achieve this, we first introduce Tree of Preferences (ToP), an innovative structure constructed to model user preferences from coarse to fine. ToP enables LLMs to systematically reason over the user's rationale behind their behavior, thereby uncovering their underexplored preferences. To guide diversified recommendations using uncovered preferences, we adopt a data-centric approach, identifying candidate items that match user preferences and generating synthetic interactions that reflect underexplored preferences. These interactions are integrated to train a general recommender for diversification. Moreover, we scale up overall efficiency by dynamically selecting influential users during optimization. Extensive evaluations of both diversity and relevance show that our approach outperforms existing methods in most cases and achieves near-optimal performance in others, with reasonable inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63ed\u793a\u7528\u6237\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaToP\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u597d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u89c2\u5bdf\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u7528\u6237\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u6784\u5efaTree of Preferences (ToP) \u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5408\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

This paper presents PerspectiveCoach, a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational tool designed to guide developers through structured perspective-taking exercises and deepen critical reflection on how software design decisions affect marginalized communities. Through a controlled study with 18 front-end developers (balanced by sex), who interacted with the tool using a real case of online gender-based harassment, we examine how PerspectiveCoach supports ethical reasoning and engagement with user perspectives. Qualitative analysis revealed increased self-awareness, broadened perspectives, and more nuanced ethical articulation, while a complementary human-human study contextualized these findings. Text similarity analyses demonstrated that participants in the human-PerspectiveCoach study improved the fidelity of their restatements over multiple attempts, capturing both surface-level and semantic aspects of user concerns. However, human-PerspectiveCoach's restatements had a lower baseline than the human-human conversations, highlighting contextual differences in impersonal and interpersonal perspective-taking. Across the study, participants rated the tool highly for usability and relevance.

We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u591a\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51famax - p\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51famax - p\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528max - p\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions.

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects.

This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength.

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization.

To mitigate this issue, memory-based continual learning has been widely adopted for IR. However, existing methods rely on a fixed set of queries with ground-truth relevant documents, which limits generalization to unseen queries and documents, making them impractical for real-world applications. To enable more effective learning with unseen topics of a new corpus without ground-truth labels, we propose CREAM, a self-supervised framework for memory-based continual retrieval. CREAM captures the evolving semantics of streaming queries and documents into dynamically structured soft memory and leverages it to adapt to both seen and unseen topics in an unsupervised setting. We realize this through three key techniques: fine-grained similarity estimation, regularized cluster prototyping, and stratified coreset sampling. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CREAM exhibits superior adaptability and retrieval accuracy, outperforming the strongest method in a label-free setting by 27.79\\% in Success@5 and 44.5\\% in Recall@10 on average, and achieving performance comparable to or even exceeding that of supervised methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCREAM\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u65b0\u4e3b\u9898\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u65b0\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCREAM\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u4e49\u6355\u83b7\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u8f6f\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCREAM\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cSuccess@5\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad827.79%\uff0cRecall@10\u9ad844.5%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "CREAM\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u65b0\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

DOI 10.1145/3744916.3787832", "summary": "Execution traces are a critical source of information for understanding, debugging, and optimizing complex software systems. However, traces from OS kernels or large-scale applications like Chrome or MySQL are massive and difficult to analyze. Existing tools rely on predefined analyses, and custom insights often require writing domain-specific scripts, which is an error-prone and time-consuming task. This paper introduces TAAF (Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework), a novel approach that combines time-indexing, knowledge graphs (KGs), and large language models (LLMs) to transform raw trace data into actionable insights. TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks. We further analyze where graph-grounded reasoning helps and where limitations remain, offering a foundation for next-generation trace analysis tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTAAF\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u56fe\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u9700\u7f16\u5199\u7279\u5b9a\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u56fe\u3002\u5f15\u5165TraceQA - 100\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAAF\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad831.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recent advancements show that incorporating propagation dynamics can significantly enhance detection performance compared to previous content-only approaches. However, this remains challenging at early stages due to the absence of observable propagation signals. To address this limitation, we propose AVOID, an \\underline{a}gent-driven \\underline{v}irtual pr\\underline{o}pagat\\underline{i}on for early fake news \\underline{d}etection. AVOID reformulates early detection as a new paradigm of evidence generation, where propagation signals are actively simulated rather than passively observed. Leveraging LLM-powered agents with differentiated roles and data-driven personas, AVOID realistically constructs early-stage diffusion behaviors without requiring real propagation data.

However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations.

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation.

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity.

On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement. Our experimental results with Llama 3.1 8B models (trained on a dataset of 110K data points and evaluated on 5K held-out user-title pairs) show that the post-trained LLMs achieve 3-5\\% improvements over the Netflix production model, suggesting a promising direction for granular personalized recommendations using LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u591a\u6837\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u827a\u672f\u4f5c\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4Netflix\u751f\u4ea7\u6a21\u578b\u67093 - 5%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5a31\u4e50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u827a\u672f\u4f5c\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6807\u9898\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.1 8B\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4Netflix\u751f\u4ea7\u6a21\u578b\u67093 - 5%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u548cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76SRE\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAMER - RCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u9891\u53d1\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u548cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76SRE\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAMER - RCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406RCL\u5f15\u64ce\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u5019\u9009\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u590d\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eAMER - RCL\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AMER - RCL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons.

In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels.

While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237 - \u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347AUC\u548cCTR\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u591a\u6837\u4e30\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5bf9\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237 - \u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ef4\u8003\u8651\u591a\u6837\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6e90\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u957f\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7528\u989d\u5916\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u4e30\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u8bc4\u4f30\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5bf9\u77ed\u5728\u7ebf\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u80fd\u4f7f\u5e7f\u544a\u5c55\u793a\u6765\u6e90\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\u659c\u7387\u63d0\u53471.56 - 2\u500d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u5e7f\u544a\u5c55\u793a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6e90\u4f7f\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u53470.56% AUC", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237 - \u5e7f\u544a\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387"}}

Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \\textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff08RCA\uff09\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684RCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSpecRCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6709\u6548RCA\u5bf9\u4fdd\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684RCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578bLLM\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpecRCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u5047\u8bbe - \u9a8c\u8bc1\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5148\u5229\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u8d77\u8349\u6a21\u5757\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6839\u56e0\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u6839\u56e0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIOps 2022\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSpecRCA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecRCA\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684RCA\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios.

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms.

Different from traditional e-commerce, live-streaming e-commerce shifts the focus from products to streamers, which requires ranking mechanism to balance both purchases and user-streamer interactions for long-term ecology. To trade off multiple objectives, a popular solution is to build an ensemble model to integrate multi-objective scores into a unified score. The ensemble model is usually supervised by multiple independent binary classification losses of all objectives. However, this paradigm suffers from two inherent limitations. First, the optimization direction of the binary classification task is misaligned with the ranking task (evaluated by AUC). Second, this paradigm overlooks the alignment between objectives, e.g., comment and buy behaviors are partially dependent which can be revealed in labels correlations. The model can achieve better trade-offs if it learns the aligned parts of ranking abilities among different objectives.\n  To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel multi-objective ensemble framework HarmonRank to fulfill both alignment to the ranking task and alignment among objectives.

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6MAFS\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "MAFS\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u5e76\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMAFS\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "MAFS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for classifying bug reports to identify security bug reports rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data. However, datasets for security bug reports are often scarce in practice, leading to poor model performance and limited applicability in real-world settings. In this study, we propose a few-shot learning-based technique to effectively identify security bug reports using limited labeled data. We employ SetFit, a state-of-the-art few-shot learning framework that combines sentence transformers with contrastive learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The model is trained on a small labeled dataset of bug reports and is evaluated on its ability to classify these reports as either security-related or non-security-related. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.865, at best, outperforming traditional ML techniques (baselines) for all of the evaluated datasets.

We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReTreVal\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReTreVal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u601d\u60f3\u6811\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u5b8c\u5584\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Qwen 2.5 7B\u5728500\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cReTreVal\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684ReAct\u3001Reflexion\u548cSelf - Refine\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReTreVal\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b8c\u5584\u548c\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

PLR constructs parallel reasoning streams through learnable trigger tokens in continuous latent space, preserves diversity across streams via global reasoning regularization, and adaptively synthesizes multi-stream outputs through mixture-of-reasoning-streams aggregation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PLR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining real-time inference efficiency.

In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u62b5\u5fa1\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). To overcome the lack of high-quality and accessible datasets in the enterprise domain, our method leverages on synthetic data generation. Specifically, we employ an LLM to synthesize realistic enterprise queries from a seed document, apply BM25 to retrieve hard negatives, and use a teacher LLM to assign relevance scores. The resulting dataset is then distilled into an SLM, producing a compact relevance labeler. We evaluate our approach on a high-quality benchmark consisting of 923 enterprise query-document pairs annotated by trained human annotators, and show that the distilled SLM achieves agreement with human judgments on par with or better than the teacher LLM. Furthermore, our fine-tuned labeler substantially improves throughput, achieving 17 times increase while also being 19 times more cost-effective.

While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6f6e\u6d41\uff08OPF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f29\u653e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8d44\u6e90\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3aML - OPF\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OPF\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684OPF\u5728\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\uff080.1K - 40K\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u4e0d\u540cFLOPs\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f29\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5728DNNs\u548cPINNs\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cACOPF\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684OPF\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3aML - OPF\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, have become central to real-time news sharing, advocacy, and propaganda. In this study, we analyze Telegram, Twitter/X, and Reddit to examine how conflict narratives are produced, amplified, and contested across different digital spheres. Building on our previous work on Telegram discourse during the 2023 escalation, we extend the analysis longitudinally and cross-platform using an updated dataset spanning October 2023 to mid-2025. The corpus includes more than 187,000 Telegram messages, 2.1 million Reddit comments, and curated Twitter/X posts. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and transformer-based sentiment and emotion models to identify dominant themes, emotional dynamics, and propaganda strategies. Telegram channels provide unfiltered, high-intensity documentation of events; Twitter/X amplifies frames to global audiences; and Reddit hosts more reflective and deliberative discussions. Our findings reveal persistent negative sentiment, strong coupling between humanitarian framing and solidarity expressions, and platform-specific pathways for the diffusion of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli narratives. This paper offers three contributions: (1) a multi-platform, FAIR-compliant dataset on the Israel-Hamas war, (2) an integrated pipeline combining topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, and spam filtering for large-scale conflict discourse, and (3) empirical insights into how platform affordances and affective publics shape the evolution of digital conflict communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790Telegram\u3001Twitter/X\u548cReddit\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5df4\u4ee5\u51b2\u7a81\u53d9\u4e8b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u5b57\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4e89\u8bae\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u70b9\u53ca\u4f20\u64ad\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df4\u4ee5\u51b2\u7a81\u57282023\u5e7410\u6708\u5347\u7ea7\u540e\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6210\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u51b2\u7a81\u53d9\u4e8b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u76842023\u5e7410\u6708\u81f32025\u5e74\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LDA\u3001BERTopic\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Telegram\u9891\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u539f\u59cb\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0cTwitter/X\u5411\u5168\u7403\u4f20\u64ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0cReddit\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u56e2\u7ed3\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u5408\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u51b2\u7a81\u4f20\u64ad\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e5G/6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u7b54\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Contextual RAG\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "O - RAN\u5feb\u53d8\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u63a5\u53e3\u7ed9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53ca\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u67e5\u9605\u6587\u6863\u7e41\u7410\u6613\u9519\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Contextual RAG\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u5f15\u5bfc\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528ORANBenchmark - 13K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Contextual RAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6RAG\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u793a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548cCO2\u6392\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "Contextual RAG\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3aORAN\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb5G/6G\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.\n  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.\n  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.\n  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection.

We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories.

However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios.

Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents.

Feedback welcome", "summary": "CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.\n  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eCTMC/DTMC\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u98ce\u9669\u91c7\u6837\uff08SHS\uff09\u539f\u5219\u53ca\u76f8\u5206\u914d\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eCTMC/DTMC\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8f91\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6b20\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u98ce\u9669\u91c7\u6837\uff08SHS\uff09\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u6765\u5b89\u6392\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ed1\u540d\u5355\u5f0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u76f8\u5206\u914d\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "SHS\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6bcf\u6b21\u8df3\u8dc3\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65e0\u504f\u6574\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a1/4\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SHS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eCTMC/DTMC\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u5206\u914d\u53d8\u4f53\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u9ed1\u540d\u5355\u5f0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u671f\u63a9\u7801\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs.

However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions).

Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods.

This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.\n  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\u03a9((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\u03a9((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes.

The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model.

Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios.

We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery.

We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward.

Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning.

We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus.

Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole.

In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics.

We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCausal Manifold Fairness (CMF)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210SCMs\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u654f\u611f\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u9759\u6001\u70b9\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CMF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5219\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210SCMs\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u654f\u611f\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u4e25\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u516c\u5e73 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CMF\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7531\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We identify several methodological pitfalls in current AI research on reasoning, including the inability to verify the novelty of findings due to opaque and non-searchable training data, the lack of reproducibility caused by continuous model updates, and the omission of human-interaction transcripts, which obscures the true source of scientific discovery. Additionally, the absence of counterfactuals and data on failed attempts creates a selection bias that may exaggerate LLM capabilities.

If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

These tools must support efficient evaluation of key performance metrics such as coverage and radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure, inform network design decisions, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds.

Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u591a\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65b0\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08AUC\uff09\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe89.71%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002"}}

Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $\u0394$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \\textsc{CivilComments} and \\textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\\varepsilon=0.02$ for \\textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs.

We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry.

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task-specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality.

By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems demand self-organizing network intelligence capable of autonomously managing resources, topology, and services. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning-driven and data-centric methods, has become a key enabler for realizing this vision. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level review of AI-native ISAC-enabled self-organizing wireless networks. We develop a unified taxonomy that spans: (i) ISAC signal models and sensing modalities, (ii) network state abstraction and perception from sensing-aware radio data, (iii) learning-driven self-organization mechanisms for resource allocation, topology control, and mobility management, and (iv) cross-layer architectures integrating sensing, communication, and network intelligence. We further examine emerging learning paradigms, including deep reinforcement learning, graph-based learning, multi-agent coordination, and federated intelligence that enable autonomous adaptation under uncertainty, mobility, and partial observability. Practical considerations such as sensing-communication trade-offs, scalability, latency, reliability, and security are discussed alongside representative evaluation methodologies and performance metrics.

Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \\textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \\textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9996\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u51c6PCEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd513\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5305\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PCEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7535\u8def\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf913\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u9762\u5305\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u56f0\u96be\u5927\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f15\u811a\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7535\u8def\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "PCEval\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2dAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6559\u80b2\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ee5\u63d0\u793a\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u878d\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u60f3\u4e86\u89e3\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u505a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u793a - \u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u793a - \u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ee5\u63d0\u793a\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9762\u4e34\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime.

Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task.

Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones.

Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences.

Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts.

To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions.

Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness.

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device.

However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers.

Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.\n  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech.

We evaluate the robustness of a hybrid quantum machine learning model, quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) against classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under four acoustic corruptions (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation) in a clean-train/corrupted-test regime. Using AVFAD (voice pathology) and TESS (speech emotion), we compare three QNN models (Random, Basic, Strongly) to a simple CNN baseline (CNN-Base), ResNet-18 and VGG-16 using accuracy and corruption metrics (CE, mCE, RCE, RmCE), and analyze architectural factors (circuit complexity or depth, convergence) alongside per-emotion robustness. QNNs generally outperform the CNN-Base under pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation (up to 22% lower CE/RCE at severe temporal shift), while the CNN-Base remains more resilient to Gaussian noise. Among quantum circuits, QNN-Basic achieves the best overall robustness on AVFAD, and QNN-Random performs strongest on TESS. Emotion-wise, fear is most robust (80-90% accuracy under severe corruptions), neutral can collapse under strong Gaussian noise (5.5% accuracy), and happy is most vulnerable to pitch, temporal, and speed distortions. QNNs also converge up to six times faster than the CNN-Base.

Methods: In this prospective study, 42 participants underwent 7T knee MRI with LR (0.8*0.8*2 mm3) and HR (0.4*0.4*2 mm3) sequences. SR images were generated from LR data using a Hybrid Attention Transformer model. Three radiologists assessed image quality, anatomic conspicuity, and detection of knee pathologies. Arthroscopy served as reference in 10 cases. Results: SR images showed higher overall quality than LR (median score 5 vs 4, P<.001) and lower noise than HR (5 vs 4, P<.001). Visibility of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments was superior in SR and HR compared to LR (P<.001).

While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX-Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks -- including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning -- our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation.

Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season.

VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \\[ \\mathcal{L}u = f \\quad \\text{in} \\quad Q=\u03a9\\times(0,T), \\] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space-time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \\[ u_N(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\\,\u03c6_n(x,t), \\] where $\u03c6_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u53d8\u5206\u8c31\u5b66\u4e60\uff08VSL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u8c31\u5c55\u5f00\u7cfb\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u5e76\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u53d8\u5206PDE\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8c31\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06PDE\u53ca\u5176\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u79efChebyshev\u57fa\u8868\u793a\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5f31\u5f62\u5f0f\u6cdb\u51fd\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528TensorFlow\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u692d\u5706\u548c\u629b\u7269\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cVSL\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8c31\u914d\u70b9\u6cd5\u52a0Crank - Nicolson\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "VSL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPCC\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u80fd\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5ffd\u89c6\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PCC\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u8a00\u8bed\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "PCC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors.

Existing approaches rely on manually crafted transformation rules to preserve watermarked code functionality or manipulate token-generation probabilities at inference time, which are prone to compilation errors. To address these challenges, SWaRL employs a reinforcement learning-based co-training framework that uses compiler feedback for functional correctness and a jointly trained confidential verifier as a reward signal to maintain watermark detectability. Furthermore, SWaRL employs low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during fine-tuning, allowing the learned watermark information to be transferable across model updates. Extensive experiments show that SWaRL achieves higher watermark detection accuracy compared to prior methods while fully maintaining watermarked code functionality.

Energy-Based Models (EBMs), with their interpretable energy landscapes and compositional structure, are well-suited for this task but have historically suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome the historical shortcomings of EBMs, we introduce a fast distillation strategy to transfer the strengths of pre-trained diffusion models into multi-scale EBMs. These distilled EBMs enable efficient sampling and preserve the interpretability and compositionality inherent to potential-based frameworks. Leveraging EBM compositionality, we propose Annealed Langevin Posterior Sampling (ALPS) algorithm for Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), and uncertainty estimates for inverse problems in imaging. Unlike diffusion models that use complex guidance strategies for latent variables, we perform annealing on static posterior distributions that are well-defined and composable. Experiments on image inpainting and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, while also supporting MAP recovery. Overall, our framework offers a scalable and principled solution for inverse problems in imaging, with potential for practical deployment in scientific and clinical settings.

In contrast to existing benchmarks that assume well-specified schemas and inputs, LongDA targets real-world settings in which navigating long documentation and complex data is the primary bottleneck. To this end, we manually curate raw data files, long and heterogeneous documentation, and expert-written publications from 17 publicly available U.S. national surveys, from which we extract 505 analytical queries grounded in real analytical practice. Solving these queries requires agents to first retrieve and integrate key information from multiple unstructured documents, before performing multi-step computations and writing executable code, which remains challenging for existing data analysis agents. To support the systematic evaluation under this setting, we develop LongTA, a tool-augmented agent framework that enables document access, retrieval, and code execution, and evaluate a range of proprietary and open-source models.

Traditional methods produce hard partitions, whereas soft clustering methods such as fuzzy $c$-means (FCM) allow mixed memberships and better capture uncertainty and gradual transitions. Despite the widespread use of FCM, principled statistical inference for fuzzy clustering remains limited.\n  We develop a new framework for weighted fuzzy $c$-means (WFCM) for settings with potential cluster size imbalance. Cluster-specific weights rebalance the classical FCM criterion so that smaller clusters are not overwhelmed by dominant groups, and the weighted objective induces a normalized density model with scale parameter $\u03c3$ and fuzziness parameter $m$. Estimation is performed via a blockwise majorize--minimize (MM) procedure that alternates closed-form membership and centroid updates with likelihood-based updates of $(\u03c3,\\bw)$. The intractable normalizing constant is approximated by importance sampling using a data-adaptive Gaussian mixture proposal. We further provide likelihood ratio tests for comparing cluster centers and bootstrap-based confidence intervals.\n  We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, validate the method through simulations, and illustrate it using single-cell RNA-seq and Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data.

While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

One of the fundamental steps in the pre-silicon security verification of a hardware design is the identification of security assets, as it substantially influences downstream security verification tasks, such as threat modeling, security property generation, and vulnerability detection. Traditionally, assets are determined manually by security experts, requiring significant time and expertise. To address this challenge, we present LAsset, a novel automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify security assets from both hardware design specifications and register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions. The framework performs structural and semantic analysis to identify intra-module primary and secondary assets and derives inter-module relationships to systematically characterize security dependencies at the design level. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy, reaching up to 90% recall rate in SoC design, and 93% recall rate in IP designs. This automation in asset identification significantly reduces manual overhead and supports a scalable path forward for secure hardware development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3SoC\u548cIP\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6108\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u53d8\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u5de5\u786e\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u8d44\u4ea7\u8017\u65f6\u4e13\u4e1a\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528LLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6846\u67b6LAsset\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u8d44\u4ea7\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAsset\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u683c\u548c\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u5185\u4e3b\u6b21\u8981\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0cSoC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe90%\uff0cIP\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe93%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d44\u4ea7\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

It is a difficult time series forecasting (TSF) problem that has been addressed by Deep Learning (DL) models due to their ability to capture complex patterns.

However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -- including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction -- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy. Results highlight performance regimes, efficiency thresholds, and promising architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness to traffic challenges and suggesting new directions beyond traditional RNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f3012\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u6307\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u591a\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u786e\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5c0612\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e09\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6548\u7387\u9608\u503c\u548c\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6d41\u91cf\u6311\u6218\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDreamLoop\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u7167\u7247\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u6280\u672f\u53ea\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7247\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u7f1d\u53ef\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u6865\u63a5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u5c3e\u5e27\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u6301\u80cc\u666f\u9759\u6b62\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8def\u5f84\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u753b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "DreamLoop\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamLoop\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Typical statistical postprocessing methods correct these biases, but often degrade spatio-temporal correlation structures in doing so. Recent works based on generative modeling successfully improve spatial correlation structures but have to forecast every lead time independently. In contrast, STIPP makes joint spatio-temporal forecasts which have increased accuracy for surface temperature, wind, relative humidity and precipitation when compared to baseline methods. It makes hourly ensemble predictions given only a six-hourly deterministic forecast, blending the boundaries of postprocessing and temporal interpolation.

We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, data-driven gravity inversion methods based on deep learning (DL) possess physical property recovery capabilities that conventional regularization methods lack. However, existing DL methods suffer from insufficient prior information constraints, which leads to inversion models with large data fitting errors and unreliable results. Moreover, the inversion results lack constraints and matching from other exploration methods, leading to results that may contradict known geological conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates prior density well logging information to address the above issues. First, we introduce a depth weighting function to the neural network (NN) and train it in the weighted density parameter domain. The NN, under the constraint of the weighted forward operator, demonstrates improved inversion performance, with the resulting inversion model exhibiting smaller data fitting errors. Next, we divide the entire network training into two phases: first training a large pre-trained network Net-I, and then using the density logging information as the constraint to get the optimized fine-tuning network Net-II.

We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\\% $\\rightarrow$ 67.5\\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\\sim$8s $\\rightarrow$ $\\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\\% at $\\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains.

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data.

In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video.

Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images.

Recently, a multi-channel transformer (MCT) has been proposed, which demonstrates the ability of the transformer to model far-field acoustic environments. However, MCT cannot encode high-dimensional acoustic features for each speaker from mixed input audio because of the interference between speakers. Based on these, we propose the multi-channel multi-speaker transformer (M2Former) for far-field multi-speaker ASR in this paper. Experiments on the SMS-WSJ benchmark show that the M2Former outperforms the neural beamformer, MCT, dual-path RNN with transform-average-concatenate and multi-channel deep clustering based end-to-end systems by 9.2%, 14.3%, 24.9%, and 52.2% respectively, in terms of relative word error rate reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u573a\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7684M2Former\uff0c\u5728SMS - WSJ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f1a\u8bae\u548c\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fdc\u573a\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6210\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709MCT\u56e0\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5e72\u6270\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u901a\u9053\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08M2Former\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u573a\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728SMS - WSJ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cM2Former\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u795e\u7ecf\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u3001MCT\u3001\u53cc\u8def\u5f84RNN\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u901a\u9053\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad89.2%\u300114.3%\u300124.9%\u548c52.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "M2Former\u5728\u8fdc\u573a\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Adaptive self-consistency methods mitigate this issue by adjusting the sampling budget; however, they rely on count-based stopping rules that treat all responses equally, often leading to unnecessary sampling. We propose Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency (ReASC), which addresses this limitation by reframing adaptive sampling from response counting to evidence sufficiency, leveraging response-level confidence for principled information aggregation. ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters.

To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets.

Existing blockchain-based platforms leverage verifiable credentials but typically lack automated skill-credential generation and the ability to incorporate unstructured evidence of learning.

Digitally signed transcripts from educational institutions are accepted, and verifiable self-issued skill credentials are derived inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) by a natural language processing pipeline that analyzes formal records (e.g., transcripts, syllabi) and informal artifacts. All verification and job-skill matching are performed inside the enclave with selective disclosure, so raw credentials and private keys remain enclave-confined. Job matching relies solely on attested skill vectors and is invariant to non-skill resume fields, thereby reducing opportunities for screening bias.The NLP component was evaluated on sample learner data; the mapping follows the validated Syllabus-to-O*NET methodology,and a stability test across repeated runs observed <5% variance in top-ranked skills.

The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u56fe\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u7528Grounded SAM2\u8bc6\u522b\u524d\u666f\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u524d\u666f\u5360\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7c7b\u522b\u56fe\u5757\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPiDR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u8d8529%\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u5b58\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u3001\u96be\u7528\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0d\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPiDR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c06\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u539f\u7406\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u822a\u884c\u5668\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u8d8529%\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "PiDR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6076\u52a3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e9\u505c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e9f\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u8bd5\u56fe\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e9\u505c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u8d85\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e9\u505c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e9\u505c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u201cLess is Less\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds.

We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths.

Existing NACs can be divided into two categories: multi-codebook and single-codebook codecs. Multi-codebook codecs face challenges such as structural complexity and difficulty in adapting to downstream tasks, while single-codebook codecs, though structurally simpler, suffer from low-fidelity, ineffective modeling of unified audio, and an inability to support modeling of high-frequency audio. We propose the UniSRCodec, a single-codebook codec capable of supporting high sampling rate, low-bandwidth, high fidelity, and unified. We analyze the inefficiency of waveform-based compression and introduce the time and frequency compression method using the Mel-spectrogram, and cooperate with a Vocoder to recover the phase information of the original audio. Moreover, we propose a sub-band reconstruction technique to achieve high-quality compression across both low and high frequency bands. Subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that UniSRCodec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among cross-domain single-codebook codecs with only a token rate of 40, and its reconstruction quality is comparable to that of certain multi-codebook methods.

We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faToxiGAN\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u76d1\u7763\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToxiGAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e2d\u6027\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u6027\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cToxiGAN\u5728\u5b8fF1\u548c\u4ec7\u6068F1\u65b9\u9762\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002"}}

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation.

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD.

To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly.

It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo.

We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($\u03c1= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($\u03c1\\approx 0.1$).

Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off.

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance.

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework.

In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute.

Real-world audio deepfake detection (ADD) therefore requires all-type detectors that generalize across heterogeneous audio and provide interpretable decisions. Given the strong multi-task generalization ability of ALLMs, we first investigate their performance on all-type ADD under both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, SFT using only binary real/fake labels tends to reduce the model to a black-box classifier, sacrificing interpretability. Meanwhile, vanilla RFT under sparse supervision is prone to reward hacking and can produce hallucinated, ungrounded rationales. To address this, we propose an automatic annotation and polishing pipeline that constructs Frequency-Time structured chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, producing ~340K cold-start demonstrations. Building on CoT data, we propose Frequency Time-Group Relative Policy Optimization (FT-GRPO), a two-stage training paradigm that cold-starts ALLMs with SFT and then applies GRPO under rule-based frequency-time constraints.

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation.

However, their validation remains challenging because each task induces its own operational context and correctness specification, exceeding the assumptions of traditional validation methods.

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur.

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods.

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query.

Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially \"trained\" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u4ea7\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u4e0e\u65b0\u751f\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8111\u548c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u5171\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u548c\u5927\u8111\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7a76\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u5927\u8111\u4e00\u6837\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u82e5\u50cf\u5927\u8111\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u4ea7\u524d\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u4e0e\u65b0\u751f\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u6ce2\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u4ea7\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u6ce2\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u65b0\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u5f62\u72b6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u5c42\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8111\u548c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u4ee5\u5171\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u62df\u5408\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUnified Thinker\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406 - \u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUnified Thinker\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u8003\u5668\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cUnified Thinker\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Unified Thinker\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

In computer vision, geo-localization has served as a demanding benchmark for compositional reasoning and is relevant to public safety. In contrast, progress on audio geo-localization has been constrained by the lack of high-quality audio-location pairs. To address this gap, we introduce AGL1K, the first audio geo-localization benchmark for audio language models (ALMs), spanning 72 countries and territories. To extract reliably localizable samples from a crowd-sourced platform, we propose the Audio Localizability metric that quantifies the informativeness of each recording, yielding 1,444 curated audio clips. Evaluations on 16 ALMs show that ALMs have emerged with audio geo-localization capability. We find that closed-source models substantially outperform open-source models, and that linguistic clues often dominate as a scaffold for prediction. We further analyze ALMs' reasoning traces, regional bias, error causes, and the interpretability of the localizability metric. Overall, AGL1K establishes a benchmark for audio geo-localization and may advance ALMs with better geospatial reasoning capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9996\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6AGL1K\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3016\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ALMs\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cAGL1K\u6216\u63a8\u52a8ALMs\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u97f3\u9891\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u97f3\u9891 - \u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u800c\u8fdb\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AGL1K\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u97f3\u9891\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bf916\u4e2aALMs\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u533a\u57df\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u3002", "result": "ALMs\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u97f3\u9891\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e38\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "AGL1K\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347ALMs\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efaRXL - RADSet\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578bRAD\u5206\u7ea7\u5206\u914d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8RADS\u5206\u914d\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u521b\u5efa\u7efc\u5408RADS\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b1600\u4efd\u62a5\u544a\u7684RXL - RADSet\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f3041\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cGPT - 5.2\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0cGPT - 5.2\u6709\u6548\u602799.8%\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u602781.1%\uff1b\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6c47\u603b\u6709\u6548\u602796.8%\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u602761.1%\uff1b\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "RXL - RADSet\u53ef\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5927\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}
