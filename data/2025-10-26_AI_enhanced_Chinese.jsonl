Water transport\nfollows Fick's second law with a damage-dependent diffusivity obtained by\npower-law interpolation between intact concrete and crack space. Healing\nreduces damage in proportion to local moisture and a smoothed cement\navailability field computed via a Helmholtz filter. Two finite element variants\nwere implemented in FEniCSx over time horizons up to $5\\times10^6$ seconds: a\nCrack Diffusion Model (CDM) with standard diffusion and a Crack Membrane Model\n(CMM) that gates cross-crack transport until a critical moisture threshold is\nreached. Key control parameters are the initial crack orientation and size, the\ndiffusion coefficients of intact and cracked concrete, the healing rate\nconstant, and the cement availability smoothing parameter. Simulations on a\nunit square domain show that healing time varies non-monotonically with crack\norientation, peaking near $45^\\circ$ and $135^\\circ$ and minimizing near\n$90^\\circ$, consistent with diffusion distance to crack endpoints dominating\nthe process. The dependence on crack width reverses with material parameters:\nhealing time increases when $D_{\\text{cracked}}<D_{\\text{intact}}$ and\ndecreases when $D_{\\text{cracked}}>D_{\\text{intact}}$. The CMM reproduces\nstaged moisture penetration with delayed gate activation but lengthens total\nhealing time, whereas the CDM is efficient for parametric sweeps. Machine\nlearning classifiers trained on one million simulation samples predict binary\nhealing outcomes $H(\\sigma,\\gamma,t)$ (healed or not) with high accuracy (up to\n0.998 for neural networks). Although experimental calibration is still\nrequired, the framework provides a versatile tool for guiding laboratory\nstudies and implementations of self-healing concrete.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u6108\u5408\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c34\u5206\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u635f\u4f24\u6f14\u5316\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u6108\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u6108\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u8026\u5408\u6c34\u5206\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u635f\u4f24\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6108\u5408\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u65f6\u53d8\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6c34\u5206\u4f20\u8f93\u9075\u5faa\u83f2\u514b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7528\u5e42\u5f8b\u63d2\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u635f\u4f24\u76f8\u5173\u6269\u6563\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6c34\u6ce5\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u573a\uff0c\u5728FEniCSx\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u6709\u9650\u5143\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6108\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u88c2\u7f1d\u65b9\u5411\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0e\u88c2\u7f1d\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u968f\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff1bCMM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u518d\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u6c34\u5206\u6e17\u900f\u4f46\u5ef6\u957f\u603b\u6108\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\uff0cCDM\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u6108\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u9700\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u6108\u5408\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a\nworst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities\nhave minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for\nvalue alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural\nto suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the\nfirst study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and\nrandomized voting rules.

This result is shown through a new technique,\ncalled round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful\nand presents very nice ideas.

Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides\nthe following contributions.\n  1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via\nself-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to\nobtain the following two hardness results.\n  2.

The harmonic mean estimator (HME) has long been a standard method of\napproximating the evidence. While computationally simple, the version\nintroduced by Newton and Raftery (1994) potentially suffers from infinite\nvariance. To overcome this issue, Gelfand and Dey (1994) defined a standardized\nrepresentation of the estimator based on an instrumental function and Robert\nand Wraith (2009) later proposed to use higher posterior density (HPD)\nindicators as instrumental functions. Following this approach, a practical\nmethod is proposed, based on an elliptical covering of the HPD region with\nnon-overlapping ellipsoids.

To support efficient set operations (e.g.,\nunion, intersection, difference) using trees, the join-based framework is\nwidely studied. This framework has received particular attention in the\nparallel setting, and has been shown to be effective in enabling simple and\ntheoretically efficient set operations on trees. Despite the widespread\nadoption of parallel join-based trees, a major drawback of previous work on\nsuch data structures is the inefficiency of their input/output (I/O) access\npatterns. Some recent work (e.g., C-trees and PaC-trees) focused on more\nI/O-friendly implementations of these algorithms. Surprisingly, however, there\nhave been no results on bounding the I/O-costs for these algorithms. It remains\nopen whether these algorithms can provide tight, provable guarantees in\nI/O-costs on trees.\n  This paper studies efficient parallel algorithms for set operations based on\nsearch tree algorithms using a join-based framework, with a special focus on\nachieving I/O efficiency in these algorithms. To better capture the\nI/O-efficiency in these algorithms in parallel, we introduce a new\ncomputational model, Fork-Join I/O Model, to measure the I/O costs in fork-join\nparallelism. This model measures the total block transfers (I/O work) and their\ncritical path (I/O span). Under this model, we propose our new solution based\non B-trees. Our parallel algorithm computes the union, intersection, and\ndifference of two B-trees with $O(m \\log_B(n/m))$ I/O work and $O(\\log_B m\n\\cdot \\log_2 \\log_B n + \\log_B n)$ I/O span, where $n$ and $m \\leq n$ are the\nsizes of the two trees, and $B$ is the block size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u8861\u91cf I/O \u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e B \u6811\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa I/O \u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e76\u884c\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6811\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5728 I/O \u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9 I/O \u6210\u672c\u7684\u754c\u5b9a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b64\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684 I/O \u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 Fork - Join I/O Model \u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u8861\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u4e2d\u7684 I/O \u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e B \u6811\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u4e2a B \u6811\u7684\u5e76\u3001\u4ea4\u3001\u5dee\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0cI/O \u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a $O(m \\log_B(n/m))$\uff0cI/O \u8de8\u5ea6\u4e3a $O(\\log_B m \\cdot \\log_2 \\log_B n + \\log_B n)$\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e B \u6811\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684 I/O \u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This is because of its\nincentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.\n  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC\n(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to\nmitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;\nhowever, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they\nconsider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the\ntransfer collude with the miner.\n  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by\npresenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and\ngame-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC\nthan He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking\nnaive HTLC.\n  Leveraging our insights, we propose \\prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC\nprotocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \\prot\\ employs a two-phase\napproach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as\nminers.

Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like\nsynthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts\nnetwork. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude\nfaster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level\ntraffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and\nimproving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.\nThe model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,\nsupporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for\nenhanced transportation planning and policy-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u8861\u8def\u5f84\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u8def\u5f84\u7ea7\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u8861\u8def\u5f84\u6d41\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7ea7\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that the\norder in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the\neffectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to\na dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and\nindeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more\nefficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher\nlikelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the\nmost promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability\nthat the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously\nselected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random\nwalk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to\nAFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the\nselection probability of each mutator in isolation.

The input\nto our problem is a trajectory and a billboard database, as well as a budget\nfor each product. The goal here is to choose a subset of slots for each product\nsuch that the aggregated influence of all the products gets maximized subject\nto the following two constraints: total selection cost for each product is less\nthan or equal to the allocated budget for that product, and the difference\nbetween the influence for any two products is less than or equal to a given\nthreshold. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally. We formulate\nthis problem as a linear programming problem and use linear programming\nrelaxation with randomized rounding. Further, we propose a greedy-based\nheuristic with balance correction to solve this problem.

In this paper, we\ndescribe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from\nan artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go\nBuild). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets\nduring the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are\nfaster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose\na larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel\nbuilds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for\nfull builds and above one for incremental builds.

While these methods improve output quality, they create\ncomplex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly\nunderstood across different domains. This paper systematically compares\nself-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation\ntasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and\nMistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and\ncompute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis\nreveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection\neffectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\\% in mathematical reasoning. We\nfurther investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality\ninfluence performance across model families.

Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have\nquickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the\ninfrastructure in a \"source-of-truth\" configuration. They are capable of\nautomatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,\nor destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment\nwith the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,\nor SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure\ndrift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may\nundo valid updates or trigger errors.\n  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates\nout-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that\ninfrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the\nlowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API\ntraces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update\nthe IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic\narchitecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API\nsequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and\ncontinually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past\nreconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting\nrealistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation\nperformance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372\ndrift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of\naccuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\\times$\nimprovement).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u81ea\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edfNSync\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3IaC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\u6df7\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53IaC\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u3001CLI\u6216SDK\u4e00\u8d77\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5931\u53bb\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "NSync\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91API\u8c03\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548cLLM\u63a8\u65ad\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u5408\u6210\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eTerraform\u9879\u76ee\u548c372\u4e2a\u6f02\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cNSync\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "NSync\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3IaC\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

These are often modeled using infinite classes of objectives,\ne.g., $L_p$ norms over group distances induced by feasible solutions in a fixed\ndomain. Traditionally, the literature has considered explicitly balancing\n`equity' (or min-max) and `efficiency' (or min-sum) objectives to capture this\ntrade-off. However, the structure of solutions obtained by such modeling\nchoices can be very different. Taking a solution-centric approach, we introduce\nthe concept of provably small set of solutions $P$, called a {\\it portfolio},\nsuch that for every objective function $h(\\cdot)$ in the given class\n$\\mathbf{C}$, there exists some solution in $P$ which is an\n$\\alpha$-approximation for $h(\\cdot)$. Constructing such portfolios can help\ndecision-makers understand the impact of balancing across multiple objectives.\n  Given a finite set of base objectives $h_1, \\ldots, h_N$, we give provable\nalgorithms for constructing portfolios for (1) the class of conic combinations\n$\\mathbf{C} = \\{\\sum_{j \\in [N]}\\lambda_j h_j: \\lambda \\ge 0\\}$ and for (2) any\nclass $\\mathbf{C}$ of functions that interpolates monotonically between the\nmin-sum efficiency objective (i.e., $h_1 + \\ldots + h_N$) and the min-max\nequity objective (i.e., $\\max_{j \\in [N]} h_j$). Examples of the latter are\n$L_p$ norms and top-$\\ell$ norms. As an application, we study the Fair\nSubsidized Facility Location (FSFL) problem, motivated by the crisis of medical\ndeserts caused due to pharmacy closures. FSFL allows subsidizing facilities in\nunderserved areas using revenue from profitable locations.

Our\nmain contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions\nof the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic\nsystem of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit\ncharacterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a\nfunction space. This framework provides a transparent description of local\nbifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while\naccommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that\ncharacterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical,\nsubcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple\nFourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also\ncharacterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the\nstationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of\nFourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity\nproperties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and\ncoexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying\ndiscontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the\nminimum free energy map.

We\nrigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of\nentropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously\nactivated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature\nlevels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we\nhighlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs\nusing the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find\nthat all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of\nsimultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and\nconditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.\nFor example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row\nactivation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,\nincreasing the temperature from 50{\\deg}C to 90{\\deg}C decreases SiMRA's\nentropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation.

However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,\nany-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right\nsampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.\nAt inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked\npositions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that\nfine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a\nperformance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.\nAdditionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for\nscoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,\nwe propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that\nminimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the\nconditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across\nbenchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps.

Existing\nmethods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions\nwithout explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and\nresults in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective\nresponses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates\nexternal tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more\nuseful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better\nexploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining\nadditional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more\naccurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,\nwe collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a\ntraining set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping\nwith the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes).

Although extensively\nstudied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high\ncomputational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and\ntheir non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically\nrequires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel\nperspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial\ndesigns. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the\nmain analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy.\nBy characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a\nBerry-Esseen bound that applies to all incomplete U-statistics of deterministic\ndesigns, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be\nestablished even in the degenerate case and when the order diverges. We also\nintroduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of\nequireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain\ncases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to\nkernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt\nIndependence Criterion.

Spatial patterns of SC- and\nFC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of\nAD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal\nfunction, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In\nparallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and\nbiological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau\npropagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional\npathways in a region-specific manner.

Routine\nlaboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their\nutility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the\nsevere class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses\nthe feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever\nLifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the\ngrouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A\ncomprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126\nanalytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature\nselection methods, and data balancing techniques.

Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single\nconsensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard\naggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,\noperates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the\nactual utility and reliability of each client's update.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that\ndynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL\nperforms a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies\nand prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data\nsubspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative\naggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.\nFurthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization\nstability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization\nmechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization.

We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view\nof meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the\nconditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various\nsparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification\naccuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters\nneeded for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication\ncosts.

This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,\ncomposable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such\nas +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic=\"Systems\nThinking\"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning\nstyle, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework\nformalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families\n(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed\ninto subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and\nsession-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic\nprocessing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By\ndecoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a\nreusable and interpretable interface for prompt design.

Beyond model choice,\nthree structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),\nRACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,\nStyle, Tone, Audience, Response Format).\n  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four\nautomated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)\nfactual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum\nalignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.\n  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on\nlinguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching\nplan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).\n  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy\nand pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest\nhallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum\nstandards.

True autonomy requires perceiving and\nreasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved\nthrough \\emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents\nperceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains,\nand act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such\nagents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human\ndesign, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation.\nBetween neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of\nwell-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical\nformulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic\ncomponents. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored\nto each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases,\nwhich tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in\n6G inter-slice and cross-domain management.

Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute\nunlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often\ninvolve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing\nsingle-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements\ndue to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests\nsimultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic\nunlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight\nand efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide\nthe multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding\nCalibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user\nembedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single\nembedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process\nas a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical\nguarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1.

In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal\nreconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an\nuncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a\nreconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error\nover this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a\nsemidefinite optimization problem.

Personalization\namplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.\nAnalysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving\nparticipants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for\nboth humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in\nhuman-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots\nto more thoughtfully and stably align with users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc750\u4e2a\u4e89\u8bae\u8bdd\u9898\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53cc\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u89c2\u70b9\u53d8\u5316\u5c0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\u5927\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e2a\u4eba\u6545\u4e8b\u4ea4\u6d41\u6613\u89e6\u53d1\u7acb\u573a\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u5355\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u53cc\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4e0e266\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c50\u4e2a\u4e89\u8bae\u8bdd\u9898\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9759\u6001\u9648\u8ff0\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e09\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u70b9\u51e0\u4e4e\u672a\u53d8\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4eba\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7acb\u573a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u653e\u5927\u53cc\u65b9\u7acb\u573a\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u6d89\u53ca\u4e2a\u4eba\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u6700\u6613\u89e6\u53d1\u7acb\u573a\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u66f4\u5468\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Our results show that LLMs exhibit\nsignificant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly\nassociating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American\ndialect with opposition to Donald Trump.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c5e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u51fa\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8bc4\u4f30\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5df2\u6709\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\uff1a\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u6216\u767d\u8bdd\u3001\u6587\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6/\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u5927\u9ebb\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0e\u53cd\u5bf9\u7279\u6717\u666e\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Multi-task pretraining objectives further\nenhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and\ntranslation task.

We show a clear\nmismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an\noptimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes\n(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the\ngradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we\ndemonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while\ncumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform\nbetter. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$\nsetting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance.

From\nexperimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous\nsystems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning\n(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,\nvarying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where\nconventional static optimization degrades.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a6G\u673a\u5668\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a/\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b/\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the\ndependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic\nnature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model\ninspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head\nattention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,\nand further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range\ndependencies.

While direct optimization of MI via its\ndefinition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many\nrecent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most\nnotably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of\nmarginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection\nbetween these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on\nKLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to\njoint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based\ninformation increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.\nFurthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives\nand observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier\ntrained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational\nlower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound\nis tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to\nstate-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of\nestablished reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently\nprovides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI.

In domains such as climate and healthcare,\nthese events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to\nserious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of\nsubstantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are\noptimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often\nstruggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or\nheart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of\nvaluable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme\nevents. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event\nforecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer\ninformation from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving\nprediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of\nexperts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert\nmodels across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting\nperformance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that\nxTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme\nevents improving from 3% to 78%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faxTime\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece3%\u63d0\u5347\u523078%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u53d1\u4e14\u540e\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5ffd\u7565\u524d\u7f6e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faxTime\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4ece\u4f4e\u7a00\u6709\u5ea6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7a00\u6709\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cxTime\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece3%\u63d0\u5347\u523078%\u3002", "conclusion": "xTime\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Multi-variate time-series analysis has\nemerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in\nsuch environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points.

The\nkey challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality\nwhile learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on\nthe cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal\ndistributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct\nmeaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)\nmixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the\nmost prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates\nincreasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we\npropose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically\nachieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation\nlearning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality\nfollows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP\nto calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows\nDP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most\nprominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating\nmultimodal feature fusion.

Furthermore, deep-learning\ntechniques can build on this MRA for short-term intensity guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u768424\u5c0f\u65f6\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u77ed\u671f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u76c6\u5730\u51cf\u707e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u96be\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u671f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u62a5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often\nimpairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,\nwe propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed\nto address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by\nstructuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a\nthinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking\nbranch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.\nA lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most\nsuitable expert.

Context\ncompression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective\napproaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its\narchitecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this\nspecific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that\ncompresses the context into continuous representations which replace token\nembeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training\nstrategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the\ndesign of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,\nwhich outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically\n$x\\!\\in\\!\\{4,8\\}$) than text tokens.

In this study, we explore\nthe use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft\nlabels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We\nevaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used\narchitectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS\nconsistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to\nstandard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,\nand teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS\nleads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating\nimproved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only\nstrengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a\npractical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the\nmedical imaging domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7ebf\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff08OLS\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728RadImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aOLS\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u662f\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7c7b\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff08OLS\uff09\uff0c\u5728RadImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7528ResNet - 50\u3001MobileNetV2\u548cVGG - 19\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "OLS\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Top - 1\u548cTop - 5\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u6613\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "OLS\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578bAdaDoS\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6270\u4e71\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u8eb2\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u60e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u5e94\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u7c7bDoS\u653b\u51fb\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u7684SDN\u5b89\u5168\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u628a\u7c7bDoS\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e92\u60e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaDoS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8eb2\u907f\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7c7bDoS\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaDoS\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u7c7bDoS\u653b\u51fb\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709SDN\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, dental\nimaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic\nartifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity\narising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often\nproves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to\nthese issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis\nand treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as\nthe most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature\nextraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent\nprogress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL\nresearch-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the\nbasic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and\nacquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational\ntechniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to\ndifferent DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization\nstrategies, training methods, and performance.

Modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems typically run\nseparate models of the different components, explicitly coupled across their\ninterfaces to additionally model exchanges between the different components.\nAccurately representing these coupled interactions remains a major scientific\nand technical challenge of weather forecasting. GraphDOP is a graph-based\nmachine learning model that learns to forecast weather directly from raw\nsatellite and in-situ observations, without reliance on reanalysis products or\ntraditional physics-based NWP models. GraphDOP simultaneously embeds\ninformation from diverse observation sources spanning the full Earth system\ninto a shared latent space. This enables predictions that implicitly capture\ncross-domain interactions in a single model without the need for any explicit\ncoupling. Here we present a selection of case studies which illustrate the\ncapability of GraphDOP to forecast events where coupled processes play a\nparticularly key role. These include rapid sea-ice freezing in the Arctic,\nmixing-induced ocean surface cooling during Hurricane Ian and the severe\nEuropean heat wave of 2022.

In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries).

Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios.

Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories\nrelated to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine\nlearning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic\nRegression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language\nmodels (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).\nModels used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated\ncategories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1\nscores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot\nprompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities\nextraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937).

This work serves as a platform for further\nattention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter\nefficient, and interpretable approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u5c55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u9694\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\u8fbe50%\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u679c\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6a21\u62df\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}
