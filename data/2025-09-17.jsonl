However,\nmodern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands\nsemantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given\nenormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)\ndemonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to\nunacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \\textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel\nsystem that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline\nrepresentation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline\nphase, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations\nfor each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model\non these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only\nthe ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,\n\\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant\nefficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy\nmodel to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade\nmechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific\naccuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that\n\\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces\nexpensive LLM invocations by up to 85\\%, making large-scale semantic analysis\npractical and efficient."}

The internal microstructure of a 3D printed component\ncan have a significant impact on its mechanical, vibrational, and shock\nproperties and allows for a richer design space when this is controllable. Due\nto the complex interactions of the internal geometry of an extrusion-based AM\ncomponent, it is common practice to assume a homogeneous behavior or to perform\ncharacterization testing on the specific toolpath configurations. To avoid\nunnecessary testing or material waste, it is necessary to develop an accurate\nand consistent numerical simulation framework with relevant boundary value\nproblems that can handle the complicated geometry of internal material\nmicrostructure present in AM components.

This study conducts a systematic empirical\nassessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java,\nPython, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and\nCodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two\nprompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt\nlanguages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language\npairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across\nmodels and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by\n13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging\npairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM\noutperforms TransCoder across the benchmark.

To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced\ncontinual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers\nwhat matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential\nPrivacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the\nsemantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for\nprivate entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general\nknowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This\nmodule leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to\nintelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and\nparameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge\ncrucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that\nPeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,\noutperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks\nwhile ensuring robust privacy."}

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that\nexplicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.\nStemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates\nfeature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share\nsimilar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that\nour proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally\nheterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size.

METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities.

The\nconventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such\na PPF problem are associated with this topology. A change in the topology might\nalter the power flow patterns and thus require the PPF problem to be solved\nagain. The previous PPF model and its solutions are no longer valid for the new\ntopology. This practice incurs both inconvenience and computation burdens as\nmore contingencies are foreseen due to high renewables and a large share of\nelectric vehicles. This paper presents a novel topology-adaptive approach,\nbased on the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), for finding the solutions to PPF\nproblems under varying N-1 topologies, particularly with one-line failures. By\nleveraging context set-based topology representation and conditional\ndistribution over function learning techniques, the proposed MMNP enhances the\nrobustness of PPF models to topology variations, mitigating the need for\nretraining PPF models on a new configuration.

SIRENs Sitzmann\net al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting\nsignals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the\nnetwork's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral\nbottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero\noutput and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its\nrepresentational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight\nInitialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly\ninitialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are\nadaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to\nrandom Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without\nintroducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape\nfitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new\navenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep\nneural network training.

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness."}

RadGame addresses this gap\nby combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,\nAI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.\nIn RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which\nare automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public\ndatasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for\nuser missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest\nX-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on\nradiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared\nto a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing\na final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants\nusing RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to\n17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing\naccuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.\nRadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,\nfeedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI\nresources in education."}

We propose techniques to generate realistic\npositive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as\nsamplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data\naugmentation methods.\n  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884\ninstruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are\ncompetitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The\nsecond experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of\ninstruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework\noutperforms related works, achieving 81.7\\% top-1 and 95.7\\% top-5 accuracies\nfor three-instrument mixtures."}
