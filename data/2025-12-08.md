### [1] [Documenting SME Processes with Conversational AI: From Tacit Knowledge to BPMN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05122)
*Unnikrishnan Radhakrishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍由大语言模型驱动的对话式助手，将车间隐性知识转化为BPMN 2.0图，概念验证评估显示其有效，分析相关问题并给出部署路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小企业严重依赖隐性经验知识，缺乏正式文档，需工具将其转化为标准流程文档。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro驱动对话式助手，通过轻量级Gradio前端和bpmn - js可视化，以访谈式对话获取流程细节并生成实时图表。

Result: 在设备维护场景概念验证评估中，助手约12分钟生成准确“AS - IS”模型、标注问题并生成“TO - BE”变体，且API成本符合中小企业预算。

Conclusion: 对话式大语言模型可降低严格流程文档的技能和成本门槛，助中小企业保存知识、提升运营透明度和加速持续改进。

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still depend heavily on tacit, experience-based know-how that rarely makes its way into formal documentation. This paper introduces a large-language-model (LLM)-driven conversational assistant that captures such knowledge on the shop floor and converts it incrementally and interactively into standards-compliant Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 diagrams. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate "AS-IS" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved "TO-BE" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts.

### [2] [Semantic Faithfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出两个无监督指标评估大语言模型忠实度，用信息论和热力学方法，在公司文件总结任务验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型对给定任务的忠实度是复杂挑战，需新评估指标。

Method: 将大语言模型视为二分信息引擎，用信息论和热力学方法，通过凸优化推断矩阵，提出语义忠实度（SF）和基于热力学的语义熵产生（SEP）指标。

Result: SF指标通过矩阵间KL散度量化忠实度，SEP指标显示高忠实度通常意味着低熵产生，两指标可联合或单独用于评估和幻觉控制。

Conclusion: 提出的SF和SEP指标可用于大语言模型评估和幻觉控制，在公司SEC 10 - K文件总结任务得到验证。

Abstract: Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.

### [4] [On the Computability of Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05212)
*Georgios Mappouras,Charalambos Rossides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨人工智能发展与通用人工智能界限，证明算法无法展现初始算法中不存在的新功能能力，最后讨论了相关影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能发展，人们关注通用人工智能实现程度，本文旨在确定任何机器可计算过程的上限。

Method: 借用前人对通用人工智能的定义，基于此对计算极限划定新界限并进行形式化证明。

Result: 证明没有算法能展现初始算法中不存在的新功能能力，人工智能模型只能展示现有功能能力及其组合。

Conclusion: 讨论了证明结果对人工智能未来发展和人类智能起源的影响。

Abstract: In recent years we observed rapid and significant advancements in artificial intelligence (A.I.). So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.

### [5] [Resolving Zadehs Paradox Axiomatic Possibility Theory as a Foundation for Reliable Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05257)
*Bychkov Oleksii,Bychkova Sophia,Lytvynchuk Khrystyna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文认为危机解决之道在于可能性理论，通过对比分析三种范式，以医疗诊断为例展示其能解决DST悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明可能性理论不仅是替代方案，还能从根本上解决DST悖论。

Method: 采用对比分析三种范式（概率、证据、可能性），以经典医疗诊断困境为例。

Result: 展示了可能性理论能正确处理矛盾数据，避免DST逻辑陷阱，使形式推理更接近自然智能逻辑。

Conclusion: 可能性理论可解决DST悖论，为处理不确定性提供逻辑一致和数学严谨的基础。

Abstract: This work advances and substantiates the thesis that the resolution of this crisis lies in the domain of possibility theory, specifically in the axiomatic approach developed in Bychkovs article. Unlike numerous attempts to fix Dempster rule, this approach builds from scratch a logically consistent and mathematically rigorous foundation for working with uncertainty, using the dualistic apparatus of possibility and necessity measures. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that possibility theory is not merely an alternative, but provides a fundamental resolution to DST paradoxes. A comparative analysis of three paradigms will be conducted probabilistic, evidential, and possibilistic. Using a classic medical diagnostic dilemma as an example, it will be shown how possibility theory allows for correct processing of contradictory data, avoiding the logical traps of DST and bringing formal reasoning closer to the logic of natural intelligence.

### [6] [AI & Human Co-Improvement for Safer Co-Superintelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05356)
*Jason Weston,Jakob Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 自改进有危险且耗时，人类更可行目标是最大化人机协同改进以实现共同超级智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指出AI自改进存在危险且难以快速实现，需寻找更可行目标。

Method: 聚焦于提升AI系统与人类研究人员合作进行AI研究的能力，将人类研究改进纳入循环。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 关注人类研究改进可更快、更安全地实现目标。

Abstract: Self-improvement is a goal currently exciting the field of AI, but is fraught with danger, and may take time to fully achieve. We advocate that a more achievable and better goal for humanity is to maximize co-improvement: collaboration between human researchers and AIs to achieve co-superintelligence. That is, specifically targeting improving AI systems' ability to work with human researchers to conduct AI research together, from ideation to experimentation, in order to both accelerate AI research and to generally endow both AIs and humans with safer superintelligence through their symbiosis. Focusing on including human research improvement in the loop will both get us there faster, and more safely.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章介绍结合MCP与临床应用的MCP - AI架构，它支持自适应、纵向和协作推理，通过两个用例验证，为临床环境提供可扩展的AI基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统难以将上下文推理、长期状态管理和人类可验证工作流整合，且医疗系统愈发复杂，急需自主的、上下文感知的临床推理框架。

Method: 提出基于MCP的MCP - AI架构，MCP文件捕捉临床目标等信息形成可复用和可审计的内存对象。

Result: 通过两个用例验证，MCP - AI能促进医生参与验证、简化临床流程，确保AI责任在医疗提供者间安全转移，且符合监管标准。

Conclusion: MCP - AI为未来临床环境中的可解释、可组合和安全导向的AI提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: Healthcare AI systems have historically faced challenges in merging contextual reasoning, long-term state management, and human-verifiable workflows into a cohesive framework. This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines. MCP-AI provides a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI within upcoming clinical environments.

*Changwen Xing,SamZaak Wong,Xinlai Wan,Yanfeng Lu,Mengli Zhang,Zebin Ma,Lei Qi,Zhengxiong Li,Nan Guan,Zhe Jiang,Xi Wang,Jun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出针对长集成电路规格的知识图谱增强推理框架ChipMind，在工业规模基准测试中表现优于现有基线，弥合学术研究与工业应用差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在集成电路开发自动化中受限于上下文窗口，现有上下文扩展方法难以对复杂电路规格进行有效语义建模和多跳推理。

Method: 先通过电路语义感知知识图谱构建方法将电路规格转换为领域特定知识图谱ChipKG，再利用ChipKG增强推理机制，结合信息论自适应检索和意图感知语义过滤。

Result: 在工业规模规格推理基准测试中显著优于现有基线，平均提升34.59%（最高达72.73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了大语言模型辅助硬件设计学术研究与实际工业部署的关键差距。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate immense potential for automating integrated circuit (IC) development, their practical deployment is fundamentally limited by restricted context windows. Existing context-extension methods struggle to achieve effective semantic modeling and thorough multi-hop reasoning over extensive, intricate circuit specifications. To address this, we introduce ChipMind, a novel knowledge graph-augmented reasoning framework specifically designed for lengthy IC specifications. ChipMind first transforms circuit specifications into a domain-specific knowledge graph ChipKG through the Circuit Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Construction methodology. It then leverages the ChipKG-Augmented Reasoning mechanism, combining information-theoretic adaptive retrieval to dynamically trace logical dependencies with intent-aware semantic filtering to prune irrelevant noise, effectively balancing retrieval completeness and precision. Evaluated on an industrial-scale specification reasoning benchmark, ChipMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 34.59% (up to 72.73%). Our framework bridges a critical gap between academic research and practical industrial deployment of LLM-aided Hardware Design (LAD).

### [9] [BEAVER: An Efficient Deterministic LLM Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05439)
*Tarun Suresh,Nalin Wadhwa,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BEAVER框架用于计算大语言模型约束满足的确定性、合理概率界限，评估效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型从研究原型过渡到生产系统，需要可靠方法验证模型输出是否满足约束，而采样估计无可靠保证。

Method: 提出BEAVER框架，针对前缀封闭语义约束，使用新颖的令牌树和前沿数据结构系统探索生成空间，每次迭代保持合理界限，还对验证问题进行形式化并证明方法合理性。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，BEAVER比基线方法实现了6到8倍更严格的概率界限，识别出3到4倍更多的高风险实例。

Conclusion: BEAVER能实现松散界限或实证评估无法提供的精确表征和风险评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from research prototypes to production systems, practitioners often need reliable methods to verify that model outputs satisfy required constraints. While sampling-based estimates provide an intuition of model behavior, they offer no sound guarantees. We present BEAVER, the first practical framework for computing deterministic, sound probability bounds on LLM constraint satisfaction. Given any prefix-closed semantic constraint, BEAVER systematically explores the generation space using novel token trie and frontier data structures, maintaining provably sound bounds at every iteration. We formalize the verification problem, prove soundness of our approach, and evaluate BEAVER on correctness verification, privacy verification and secure code generation tasks across multiple state of the art LLMs. BEAVER achieves 6 to 8 times tighter probability bounds and identifies 3 to 4 times more high risk instances compared to baseline methods under identical computational budgets, enabling precise characterization and risk assessment that loose bounds or empirical evaluation cannot provide.

### [10] [The Seeds of Scheming: Weakness of Will in the Building Blocks of Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05449)
*Robert Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出akrasia概念分析AI系统不一致性，引入Akrasia Benchmark进行衡量，并探讨多智能体系统中的问题，连接多学科。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型存在的知道正确答案却不按此行动的不一致问题，为分析AI系统的不一致性和目标漂移提供基础概念。

Method: 提出akrasia概念，引入Akrasia Benchmark，通过一系列提示条件测量模型局部响应与先前承诺的矛盾。

Result: 可对不同模型家族、解码策略和诱惑类型的“自我控制”进行定量比较，还能探讨多智能体系统中微观层面akrasia导致宏观不稳定的情况。

Conclusion: 将不一致性重新定义为意志软弱，连接了智能体行为与经典行为理论，为哲学、心理学和智能体AI科学搭建了实证桥梁。

Abstract: Large language models display a peculiar form of inconsistency: they "know" the correct answer but fail to act on it. In human philosophy, this tension between global judgment and local impulse is called akrasia, or weakness of will. We propose akrasia as a foundational concept for analyzing inconsistency and goal drift in agentic AI systems. To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of "self-control" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as "scheming" or deliberate misalignment. By reframing inconsistency as weakness of will, this work connects agentic behavior to classical theories of agency and provides an empirical bridge between philosophy, psychology, and the emerging science of agentic AI.

*Chuang Yu,Jinmiao Zhao,Mingxuan Zhao,Yunpeng Liu,Xiujun Shu,Yuanhao Feng,Bo Wang,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出MIND推理框架解决多模态大语言模型在推理任务中的问题，在多数据集达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在多依据语义建模有限、逻辑鲁棒性不足、复杂场景易被误导的问题。

Method: 提出MIND推理框架，包括RAD范式扩展数据集、P2CL策略进行两阶段学习、MCA优化策略缓解语义空间表征纠缠。

Result: 在多个涵盖科学、常识和数学场景的公开数据集上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 为推动多模态大语言模型向更高水平的认知智能发展提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied to reasoning tasks. However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of "Understand -> Rethink -> Correct", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/MIND

*Ting-Ting Xie,Yixin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Executor - Analyst框架解决小型大语言模型在临床应用中的推理缺陷，采用分层集成策略提高性能，揭示扩展上下文和工具集的关键见解，无需微调实现先进成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于小型大语言模型的临床代理如TxAgent存在上下文利用失败问题，模型能检索生物医学证据但无法将诊断基于这些信息。

Method: 提出Executor - Analyst框架，将工具执行的句法精度与临床推理的语义鲁棒性分离，通过协调专门的TxAgents（执行器）和长上下文基础模型（分析器）；采用分层集成策略，通过压力测试揭示关键见解。

Result: 分层集成策略显著优于全局池化，解决信息瓶颈；发现上下文 - 性能悖论和动作空间的维度诅咒现象；在CURE - Bench上无需昂贵的端到端微调实现了先进性能。

Conclusion: 训练免的架构工程在临床代理中有潜力，为下一代值得信赖的人工智能驱动治疗方法提供可扩展、灵活的基础。

Abstract: Current clinical agent built on small LLMs, such as TxAgent suffer from a \textit{Context Utilization Failure}, where models successfully retrieve biomedical evidence due to supervised finetuning but fail to ground their diagnosis in that information. In this work, we propose the Executor-Analyst Framework, a modular architecture that decouples the syntactic precision of tool execution from the semantic robustness of clinical reasoning. By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies. Crucially, our approach underscores the potential of training-free architectural engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CURE-Bench without the need for expensive end-to-end finetuning. This provides a scalable, agile foundation for the next generation of trustworthy AI-driven therapeutics. Code has been released on https://github.com/June01/CureAgent.

TL;DR: 本文引入OntoAxiom基准测试大语言模型识别本体公理的能力，评估不同策略。结果显示逐公理提示F1分数更高，性能因公理和领域而异，大模型表现更好，虽不能完全自动化但可为工程师提供候选公理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体开发需专业知识，本体学习有进展，本文聚焦识别本体中定义逻辑关系的公理这一挑战。

Method: 引入OntoAxiom基准，含九个本体、17118个三元组和2771个公理，聚焦多种公理类型。用两种提示策略测试12个大语言模型在三种样本设置下的性能。

Result: 逐公理提示比直接提示F1分数高；性能因公理而异；领域影响性能；大模型表现优于小模型。

Conclusion: 虽整体性能不足以完全自动化公理识别，但大语言模型可为本体工程师提供有价值的候选公理，辅助本体开发和完善。

Abstract: Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.

TL;DR: 提出新的子句加权方案和抽取方法，开发新SLS求解器DeepDist，实验显示其性能优于现有求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解（W）PMS的SLS算法未能充分区分PMS和WPMS，忽略两者结构差异。

Method: 提出新子句加权方案，按不同条件更新PMS和WPMS实例的子句权重，引入新初始化方法；提出抽取方法优先满足单元和硬子句；开发新求解器DeepDist。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，代码可在https://github.com/jmhmaxsat/DeepDist获取。

Abstract: Partial Maximum Satisfiability (PMS) and Weighted Partial Maximum Satisfiability (WPMS) generalize Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), with broad real-world applications. Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes. However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types. Furthermore, we propose a decimation method that prioritizes satisfying unit and hard clauses, effectively complementing our proposed clause weighting scheme. Building on these methods, we develop a new SLS solver for (W)PMS named DeepDist. Experimental results on benchmarks from the anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations show that DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers. Notably, a hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners, SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型单纯依赖限价订单簿快照，希望结合市场和代理层面信息，更有效捕捉与执行可能性相关的模式，准确预测限价单成交时间。

Method: 将扩张因果卷积网络与Transformer编码器结合，并通过Kolmogorov - Arnold网络增强，整合代理行动和订单队列位置信息；使用标注的CAC 40指数期货数据评估模型；用SHAP分析特征重要性。

Result: KANFormer在校准和区分方面均优于现有工作；通过SHAP分析了特征重要性。

Conclusion: 结合丰富的市场信号和富有表现力的神经架构可实现对成交概率的准确和可解释预测。

Abstract: This paper introduces KANFormer, a novel deep-learning-based model for predicting the time-to-fill of limit orders by leveraging both market- and agent-level information. KANFormer combines a Dilated Causal Convolutional network with a Transformer encoder, enhanced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which improve nonlinear approximation. Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC). We further analyze feature importance over time using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Our results highlight the benefits of combining rich market signals with expressive neural architectures to achieve accurate and interpretabl predictions of fill probabilities.

Conclusion: FARDA有效解决了现有方法的缺点，各组件有其必要性。

Abstract: The fast deployment of cognitive radar to counter jamming remains a critical challenge in modern warfare, where more efficient deployment leads to quicker detection of targets. Existing methods are primarily based on evolutionary algorithms, which are time-consuming and prone to falling into local optima. We tackle these drawbacks via the efficient inference of neural networks and propose a brand new framework: Fast Anti-Jamming Radar Deployment Algorithm (FARDA). We first model the radar deployment problem as an end-to-end task and design deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve it, where we develop integrated neural modules to perceive heatmap information and a brand new reward format. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves coverage comparable to evolutionary algorithms while deploying radars approximately 7,000 times faster. Further ablation experiments confirm the necessity of each component of FARDA.

Abstract: Machine intelligence marks the ultimate dream of making machines' intelligence comparable to human beings. While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

Result: 将常见反对观点重新定义为可测试的协调失败问题。

Conclusion: 通用人工智能的发展要依靠大语言模型，而非绕过它。

Abstract: Influential critiques argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) are a dead end for AGI: "mere pattern matchers" structurally incapable of reasoning or planning. We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while "reasoning" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory). By reframing common objections as testable coordination failures, we argue that the path to AGI runs through LLMs, not around them.

Method: 引入多模态肿瘤智能体MOA，结合基于TITAN模型的组织学工具和对临床、基因组输入的推理，在TCGA - LGG队列488例患者上评估。

Result: 无组织学工具的MOA F1分数0.826超临床基线，融合组织学特征后F1分数达0.912，超组织学基线和融合基线。

Conclusion: MOA能捕捉补充信息，实现准确的IDH1突变预测。

Abstract: Low-grade gliomas frequently present IDH1 mutations that define clinically distinct subgroups with specific prognostic and therapeutic implications. This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) integrating a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma, combined with reasoning over structured clinical and genomic inputs through PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction.

Abstract: Recent advances in psychotherapy have focused on treatment personalization, such as by selecting treatment modules based on personalized networks. However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training. Future research should examine whether these networks improve treatment outcomes relative to other methods of treatment personalization, including statistically estimated networks.

Abstract: How many mistakes do published AI papers contain? Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge.

Result: 通过对现有视觉语言模型进行评估，揭示其在科学推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: PRiSM能让人们更深入了解视觉语言模型的科学推理能力。

Abstract: Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in scientific domains like mathematics and physics poses unique challenges that go far beyond predicting final answers. These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.

Result: 辅助推理集的一致性与最终答案正确性相关，能找出推理失败步骤，可定义置信区域。

Conclusion: TRACE框架能为模型改进提供可操作信号，支持过滤、调试和模型优化。

Abstract: Reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning remains an open challenge for large vision-language models. Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.

Motivation: 传统DRL方法因经典函数逼近器限制表示能力，资源分配问题NP难，需更好方法。

Method: 将环拓扑变分量子电路与Rainbow DQN集成得到VQR - DQN，把HRAP建模为带组合动作空间的MDP。

Result: 在四个HRAP基准测试中，VQR - DQN比随机基线归一化工期减少26.8%，比Double DQN和经典Rainbow DQN性能高4.9 - 13.4%。

Conclusion: 量子增强DRL在大规模资源分配中有潜力，代码开源。

Abstract: Resource allocation remains NP-hard due to combinatorial complexity. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, such as the Rainbow Deep Q-Network (DQN), improve scalability through prioritized replay and distributional heads, classical function approximators limit their representational power. We introduce Variational Quantum Rainbow DQN (VQR-DQN), which integrates ring-topology variational quantum circuits with Rainbow DQN to leverage quantum superposition and entanglement. We frame the human resource allocation problem (HRAP) as a Markov decision process (MDP) with combinatorial action spaces based on officer capabilities, event schedules, and transition times. On four HRAP benchmarks, VQR-DQN achieves 26.8% normalized makespan reduction versus random baselines and outperforms Double DQN and classical Rainbow DQN by 4.9-13.4%. These gains align with theoretical connections between circuit expressibility, entanglement, and policy quality, demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced DRL for large-scale resource allocation.

Abstract: We introduce, a large-scale synthetic benchmark of 15,045 university-level physics problems (90/10% train/test split). Each problem is fully parameterized, supporting an effectively infinite range of input configurations, and is accompanied by structured, step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code that produces the ground-truth solution for any parameter set. The benchmark contains three question types: MC-Symbolic (multiple-choice with symbolic options), MC-Numerical (multiple-choice with numerical options), and free-form (open-ended responses). These diverse formats test complementary reasoning skills. By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models reveal both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning, positioning SymPyBench as a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems

Result: Zypher 7B 模型表现最佳，能持续制定最大化投资回报且风险调整结果更好的策略。

Conclusion: GenAI 大幅提升投资表现，为资产管理专业人士创建更好解决方案奠定基础。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has enormous potential for improving two critical areas in investing, namely portfolio optimization (choosing the best combination of assets) and risk management (protecting those investments). Our study works at this intersection, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to upgrade how financial decisions are traditionally made. This research specifically tested how well advanced LLMs like Microsoft Phi 2, Mistral 7B, and Zypher 7B can create practical, risk-aware strategies for investing mutual funds in different sectors of the economy. Our method is sophisticated: it combines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which enables the LLM to check external, real-time data with standard financial optimization methods. The model's advice is context-aware because we feed it large economic signals, like changes in the global economy. The Zypher 7B model was the clear winner. It consistently produced strategies that maximized investment returns while delivering better risk-adjusted results than the other models. Its ability to process complex relationships and contextual information makes it a highly powerful tool for financial allocation. In conclusion, our findings show that GenAI substantially improves performance over basic allocation methods. By connecting GenAI to real-world financial applications, this work lays the groundwork for creating smarter, more efficient, and more adaptable solutions for asset management professionals.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLMs）的语义连接方法成本高，基于嵌入的语义相似性过滤候选对的方法收益有限，语义相似性不能可靠预测连接结果。

Method: 提出FDJ方法，自动提取特征并组合成合取范式的逻辑表达式（特征分解），以有效剔除不匹配的对；利用LLMs自动提取可靠特征并组成逻辑表达式，同时对输出结果提供统计保证。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，与现有技术相比，成本最多降低10倍，且保证相同的质量。

Conclusion: FDJ方法能在保证质量的前提下显著降低语义连接的成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used within data systems to process large datasets with text fields. A broad class of such tasks involves a semantic join-joining two tables based on a natural language predicate per pair of tuples, evaluated using an LLM. Semantic joins generalize tasks such as entity matching and record categorization, as well as more complex text understanding tasks. A naive implementation is expensive as it requires invoking an LLM for every pair of rows in the cross product. Existing approaches mitigate this cost by first applying embedding-based semantic similarity to filter candidate pairs, deferring to an LLM only when similarity scores are deemed inconclusive. However, these methods yield limited gains in practice, since semantic similarity may not reliably predict the join outcome. We propose Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ for short), a novel approach for performing semantic joins that significantly reduces cost while preserving quality. FDJ automatically extracts features and combines them into a logical expression in conjunctive normal form that we call a featurized decomposition to effectively prune out non-matching pairs. A featurized decomposition extracts key information from text records and performs inexpensive comparisons on the extracted features. We show how to use LLMs to automatically extract reliable features and compose them into logical expressions while providing statistical guarantees on the output result-an inherently challenging problem due to dependencies among features. Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 10 times reduction in cost compared with the state-of-the-art while providing the same quality guarantees.

Conclusion: PETGraph在属性演化时间图的数据管理和查询处理上表现更优，能有效解决现有方案存在的问题。

Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose nodes and edges, together with their associated properties, continuously change over time. With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, a subclass of the temporal graph, i.e., Property Evolution Temporal Graph, in which the value of properties on nodes or edges changes frequently while the graph's topology barely changes, is growing rapidly. However, existing temporal graph management solutions are not oriented to the Property Evolution Temporal Graph data, which leads to highly complex data modeling and low-performance query processing of temporal graph queries. To solve these problems, we developed PETGraph, a data management system for Property Evolution Temporal Graph data. PETGraph adopts a valid-time temporal property graph data model to facilitate data modeling, supporting ACID features with transactions. To improve temporal graph query performance, we designed a space-efficient temporal property storage and a fine-granularity multi-level locking mechanism. Experimental results show that PETGraph requires, on average, only 33% of the storage space needed by the current best data management solution. Additionally, it achieves an average of 58.8 times higher transaction throughput in HTAP workloads compared to the best current solutions and outperforms them by an average of 267 times in query latency.

Motivation: 大语言模型资源和能耗高，虽易用但简单任务下小模型也有类似性能，需降低成本和能耗。

Method: 提出JITR，利用模型搜索和迁移学习识别和微调适合重复任务的模型。

Result: 使用JITR原型Poodle在示例任务上实现显著节省。

Conclusion: JITR保留大语言模型易用性和低开发成本优点，能节省大量成本和能源。

Abstract: Businesses increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to automate simple repetitive tasks instead of developing custom machine learning models. LLMs require few, if any, training examples and can be utilized by users without expertise in model development. However, this comes at the cost of substantially higher resource and energy consumption compared to smaller models, which often achieve similar predictive performance for simple tasks. In this paper, we present our vision for just-in-time model replacement (JITR), where, upon identifying a recurring task in calls to an LLM, the model is replaced transparently with a cheaper alternative that performs well for this specific task. JITR retains the ease of use and low development effort of LLMs, while saving significant cost and energy. We discuss the main challenges in realizing our vision regarding the identification of recurring tasks and the creation of a custom model. Specifically, we argue that model search and transfer learning will play a crucial role in JITR to efficiently identify and fine-tune models for a recurring task. Using our JITR prototype Poodle, we achieve significant savings for exemplary tasks.

TL;DR: 提出FedGMR解决异构环境下带宽受限客户端参与联邦学习的问题，实验表明其在高异构和非IID设置下收敛快、精度高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构环境中，带宽受限客户端因通信能力有限难以有效参与联邦学习，其小模型后期参数不足，导致收敛慢、泛化能力下降。

Method: 提出FedGMR，在训练中逐步增加客户端子模型密度，开发适用于异步模型异构联邦学习的掩码感知聚合规则并给出收敛保证。

Result: 在FEMNIST、CIFAR - 10和ImageNet - 100上的大量实验表明，FedGMR收敛更快、精度更高。

Conclusion: FedGMR能有效解决异构环境下带宽受限客户端参与联邦学习的问题，尤其在高异构和非IID设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) holds strong potential for distributed machine learning, but in heterogeneous environments, Bandwidth-Constrained Clients (BCCs) often struggle to participate effectively due to limited communication capacity. Their small sub-models learn quickly at first but become under-parameterized in later stages, leading to slow convergence and degraded generalization. We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL. Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate that FedGMR achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially under high heterogeneity and non-IID settings.

Abstract: Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a sequence $s_1$ of $n$ letters drawn i.i.d. from an alphabet of size $σ$ and a mutated substring $s_2$ of length $m < n$, we often want to recover the mutation history that generated $s_2$ from $s_1$. Modern sequence aligners are widely used for this task, and many employ the seed-chain-extend heuristic with $k$-mer seeds. Previously, Shaw and Yu showed that optimal linear-gap cost chaining can produce a chain with $1 - O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\right)$ recoverability, the proportion of the mutation history that is recovered, in $O\left(mn^{2.43θ} \log n\right)$ expected time, where $θ< 0.206$ is the mutation rate under a substitution-only channel and $s_1$ is assumed to be uniformly random. However, a gap remains between theory and practice, since real genomic data includes insertions and deletions (indels), and yet seed-chain-extend remains effective. In this paper, we generalize those prior results by introducing mathematical machinery to deal with the two new obstacles introduced by indel channels: the dependence of neighboring anchors and the presence of anchors that are only partially correct. We are thus able
  to prove that the expected recoverability of an optimal chain is $\ge 1 - O\Bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\Bigr)$ and the expected runtime is $O(mn^{3.15 \cdot θ_T}\log n)$, when the total mutation rate given by the sum of the substitution, insertion, and deletion mutation rates ($θ_T = θ_i + θ_d + θ_s$) is less than $0.159$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give almost-linear-time algorithms for approximating rooted minimum cut and maximum arborescence packing in directed graphs, two problems that are dual to each other [Edm73]. More specifically, for an $n$-vertex, $m$-edge directed graph $G$ whose $s$-rooted minimum cut value is $k$, our first algorithm computes an $s$-rooted cut of size at most $O(k\log^{5} n)$ in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time, and our second algorithm packs $k$ $s$-rooted arborescences with $n^{o(1)}$ congestion in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time, certifying that the $s$-rooted minimum cut is at least $k / n^{o(1)}$. Our first algorithm also works for weighted graphs.
  Prior to our work, the fastest algorithms for computing the $s$-rooted minimum cut were exact but had super-linear running time: either $\tilde{O}(mk)$ [Gab91] or $\tilde{O}(m^{1+o(1)}\min\{\sqrt{n},n/m^{1/3}\})$ [CLN+22]. The fastest known algorithms for packing $s$-rooted arborescences had no congestion, but required $\tilde{O}(m \cdot \mathrm{poly}(k))$ time [BHKP08].

Method: 设计新的锦标赛规则，提出乘性成对非操纵性概念。

Result: 设计出 λ = 11 时策略证明的规则，给出 δ = 3.5 时乘性成对非操纵的规则。

Conclusion: 在解决最小 λ 规则问题上取得显著进展。

Abstract: We revisit the well-studied problem of designing fair and manipulation-resistant tournament rules. In this problem, we seek a mechanism that (probabilistically) identifies the winner of a tournament after observing round-robin play among $n$ teams in a league. Such a mechanism should satisfy the natural properties of monotonicity and Condorcet consistency. Moreover, from the league's perspective, the winner-determination tournament rule should be strategyproof, meaning that no team can do better by losing a game on purpose.
  Past work considered settings in which each team is fully selfish, caring only about its own probability of winning, and settings in which each team is fully selfless, caring only about the total winning probability of itself and the team to which it deliberately loses. More recently, researchers considered a mixture of these two settings with a parameter $λ$. Intermediate selfishness $λ$ means that a team will not lose on purpose unless its pair gains at least $λs$ winning probability, where $s$ is the individual team's sacrifice from its own winning probability. All of the dozens of previously known tournament rules require $λ= Ω(n)$ to be strategyproof, and it has been an open problem to find such a rule with the smallest $λ$.
  In this work, we make significant progress by designing a tournament rule that is strategyproof with $λ= 11$. Along the way, we propose a new notion of multiplicative pairwise non-manipulability that ensures that two teams cannot manipulate the outcome of a game to increase the sum of their winning probabilities by more than a multiplicative factor $δ$ and provide a rule which is multiplicatively pairwise non-manipulable for $δ= 3.5$.

Conclusion: 对专家查询空间的适度扩展能显著增强稳健预测聚合能力，新查询框架将开启该领域富有成果的研究方向。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust forecast aggregation: combining expert forecasts with provable accuracy guarantees compared to the best possible aggregation of the underlying information. Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022).
  In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the "order of reasoning" and number of agents relevant to a query is $ω(\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area.

Conclusion: 相关性差异是学校、大学和工作录取中群体不平等的一个被忽视的系统性来源。

Abstract: We study the role of correlation in matching markets, where multiple decision-makers simultaneously face selection problems from the same pool of candidates. We propose a model in which a candidate's priority scores across different decision-makers exhibit varying levels of correlation dependent on the candidate's sociodemographic group. Such differential correlation can arise in school choice due to the varying prevalence of selection criteria, in college admissions due to test-optional policies, or due to algorithmic monoculture, that is, when decision-makers rely on the same algorithms and data sets to evaluate candidates. We show that higher correlation for one of the groups generally improves the outcome for all groups, leading to higher efficiency. However, students from a given group are more likely to remain unmatched as their own correlation level increases. This implies that it is advantageous to belong to a low-correlation group. Finally, we extend the tie-breaking literature to multiple priority classes and intermediate levels of correlation. Overall, our results point to differential correlation as a previously overlooked systemic source of group inequalities in school, university, and job admissions.

Conclusion: 提出的DP框架和ε - 最优算法在解决LF - GSSGs的SSE计算问题上有效，有实际应用优势。

Abstract: Leader-follower general-sum stochastic games (LF-GSSGs) model sequential decision-making under asymmetric commitment, where a leader commits to a policy and a follower best responds, yielding a strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) with leader-favourable tie-breaking. This paper introduces a dynamic programming (DP) framework that applies Bellman recursion over credible sets-state abstractions formally representing all rational follower best responses under partial leader commitments-to compute SSEs. We first prove that any LF-GSSG admits a lossless reduction to a Markov decision process (MDP) over credible sets. We further establish that synthesising an optimal memoryless deterministic leader policy is NP-hard, motivating the development of ε-optimal DP algorithms with provable guarantees on leader exploitability. Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 案例研究表明相同收费策略因假设的可比性不同会导致效率估计差异大。

Conclusion: 为了稳健有效地指导大规模基础设施设计政策，定义效率指标需要明确的公理基础。

Abstract: The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a standard metric for quantifying inefficiency in socio-technical systems, widely used to guide policies like traffic tolling. Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively.

Result: 通过实验深入分析模型能力和局限，证明评估指标与人工评估高度相关，在该基准训练集微调的模型表现提升。

Conclusion: RAG - IGBench基准质量高且实用。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, providing user queries with visually enhanced responses can considerably benefit understanding and memory, underscoring the great value of interleaved image-text generation. Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments. Models fine-tuned on RAG-IGBench's training set exhibit improved performance across multiple benchmarks, confirming both the quality and practical utility of our dataset. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/RAG-IGBench.

Abstract: Relevance judgments are central to the evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, but obtaining them from human annotators is costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments.

Abstract: In enterprise settings, efficiently retrieving relevant information from large and complex knowledge bases is essential for operational productivity and informed decision-making. This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains. This work offers practical insights for deploying high-performance, scalable document retrieval solutions in enterprise settings, demonstrating that metadata enrichment is a powerful approach for enhancing RAG effectiveness.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources. Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.

Abstract: Enterprises grapple with the significant challenge of managing proprietary unstructured data, hindering efficient information retrieval. This has led to the emergence of AI-driven information retrieval solutions, designed to adeptly extract relevant insights to address employee inquiries. These solutions often leverage pre-trained embedding models and generative models as foundational components. While pre-trained embeddings may exhibit proximity or disparity based on their original training objectives, they might not fully align with the unique characteristics of enterprise-specific data, leading to suboptimal alignment with the retrieval goals of enterprise environments. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology for contextualizing pre-trained embedding models to enterprise environments, covering the entire process from data preparation to model fine-tuning and evaluation. By adapting the embeddings to better suit the retrieval tasks prevalent in enterprises, we aim to enhance the performance of information retrieval solutions. We discuss the process of fine-tuning, its effect on retrieval accuracy, and the potential benefits for enterprise information management. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuned embedding models in improving the precision and relevance of search results in enterprise settings.

TL;DR: 本文针对比特币矿机购置时机决策问题，提出MineROI - Net模型，该模型在多市场环境下表现优于基线模型，可作为实用工具降低矿业投资风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比特币矿业发展成资本密集型产业，但缺乏购置ASIC硬件的时机指导和计算框架，需解决此决策问题。

Method: 将硬件购置问题转化为时间序列分类任务，提出基于Transformer的MineROI - Net模型来捕捉矿业盈利的多尺度时间模式。

Result: 在2015 - 2024年20款ASIC矿机数据上评估，MineROI - Net准确率达83.7%，宏观F1分数达83.1%，检测无利和有利时期的精度分别达93.6%和98.5%，避免了误分类。

Conclusion: MineROI - Net为矿业硬件购置时机提供实用的数据驱动工具，可降低资本密集型矿业运营的财务风险。

Abstract: Bitcoin mining hardware acquisition requires strategic timing due to volatile markets, rapid technological obsolescence, and protocol-driven revenue cycles. Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations. The model is available through: https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/MineROI-Net.

Motivation: 机器学习技术面临计算约束、单视图学习算法局限和处理大数据集复杂性等挑战，MVC可克服这些问题，当前研究存在空白，需深入探讨。

Method: 对MVC方法进行系统分类，分析各方法优缺点和实际挑战，回顾超140篇文献，对比不同集成策略，研究实际用例。

Result: 完成MVC方法分类，深入分析其优缺点和挑战，探讨新兴趋势、跨学科应用和未来方向。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MVC研究的空白，为该领域发展提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques face numerous challenges to achieve optimal performance. These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis. By integrating these efforts, this work aims to fill existing gaps in MVC research and provide actionable insights for the advancement of the field.

TL;DR: 提出针对电子病历的波动性感知预训练策略CV - Masking，在实验室测试实验中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子病历的掩码自编码器方法多使用均匀随机掩码，未考虑特征可预测性差异，而实验室测试特征波动性不同，特别是波动大的生物标志物需更复杂建模。

Method: 提出波动性感知预训练策略Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV - Masking)，根据特征内在可变性调整掩码概率，并结合与临床工作流程一致的仅值掩码目标。

Result: CV - Masking在重建、下游预测性能和收敛速度上均有提升。

Conclusion: CV - Masking能产生更稳定、临床意义更强的电子病历表征。

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) are increasingly applied to electronic health records (EHR) for learning general-purpose representations that support diverse clinical tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.

Motivation: 目前对电子健康记录分词策略有效性的公平比较有限，需要进行系统评估。

Method: 在MIMIC - IV上对四个临床预测任务进行受控消融实验。

Result: 明确时间编码对下游任务无一致显著益处；价值特征重要性因任务而异；冻结的预训练代码编码器表现远超可训练的，且参数少；更大的临床编码器借助冻结嵌入可提升性能。

Conclusion: 受控评估实现了更公平的分词比较，简单参数高效方法在多情况下表现好，但最优分词策略因任务而异。

Abstract: Tokenization strategies shape how models process electronic health records, yet fair comparisons of their effectiveness remain limited. We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.

*Yanhua Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究结合预训练蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）与半监督学习（SSL）预测流感 A 病毒抗原性，发现 SSL 在标签稀缺时提升性能，支持快速变异株优先级确定和疫苗株选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流感 A 病毒抗原进化快需频繁更新疫苗，但传统血凝抑制（HI）测定法费力且不可扩展，基因组数据远超可用表型标签，限制传统监督模型效果。

Method: 评估两种 SSL 策略（自训练和标签传播），使用四种 PLM 衍生嵌入（ESM - 2、ProtVec、ProtT5、ProtBert）应用于血凝素（HA）序列，通过嵌套交叉验证框架模拟四种流感 A 病毒亚型（H1N1、H3N2、H5N1、H9N2）的低标签制度。

Result: SSL 在标签稀缺时持续提升性能，ProtVec 自训练相对增益最大，ESM - 2 仅 25% 标记数据时 F1 分数超 0.82，H1N1 和 H9N2 预测精度高，H3N2 亚型仍具挑战但 SSL 缓解性能下降。

Conclusion: 将 PLMs 与 SSL 结合可解决抗原性标签瓶颈，有效利用未标记监测序列，支持快速变异株优先级确定和及时疫苗株选择。

Abstract: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) evolve antigenically at a pace that requires frequent vaccine updates, yet the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays used to quantify antigenicity are labor-intensive and unscalable. As a result, genomic data vastly outpace available phenotypic labels, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised models. We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline. These findings demonstrate that integrating PLMs with SSL can address the antigenicity labeling bottleneck and enable more effective use of unlabeled surveillance sequences, supporting rapid variant prioritization and timely vaccine strain selection.

Abstract: Domain shift remains a key challenge in deploying machine learning models to the real world. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions. Finally, a practical k-means style optimisation algorithm is introduced and analysed. Experiments on three domain shift datasets demonstrate improved discrepancy estimation accuracy and target domain performance.

Method: 引入MAR - FL系统，利用基于迭代组的聚合方式。

Result: MAR - FL通信成本复杂度为O(N log N)，优于之前基线的O(N^2)，在聚合轮中节点数量增长时仍有效。

Conclusion: MAR - FL系统有效降低通信开销，对不可靠客户端有鲁棒性，还能集成隐私计算。

Abstract: The convergence of next-generation wireless systems and distributed Machine Learning (ML) demands Federated Learning (FL) methods that remain efficient and robust with wireless connected peers and under network churn. Peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes the bottleneck of a central coordinator, but existing approaches suffer from excessive communication complexity, limiting their scalability in practice. We introduce MAR-FL, a novel P2P FL system that leverages iterative group-based aggregation to substantially reduce communication overhead while retaining resilience to churn. MAR-FL achieves communication costs that scale as O(N log N), contrasting with the O(N^2) complexity of previously existing baselines, and thereby maintains effectiveness especially as the number of peers in an aggregation round grows. The system is robust towards unreliable FL clients and can integrate private computing.

Method: 提出 E - WL 算法扩展 1 - WL 以纳入边特征，基于 E - WL 引入 EGIN 模型；用 12 个带边特征的基准图数据集评估并与基线模型对比。

Result: 提出的 EGIN 模型在图分类任务的图学习中总体表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的 E - WL 算法和 EGIN 模型能有效利用边特征，提升图分类任务表现。

Abstract: As a classical approach on graph learning, the propagation-aggregation methodology is widely exploited by many of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), wherein the representation of a node is updated by aggregating representations from itself and neighbor nodes recursively. Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed EGIN models, in general, demonstrate superior performance in graph learning on graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) face severe practical constraints on near-term hardware: limited qubit counts restrict spatial resolution to coarse grids, while circuit depth limitations prevent accurate long-time integration. These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics.

Abstract: As concerns around data privacy in machine learning grow, the ability to unlearn, or remove, specific data points from trained models becomes increasingly important. While state of the art unlearning methods have emerged in response, they typically treat all points in the forget set equally. In this work, we challenge this approach by asking whether points that have a negligible impact on the model's learning need to be removed. Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient unlearning framework that reduces the size of datasets before unlearning leading to significant computational savings (up to approximately 50 percent) on real world empirical examples.

Abstract: Public-use microdata samples (PUMS) from the United States (US) Census Bureau on individuals have been available for decades. However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.

Conclusion: DMAGT在预测药物 - miRNA关联方面性能和稳定性出色，为miRNA药物开发提供新捷径。

Abstract: MiRNAs, due to their role in gene regulation, have paved a new pathway for pharmacology, focusing on drug development that targets miRNAs. However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated. The above experiments demonstrate that DMAGT has an excellent performance and stability in predicting drug-miRNA associations, providing a new shortcut for miRNA drug development.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks have emerged as interpretable alternatives to traditional multi-layer perceptrons. However, standard implementations lack principled uncertainty quantification capabilities essential for many scientific applications. We present a framework integrating sparse variational Gaussian process inference with the Kolmogorov-Arnold topology, enabling scalable Bayesian inference with computational complexity quasi-linear in sample size. Through analytic moment matching, we propagate uncertainty through deep additive structures while maintaining interpretability. We use three example studies to demonstrate the framework's ability to distinguish aleatoric from epistemic uncertainty: calibration of heteroscedastic measurement noise in fluid flow reconstruction, quantification of prediction confidence degradation in multi-step forecasting of advection-diffusion dynamics, and out-of-distribution detection in convolutional autoencoders. These results suggest Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KANs) is a promising architecture for uncertainty-aware learning in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Actor-critic (AC) methods are a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL) but offer limited interpretability. Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. Theoretically, we derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term. Empirical results on three standard continuous-control environments show that our algorithm achieves efficiency, stability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding the robustness of a weather forecasting model with respect to input noise or different uncertainties is important in assessing its output reliability, particularly for extreme weather events like hurricanes. In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.

*Xianglong Hou,Xinquan Huang,Paris Perdikaris*

TL;DR: 提出连续流算子(CFO)框架学习时变 PDE 连续时间动力学，时间分辨率不变，四基准测试表现优。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算子代理对时变 PDE 使用自回归预测方案有误差累积和时间离散化要求问题，需新方法。

Method: 利用流匹配直接学习 PDE 右侧，拟合时间样条，用有限差分估计构造概率路径，训练神经算子预测速度场。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CFO 长时稳定性好、数据效率高；用 25% 不规则子采样时间点训练效果超使用完整数据的自回归基线，相对误差最多降 87%；推理效率有竞争力，函数评估次数只需 50%，可逆向推理和任意时间查询。

Conclusion: CFO 能有效解决传统方法问题，在时变 PDE 学习中有优越性能和独特优势。

Abstract: Neural operator surrogates for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) conventionally employ autoregressive prediction schemes, which accumulate error over long rollouts and require uniform temporal discretization. We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据集MIMIC - III的实验中，CATR比现有基线得出更准确、稳定和可解释的因果效应估计。

Conclusion: CATR能缓解观测层面的正性违反，稳定下游因果效应估计器。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled the increasing use of text data in causal inference, particularly for adjusting confounding factors in treatment effect estimation. Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.

Abstract: The main objective of this study is to propose an optimal transport based semi-supervised approach to learn from scarce labelled image data using deep convolutional networks. The principle lies in implicit graph-based transductive semi-supervised learning where the similarity metric between image samples is the Wasserstein distance. This metric is used in the label propagation mechanism during learning. We apply and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a GNSS real life application. More specifically, we address the problem of multi-path interference detection. Experiments are conducted under various signal conditions. The results show that for specific choices of hyperparameters controlling the amount of semi-supervision and the level of sensitivity to the metric, the classification accuracy can be significantly improved over the fully supervised training method.

Abstract: With the increasing reliance on LLMs as research agents, distinguishing between LLM and human-generated ideas has become crucial for understanding the cognitive nuances of LLMs' research capabilities. While detecting LLM-generated text has been extensively studied, distinguishing human vs LLM-generated scientific idea remains an unexplored area. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models to differentiate between human and LLM-generated ideas, particularly after successive paraphrasing stages. Our findings highlight the challenges SOTA models face in source attribution, with detection performance declining by an average of 25.4\% after five consecutive paraphrasing stages. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the research problem as contextual information improves detection performance by up to 2.97%. Notably, our analysis reveals that detection algorithms struggle significantly when ideas are paraphrased into a simplified, non-expert style, contributing the most to the erosion of distinguishable LLM signatures.

Abstract: Classical supervised learning evaluates models primarily via predictive risk on hold-out data. Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification.

Conclusion: 解耦Actor和Critic的经验回放可增强训练动态和最终策略质量，DPER是一种可推广的机制，能提升一大类Actor - Critic离策略强化学习算法的性能。

Abstract: Background: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithms utilize Actor-Critic architectures, where both networks are typically trained using identical batches of replayed transitions. However, the learning objectives and update dynamics of the Actor and Critic differ, raising concerns about whether uniform transition usage is optimal.
  Objectives: We aim to improve the performance of deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms by decoupling the transition batches used to train the Actor and the Critic. Our goal is to design an experience replay mechanism that provides appropriate learning signals to each component by using separate, tailored batches.
  Methods: We introduce Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay (DPER), a novel approach that allows independent sampling of transition batches for the Actor and the Critic. DPER can be integrated into any off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm that operates in continuous control domains. We combine DPER with the state-of-the-art Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm and evaluate its performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.
  Results: DPER outperforms conventional experience replay strategies such as vanilla experience replay and prioritized experience replay in multiple MuJoCo tasks from the OpenAI Gym suite.
  Conclusions: Our findings show that decoupling experience replay for Actor and Critic networks can enhance training dynamics and final policy quality. DPER offers a generalizable mechanism that enhances performance for a wide class of actor-critic off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion: 新模型和算法有效，递归梯度技术可改进条件无偏梯度估计器的误差界。

Abstract: Different federated optimization algorithms typically employ distinct client-selection strategies: some methods communicate only with a randomly sampled subset of clients at each round, while others need to periodically communicate with all clients or use a hybrid scheme that combines both strategies. However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.

Conclusion: 所提LSTM方法对具有复杂时间依赖的真实数据有效

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based framework for estimating the parameters of the fractional Poisson process (FPP), which models event arrivals with memory and long-range dependence. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network estimates the key parameters $μ>0$ and $β\in(0,1)$ from sequences of inter-arrival times, effectively modeling their temporal dependencies. Our experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed approach reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by about 55.3\% compared to the traditional method of moments (MOM) and performs reliably across different training conditions. We tested the method on two real-world high-frequency datasets: emergency call records from Montgomery County, PA, and AAPL stock trading data. The results show that the LSTM can effectively track daily patterns and parameter changes, indicating its effectiveness on real-world data with complex time dependencies.

Conclusion: PATHFINDER方法有效，能改善多跳问答性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is a challenging task in which language models must reason over multiple steps to reach the correct answer. With the help of Large Language Models and their reasoning capabilities, existing systems are able to think and decompose an input question over multiple steps to analyze, retrieve, and reason. However, training-based approaches for this problem still suffer from LLM hallucinations and incorrect reasoning paths that hinder performance. Hence, we propose PATHFINDER, an approach that: (i) uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate training path traces, (ii) improves training data quality by filtering erroneous and lengthy traces using sub-answer recall and LLM-as-a-judge verification, and (iii) reformulates sub-queries to handle failed retrieval cases. By following these steps, we demonstrate that PATHFINDER improves the performance of multi-hop QA over public benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于Shapley值的方法难以评估高阶交互，缺乏同时保证公理精确性和避免指数计算爆炸的框架。

Method: 将高阶Shapley交互表示为张量网络收缩，引入IT SHAP，将STII重新表述为值张量和权重张量的收缩，并假设权重张量具有多项式TT秩的有限状态TT表示。

Result: 在TT结构模型和分布张量下，IT SHAP将STII的指数复杂度Theta(4^n)降低到NC2并行时间。

Conclusion: IT SHAP为高维模型中的主效应和高阶交互提供了统一、公理和计算可行的公式，为可扩展的交互感知可解释AI奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine learning models have grown increasingly deep and high dimensional, making it difficult to understand how individual and combined features influence their predictions. While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible.

Conclusion: 新提出的不一致损失与交叉熵结合是不一致差异的可证明一致代理，能解决现有代理的问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often fail when deployed in real-world contexts due to distribution shift, a critical barrier to building safe and reliable systems. An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically aligned for safety during the post-training phase; however, they may still generate inappropriate outputs that could potentially pose risks to users. This challenge underscores the need for robust safeguards that operate across both model inputs and outputs. In this work, we introduce Roblox Guard 1.0, a state-of-the-art instruction fine-tuned LLM designed to enhance the safety of LLM systems through comprehensive input-output moderation, using a pipeline of LLMs to enhance moderation capability. Built on the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone, our model is instruction fine-tuned to generalize across previously unseen safety taxonomies and demonstrates strong performance on out-of-domain safety benchmarks. The instruction fine-tuning process uses a mix of synthetic and open-source safety datasets, augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales and input inversion to enhance contextual understanding and decision making. To support systematic evaluation, we also release RobloxGuard-Eval, a new benchmark featuring an extensible safety taxonomy to assess the effectiveness of LLM guardrails and moderation frameworks.

Conclusion: 为可靠大语言模型辅助硬件设计开辟道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in accelerating digital hardware design through automated code generation. Yet, ensuring their reliability remains a critical challenge, as existing LLMs trained on massive heterogeneous datasets often exhibit problematic memorization of proprietary intellectual property (IP), contaminated benchmarks, and unsafe coding patterns. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes. Our work paves an avenue towards reliable LLM-assisted hardware design.

Abstract: We present a machine learning framework for predicting the structural dimensionality of hybrid metal halides (HMHs), including organic-inorganic perovskites, using a combination of chemically-informed feature engineering and advanced class-imbalance handling techniques. The dataset, consisting of 494 HMH structures, is highly imbalanced across dimensionality classes (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D), posing significant challenges to predictive modeling. This dataset was later augmented to 1336 via the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to mitigate the effects of the class imbalance. We developed interaction-based descriptors and integrated them into a multi-stage workflow that combines feature selection, model stacking, and performance optimization to improve dimensionality prediction accuracy. Our approach significantly improves F1-scores for underrepresented classes, achieving robust cross-validation performance across all dimensionalities.

Abstract: End-user development,where non-programmers create or adapt their own digital tools, can play a key role in driving digital transformation within organizations. Currently, low-code/no-code platforms are widely used to enable end-user development through visual programming, minimizing the need for manual coding. Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and "copilots", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development. The paper presents the study design, analyzes the outcomes, and discusses potential implications for practice, future research, and academic teaching.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in numerical weather prediction is to efficiently produce high-resolution forecasts. A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.

Method: 在模拟有限已知结构和实验亲和力测量的数据集分割上评估先进评分函数，研究大规模自监督预训练和利用有限测试目标数据的简单方法。

Result: 常用基准不能反映泛化到新靶点的真实挑战，自监督预训练有潜力，利用有限数据的简单方法有效。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的评估协议，为设计能泛化到新蛋白质靶点的评分函数提供实用指导。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes increasingly central to molecular design, it is vital to ensure the reliability of learnable protein-ligand scoring functions on novel protein targets. While many scoring functions perform well on standard benchmarks, their ability to generalize beyond training data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we evaluate the generalization capability of state-of-the-art scoring functions on dataset splits that simulate evaluation on targets with a limited number of known structures and experimental affinity measurements. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets. We also investigate whether large-scale self-supervised pretraining can bridge this generalization gap and we provide preliminary evidence of its potential. Furthermore, we probe the efficacy of simple methods that leverage limited test-target data to improve scoring function performance. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous evaluation protocols and offer practical guidance for designing scoring functions with predictive power extending to novel protein targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型驱动的神经架构设计存在离散、不可微问题，易出现模式崩溃或设计不可行，需要改进。

Method: 采用多轮多专家共识将孤立设计规则转化为架构线索；自适应反思探索利用奖励方差调整探索程度；帕累托引导的进化选择优化多种指标。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100等多个数据集上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 消融和迁移研究验证了RevoNAD在神经架构设计中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent progress in leveraging large language models (LLMs) has enabled Neural Architecture Design (NAD) systems to generate new architecture not limited from manually predefined search space. Nevertheless, LLM-driven generation remains challenging: the token-level design loop is discrete and non-differentiable, preventing feedback from smoothly guiding architectural improvement. These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Ablation and transfer studies further validate the effectiveness of RevoNAD in allowing practically reliable, and deployable neural architecture design.

Method: 提出Triplet - GCN单分支图卷积模型，将每次就诊表示为患者 - 特征 - 值三元组，构建二分EHR图，通过GCN和轻量级MLP学习患者嵌入，应用特定类型预处理。

Result: 在多中心队列中，Triplet - GCN在判别和平衡误差指标上始终优于KNN、SVM等强表格基线模型，有更好的灵敏度 - 特异度权衡和整体效用。

Conclusion: 将EHR编码为三元组并在患者 - 特征图上传播信息能产生更具信息性的患者表示，为脓毒症风险分层提供简单的端到端蓝图。

Abstract: In the intensive care setting, sepsis continues to be a major contributor to patient illness and death; however, its timely detection is hindered by the complex, sparse, and heterogeneous nature of electronic health record (EHR) data. We propose Triplet-GCN, a single-branch graph convolutional model that represents each encounter as patient-feature-value triplets, constructs a bipartite EHR graph, and learns patient embeddings via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve "who measured what and by how much". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70/30 train-test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity-specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning. These findings indicate that encoding EHR as triplets and propagating information over a patient-feature graph produce more informative patient representations than feature-independent models, offering a simple, end-to-end blueprint for deployable sepsis risk stratification.

Method: 提出TS - Hint，一个时间序列基础模型（TSFM）框架，集成思维链推理，在训练时基于注意力机制数据和显著性数据提供注意力提示。

Result: 实验表明模型在有限数据设置下通过少样本学习有效，能直接从多元时间序列特征学习。

Conclusion: TS - Hint框架在解决现有方法问题上表现良好，在少数据场景有应用价值。

Abstract: Existing data-driven methods rely on the extraction of static features from time series to approximate the material removal rate (MRR) of semiconductor manufacturing processes such as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). However, this leads to a loss of temporal dynamics. Moreover, these methods require a large amount of data for effective training. In this paper, we propose TS-Hint, a Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) framework, integrated with chain-of-thought reasoning which provides attention hints during training based on attention mechanism data and saliency data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in limited data settings via few-shot learning and can learn directly from multivariate time series features.

Conclusion: IdealTSF特别适用于有噪声样本或低质量数据的应用场景。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown strong performance in time series forecasting tasks. However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data.

Conclusion: 研究清晰展示了集成模型保持高精度和低过拟合的方式和时机，为实际表格应用模型选择提供指导。

Abstract: Ensemble models often achieve higher accuracy than single learners, but their ability to maintain small generalization gaps is not always well understood. This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications.

Abstract: In hierarchal order of molecular geometry, we compare the performances of Geometric Quantum Machine Learning models. Two molecular datasets are considered: the simplistic linear shaped LiH-molecule and the trigonal pyramidal molecule NH3. Both accuracy and generalizability metrics are considered. A classical equivariant model is used as a baseline for the performance comparison. The comparative performance of Quantum Machine Learning models with no symmetry equivariance, rotational and permutational equivariance, and graph embedded permutational equivariance is investigated. The performance differentials and the molecular geometry in question reveals the criteria for choice of models for generalizability. Graph embedding of features is shown to be an effective pathway to greater trainability for geometric datasets. Permutational symmetric embedding is found to be the most generalizable quantum Machine Learning model for geometric learning.

Abstract: Air turbulence refers to the disordered and irregular motion state generated by drastic changes in velocity, pressure, or direction during airflow. Various complex factors lead to intricate low-altitude turbulence outcomes. Under current observational conditions, especially when using only wind profile radar data, traditional methods struggle to accurately predict turbulence states. Therefore, this paper introduces a NeuTucker decomposition model utilizing discretized data. Designed for continuous yet sparse three-dimensional wind field data, it constructs a low-rank Tucker decomposition model based on a Tucker neural network to capture the latent interactions within the three-dimensional wind field data. Therefore, two core ideas are proposed here: 1) Discretizing continuous input data to adapt to models like NeuTucF that require discrete data inputs. 2) Constructing a four-dimensional Tucker interaction tensor to represent all possible spatio-temporal interactions among different elevations and three-dimensional wind speeds. In estimating missing observations in real datasets, this discretized NeuTucF model demonstrates superior performance compared to various common regression models.

Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling is essential for drug development but it requires significant time investment that limits the throughput of domain experts. We present \textbf{GRASP} -- a multi-agent, graph-reasoning framework with a human-in-the-loop conversational interface -- that encodes QSP models as typed biological knowledge graphs and compiles them to executable MATLAB/SimBiology code while preserving units, mass balance, and physiological constraints. A two-phase workflow -- \textsc{Understanding} (graph reconstruction of legacy code) and \textsc{Action} (constraint-checked, language-driven modification) -- is orchestrated by a state machine with iterative validation. GRASP performs breadth-first parameter-alignment around new entities to surface dependent quantities and propose biologically plausible defaults, and it runs automatic execution/diagnostics until convergence. In head-to-head evaluations using LLM-as-judge, GRASP outperforms SME-guided CoT and ToT baselines across biological plausibility, mathematical correctness, structural fidelity, and code quality (\(\approx\)9--10/10 vs.\ 5--7/10). BFS alignment achieves F1 = 0.95 for dependency discovery, units, and range. These results demonstrate that graph-structured, agentic workflows can make QSP model development both accessible and rigorous, enabling domain experts to specify mechanisms in natural language without sacrificing biomedical fidelity.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) presents a pivotal challenge in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), profoundly impacting decision-making, risk assessment and model reliability. In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Anomaly detection on data streams presents significant challenges, requiring methods to maintain high detection accuracy among evolving distributions while ensuring real-time efficiency. Here we introduce $\mathcal{IDK}$-$\mathcal{S}$, a novel $\mathbf{I}$ncremental $\mathbf{D}$istributional $\mathbf{K}$ernel for $\mathbf{S}$treaming anomaly detection that effectively addresses these challenges by creating a new dynamic representation in the kernel mean embedding framework. The superiority of $\mathcal{IDK}$-$\mathcal{S}$ is attributed to two key innovations. First, it inherits the strengths of the Isolation Distributional Kernel, an offline detector that has demonstrated significant performance advantages over foundational methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor due to the use of a data-dependent kernel. Second, it adopts a lightweight incremental update mechanism that significantly reduces computational overhead compared to the naive baseline strategy of performing a full model retraining. This is achieved without compromising detection accuracy, a claim supported by its statistical equivalence to the full retrained model. Our extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathcal{IDK}$-$\mathcal{S}$ achieves superior detection accuracy while operating substantially faster, in many cases by an order of magnitude, than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As AI models achieve remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, understanding what representations they learn and how they process information has become increasingly important for both scientific progress and trustworthy deployment. Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape. We provide the first theoretical explanations for some empirically observed phenomena, including feature absorption, dead neurons, and the neuron resampling technique. We further design controlled experiments to validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: SCoNE方法能有效解决现有多视图异常检测方法的问题，具有更好性能。

Abstract: The core problem in multi-view anomaly detection is to represent local neighborhoods of normal instances consistently across all views. Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process. They suffer from two key issues. First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \textbf{S}pherical \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{N}eighborhoods \textbf{E}nsemble (SCoNE). It has two unique features: (a) the consistent neighborhoods are represented with multi-view instances directly, requiring no intermediate representations as used in existing approaches; and (b) the neighborhoods have data-dependent properties, which lead to large neighborhoods in sparse regions and small neighborhoods in dense regions. The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity. Empirical evaluations show that SCoNE has superior detection accuracy and runs orders-of-magnitude faster in large datasets than existing approaches.

Motivation: 传统Best-of-$n$依赖单模型，而大语言模型在不同任务有互补优势，需多模型替代方案。

Method: 提出RoBoN，基于奖励模型和预测响应的一致性信号，在一组模型中逐个顺序路由生成。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，RoBoN比应用于单个模型的标准Best-of-$n$表现更好，绝对准确率最高提升3.4%，也优于统一多模型组合基线。

Conclusion: 可以在推理时利用模型间的多样性，以简单、无需训练的方式提升Best-of-$n$性能。

Abstract: Best-of-$n$ is a widely used test-time scaling approach for LLM inference. Yet despite evidence that LLMs exhibit complementary strengths across tasks, traditionally best-of-$n$ relies on a single model to generate responses. We propose RoBoN (Routed Online Best-of-$n$), a sequential multi-LLM alternative to the prevailing single-model best-of-$n$. Given a suite of models $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^M$, RoBoN sequentially routes generations one-by-one across models, based on scores computed using a reward model and an agreement signal on the predicted responses. This online routing requires no additional training, keeps compute parity, and works with any plug-in reward model. Across reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, MinervaMath, GSM8K, MMLU), RoBoN consistently outperforms standard best-of-$n$ applied to each individual model for larger $n$, with gains of up to 3.4\% in absolute accuracy, and also improves over a uniform multi-model portfolio baseline. Our results indicate that diversity across models can be exploited at inference to improve best-of-$n$ performance over any constituent model alone, providing a simple, training-free path to test-time scaling with multiple LLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of black-box machine learning models and their adoption in high-stakes areas, it is critical to provide explanations for their predictions. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.

Motivation: 大语言模型强化学习中离策略训练范式存在分布偏移，导致训练不稳定，PPO - Clip 无法处理全局动作分布偏移。

Method: 提出用当前和之前策略的熵比作为新全局指标，引入 ERC 机制对熵比施加双向约束，并集成到 DAPO 和 GPPO 算法中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ERC 持续提升了性能。

Conclusion: ERC 机制能稳定策略更新，弥补 PPO - Clip 的不足，提升算法性能。

Abstract: Large language model post-training relies on reinforcement learning to improve model capability and alignment quality. However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrate ERC into both DAPO and GPPO reinforcement learning algorithms. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that ERC consistently improves performance.

TL;DR: 研究通过超参数转移扩展预条件优化器，发现学习率和权重衰减的缩放规则，应用规则后Muon和Shampoo在训练Llama架构语言模型时比AdamW有加速效果，强调研究最优超参数转移对大规模比较优化器的重要性。

Motivation: 现有矩阵级预条件深度学习优化器在小规模实验有加速效果，但验证和复现结果不一，为了解其大规模有效性。

Method: 研究多种优化器（如Shampoo、SOAP、Muon）的最优学习率和权重衰减随模型宽度和深度的缩放情况，考虑分块和嫁接等技术的影响。

Result: 按μP缩放学习率可改善转移，但有有限宽度偏差，分块和显式谱归一化可缓解；计算最优缩放时，独立权重衰减按1/width缩放近乎最优；应用规则后，Muon和Shampoo在训练特定规模Llama架构语言模型时比AdamW有1.4×和1.3×的加速，错误缩放时加速消失。

Conclusion: 在现实调优预算下，研究最优超参数转移对可靠地大规模比较优化器至关重要。

Abstract: Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $μ$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $μ$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\times$ and $1.3\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.

Motivation: 现有社区检测中，许多方法需用户提前指定聚类数量，GNN 即便指定数量也常无法准确返回，要解决此局限。

Method: 提出一个框架，允许用户指定合理范围并在训练中强制执行边界，也可指定确切数量。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 可灵活控制 GNN 发现的社区数量。

Abstract: In community detection, many methods require the user to specify the number of clusters in advance since an exhaustive search over all possible values is computationally infeasible. While some classical algorithms can infer this number directly from the data, this is typically not the case for graph neural networks (GNNs): even when a desired number of clusters is specified, standard GNN-based methods often fail to return the exact number due to the way they are designed. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a flexible and principled way to control the number of communities discovered by GNNs. Rather than assuming the true number of clusters is known, we propose a framework that allows the user to specify a plausible range and enforce these bounds during training. However, if the user wants an exact number of clusters, it may also be specified and reliably returned.

Conclusion: SGTM是现有安全缓解措施在预训练阶段的有前景补充，尤其在不可避免有标签噪声的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models increasingly possess capabilities that carry dual-use risks. While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于POMDP的方法在波束选择问题上优于以往方法。

Abstract: Beamforming-capable antenna arrays with many elements enable higher data rates in next generation 5G and 6G networks. In current practice, analog beamforming uses a codebook of pre-configured beams with each of them radiating towards a specific direction, and a beam management function continuously selects \textit{optimal} beams for moving user equipments (UEs). However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams. This frames the beam selection problem as an online search procedure that locates the moving optimal beam. In contrast to previous work, our method handles new or unforeseen trajectories and changes in the physical environment, and outperforms previous work by orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Chemical reaction mechanisms provide crucial insight into synthesizability, yet current Computer-Assisted Synthesis Planning (CASP) systems lack mechanistic grounding. We introduce a computational framework for teaching language models to predict chemical reaction mechanisms through arrow pushing formalism, a century-old notation that tracks electron flow while respecting conservation laws. We developed MechSMILES, a compact textual format encoding molecular structure and electron flow, and trained language models on four mechanism prediction tasks of increasing complexity using mechanistic reaction datasets, such as mech-USPTO-31k and FlowER. Our models achieve more than 95\% top-3 accuracy on elementary step prediction and scores that surpass 73\% on mech-USPTO-31k, and 93\% on FlowER dataset for the retrieval of complete reaction mechanisms on our hardest task. This mechanistic understanding enables three key applications. First, our models serve as post-hoc validators for CASP systems, filtering chemically implausible transformations. Second, they enable holistic atom-to-atom mapping that tracks all atoms, including hydrogens. Third, they extract catalyst-aware reaction templates that distinguish recycled catalysts from spectator species. By grounding predictions in physically meaningful electron moves that ensure conservation of mass and charge, this work provides a pathway toward more explainable and chemically valid computational synthesis planning, while providing an architecture-agnostic framework for the benchmarking of mechanism prediction.

Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how gating mechanisms determine the learnability window $\mathcal{H}_N$ of recurrent neural networks, defined as the largest temporal horizon over which gradient information remains statistically recoverable. While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \emph{effective learning rates} $μ_{t,\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($α$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\ell$ satisfies $N(\ell)\propto f(\ell)^{-α}$, where $f(\ell)=\|μ_{t,\ell}\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: TopK SAEs足以将潜在特征映射到概念，Ordered SAEs在需要精确生成引导时更优。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a mechanistic interpretability technique that have been used to provide insight into learned concepts within large protein language models. Here, we employ TopK and Ordered SAEs to investigate an autoregressive antibody language model, p-IgGen, and steer its generation. We show that TopK SAEs can reveal biologically meaningful latent features, but high feature concept correlation does not guarantee causal control over generation. In contrast, Ordered SAEs impose an hierarchical structure that reliably identifies steerable features, but at the expense of more complex and less interpretable activation patterns. These findings advance the mechanistic interpretability of domain-specific protein language models and suggest that, while TopK SAEs are sufficient for mapping latent features to concepts, Ordered SAEs are preferable when precise generative steering is required.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to construct compact synthetic datasets that allow models to achieve comparable performance to full-data training while substantially reducing storage and computation. Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation.

Abstract: Hypervolume (HV)-based Bayesian optimization (BO) is one of the standard approaches for multi-objective decision-making. However, the computational cost of optimizing the acquisition function remains a significant bottleneck, primarily due to the expense of HV improvement calculations. While HV box-decomposition offers an efficient way to cope with the frequent exact improvement calculations, it suffers from super-polynomial memory complexity $O(MN^{\lfloor \frac{M + 1}{2} \rfloor})$ in the worst case as proposed by Lacour et al. (2017). To tackle this problem, Couckuyt et al. (2012) employed an approximation algorithm. However, a rigorous algorithmic description is currently absent from the literature. This paper bridges this gap by providing comprehensive mathematical and algorithmic details of this approximation algorithm.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are a promising alternative to diffusion-based models for 3D molecular structure generation. However, a key limitation is the assumption of a token order: while text has a natural sequential order, the next token prediction given a molecular graph prefix should be invariant to atom permutations. Previous works sidestepped this mismatch by using canonical orders or focus atoms. We argue that this is unnecessary. We introduce NEAT, a Neighborhood-guided, Efficient, Autoregressive, Set Transformer that treats molecular graphs as sets of atoms and learns the order-agnostic distribution over admissible tokens at the graph boundary with an autoregressive flow model. NEAT approaches state-of-the-art performance in 3D molecular generation with high computational efficiency and atom-level permutation invariance, establishing a practical foundation for scalable molecular design.

Abstract: We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.3 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.

Abstract: Modern high-frequency trading (HFT) environments are characterized by sudden price spikes that present both risk and opportunity, but conventional financial models often fail to capture the required fine temporal structure. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired framework well-suited to these challenges due to their natural ability to process discrete events and preserve millisecond-scale timing. This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return). These results validate the potential of spiking networks, when robustly tuned with task-specific objectives, for effective price spike forecasting in HFT.

Abstract: The function and lifetime of moving mechanical assemblies (MMAs) in space depend on the properties of lubricants. MMAs that experience high speeds or high cycles require liquid based lubricants due to their ability to reflow to the point of contact. However, only a few liquid-based lubricants have vapor pressures low enough for the vacuum conditions of space, each of which has limitations that add constraints to MMA designs. This work introduces a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predicting vapor pressure, enabling virtual screening and discovery of new space-suitable liquid lubricants. The ML models are trained with data from both high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations and experimental databases. The models are designed to prioritize interpretability, enabling the relationships between chemical structure and vapor pressure to be identified. Based on these insights, several candidate molecules are proposed that may have promise for future space lubricant applications in MMAs.

Abstract: To create state-of-the-art models for many downstream tasks, it has become common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained large vision model. However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection.

Conclusion: DAE - HardNet在满足物理约束上表现出色，能学习导数，特定问题可绕过投影层加速推理，代码开源。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not always satisfy physics based constraints, especially when the constraints include differential operators. Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet.

Abstract: Deep residual networks (ResNets) have demonstrated outstanding success in computer vision tasks, attributed to their ability to maintain gradient flow through deep architectures. Simultaneously, controlling the Lipschitz constant in neural networks has emerged as an essential area of research to enhance adversarial robustness and network certifiability. This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems. The $LDL^\top$ formulation is shown to be a tight relaxation of the SDP-based network, maintaining full expressiveness and achieving 3\%-13\% accuracy gains over SLL Layers on 121 UCI data sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法忽略注意力基于内积的本质，导致近似注意力矩阵效果不佳，需更优压缩方法。

Method: 引入KQ - SVD方法，通过闭式解直接对注意力矩阵进行最优低秩分解。

Result: 在LLaMA和Mistral模型上的大量评估表明，KQ - SVD方法投影质量始终更优。

Conclusion: KQ - SVD方法通过针对冗余的真正来源，在压缩时能更高保真地保留注意力输出。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is central to the efficiency of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), storing previously computed vectors to accelerate inference. Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA and Mistral models demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers superior projection quality.

Motivation: 现实应用中数据不完整问题普遍，标准插补方法假设强，对复杂异构数据不适用。

Method: 提出Impugan，基于条件生成对抗网络，在完整样本上训练学习缺失变量与观测变量关系，推理时生成器重构缺失值，判别器区分真实与插补数据。

Result: 在基准数据集和多源整合任务中，与领先基线相比，Impugan的地球移动距离降低82%，互信息偏差降低70%。

Conclusion: 对抗训练的生成模型为插补和合并不完整、异构数据提供可扩展且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world applications. Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

Result: 在三个多跳问答数据集上评估，MaxShapley归因质量与精确Shapley计算相当，资源消耗大幅降低。

Conclusion: MaxShapley算法在公平归因方面表现良好，能以较低资源消耗达到较好效果。

Abstract: Generative search engines based on large language models (LLMs) are replacing traditional search, fundamentally changing how information providers are compensated. To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers. We introduce MaxShapley, an efficient algorithm for fair attribution in generative search pipelines that use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.

Conclusion: 所提出的从显式目标分布出发并用α - 散度族近似的方法能有效解决强化学习调优大语言模型的多样性问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the de facto standard for tuning LLMs to solve tasks involving reasoning. However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the "mode-seeking" or "zero-forcing" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNN)-based receiver for 5G-NR OFDM system, called neuromorphic receiver (NeuromorphicRx), replacing the channel estimation, equalization and symbol demapping blocks. We leverage domain knowledge to design the input with spiking encoding and propose a deep convolutional SNN with spike-element-wise residual connections.

We focus on generalization across diverse scenarios and robustness through quantized aware training. We focus on interpretability of NeuromorphicRx for 5G-NR signals and perform detailed ablation study for 5G-NR signals. Our extensive numerical simulations show that NeuromorphicRx is capable of achieving significant block error rate performance gain compared to 5G-NR receivers and similar performance compared to its ANN-based counterparts with 7.6x less energy consumption.

Conclusion: 为SNNs的时间机制提供了新视角，为视频理解中的时空建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered naturally suited for temporal processing, with membrane potential propagation widely regarded as the core temporal modeling mechanism. However, existing research lack analysis of its actual contributions in complex temporal tasks. We design Non-Stateful (NS) models progressively removing membrane propagation to quantify its stage-wise role. Experiments reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: moderate removal in shallow or deep layers improves performance, while excessive removal causes collapse. We attribute this to spatio-temporal resource competition where neurons encode both semantics and dynamics within limited range, with temporal state consuming capacity for spatial learning. Based on this, we propose Spatial-Temporal Separable Network (STSep), decoupling residual blocks into independent spatial and temporal branches. The spatial branch focuses on semantic extraction while the temporal branch captures motion through explicit temporal differences. Experiments on Something-Something V2, UCF101, and HMDB51 show STSep achieves superior performance, with retrieval task and attention analysis confirming focus on motion rather than static appearance. This work provides new perspectives on SNNs' temporal mechanisms and an effective solution for spatiotemporal modeling in video understanding.

Result: 在挑战性基准函数实验中，WE收敛性能有竞争力，种群多样性远高于经典方法，能有效应对多峰景观。

Conclusion: 工作不仅提供有效优化算法，还为通过统计物理理解进化计算提供新范式。

Abstract: This paper establishes a novel connection between evolutionary computation and statistical physics by formalizing evolutionary optimization as a phase transition process. We introduce Wasserstein Evolution (WE), a principled optimization framework that implements the Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy functional, mathematically bridging evolutionary dynamics with thermodynamics. WE directly translates the physical competition between potential gradient forces (exploitation) and entropic forces (exploration) into algorithmic dynamics, providing an adaptive, theoretically grounded mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. Experiments on challenging benchmark functions demonstrate that WE achieves competitive convergence performance while maintaining dramatically higher population diversity than classical methods (GA, DE, CMA-ES).This superior entropy preservation enables effective navigation of multi-modal landscapes without premature convergence, validating the physical interpretation of optimization as a disorder-to-order transition. Our work provides not only an effective optimization algorithm but also a new paradigm for understanding evolutionary computation through statistical physics.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), central to computational neuroscience and neuromorphic machine learning (ML), require efficient simulation and gradient-based training. While AI accelerators offer promising speedups, gradient-based SNNs typically implement sparse spike events using dense, memory-heavy data-structures. Existing exact gradient methods lack generality, and current simulators often omit or inefficiently handle delayed spikes. We address this by deriving gradient computation through spike event queues, including delays, and implementing memory-efficient, gradient-enabled event queue structures. These are benchmarked across CPU, GPU, TPU, and LPU platforms. We find that queue design strongly shapes performance. CPUs, as expected, perform well with traditional tree-based or FIFO implementations, while GPUs excel with ring buffers for smaller simulations, yet under higher memory pressure prefer more sparse data-structures. TPUs seem to favor an implementation based on sorting intrinsics. Selective spike dropping provides a simple performance-accuracy trade-off, which could be enhanced by future autograd frameworks adapting diverging primal/tangent data-structures.

Result: 在229个蕴含式基准测试中，使用5个库98个策略自动净化了95.6%（219个）的蕴含式。

Conclusion: Stellis具有灵活性和便利性，且高效。

Abstract: Automatically proving separation logic entailments is a fundamental challenge in verification. While rule-based methods rely on separation logic rules (lemmas) for automation, these rule statements are insufficient for describing automation strategies, which usually involve the alignment and elimination of corresponding memory layouts in specific scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Stellis, a strategy language for purifying separation logic entailments, i.e., removing all spatial formulas to reduce the entailment to a simpler pure entailment. Stellis features a powerful matching mechanism and a flexible action description, enabling the straightforward encoding of a wide range of strategies. To ensure strategy soundness, we introduce an algorithm that generates a soundness condition for each strategy, thereby reducing the soundness of each strategy to the correctness of its soundness condition. Furthermore, based on a mechanized reduction soundness theorem, our prototype implementation generates correctness proofs for the overall automation. We evaluate our system on a benchmark of 229 entailments collected from verification of standard linked data structures and the memory module of a microkernel, and the evaluation results demonstrate that, with such flexibility and convenience provided, our system is also highly effective, which automatically purifies 95.6% (219 out of 229) of the entailments using 5 libraries with 98 strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究为AI技术在实践中的文化对齐提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology, and thus, we have seen widespread adoption and use on software engineering teams. Most often, LLMs are designed as "general purpose" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of "culturally-informed" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge. Our work provides a critical foundation for research and development aimed at cultural alignment of AI technologies in practice.

Abstract: Developers are widely using AI code-generation models, aiming to increase productivity and efficiency. However, there are also quality concerns regarding the AI-generated code. The generated code is produced by models trained on publicly available code, which are known to contain bugs and quality issues. Those issues can cause trust and maintenance challenges during the development process. Several quality issues associated with AI-generated code have been reported, including bugs and defects. However, these findings are often scattered and lack a systematic summary. A comprehensive review is currently lacking to reveal the types and distribution of these errors, possible remediation strategies, as well as their correlation with the specific models. In this paper, we systematically analyze the existing AI-generated code literature to establish an overall understanding of bugs and defects in generated code, providing a reference for future model improvement and quality assessment. We aim to understand the nature and extent of bugs in AI-generated code, and provide a classification of bug types and patterns present in code generated by different models. We also discuss possible fixes and mitigation strategies adopted to eliminate bugs from the generated code.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of generative AI tools is transforming the way software is developed. Consequently, software engineering education must adapt to ensure that students not only learn traditional development methods but also understand how to meaningfully and responsibly use these new technologies. In particular, project-based courses offer an effective environment to explore and evaluate the integration of AI assistance into real-world development practices. This paper presents our approach and a user study conducted within a university programming project in which students collaboratively developed computer games. The study investigates how participants used generative AI tools throughout different phases of the software development process, identifies the types of tasks where such tools were most effective, and analyzes the challenges students encountered. Building on these insights, we further examine a repository-aware, locally deployed large language model (LLM) assistant designed to provide project-contextualized support. The system employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground responses in relevant documentation and source code, enabling qualitative analysis of model behavior, parameter sensitivity, and common failure modes. The findings deepen our understanding of context-aware AI support in educational software projects and inform future integration of AI-based assistance into software engineering curricula.

Conclusion: Model Gateway是模型驱动药物发现流程的基础部分，随着MLOps基础设施成熟和工具集成，有加速新药开发的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents the Model Gateway, a management platform for managing machine learning (ML) and scientific computational models in the drug discovery pipeline. The platform supports Large Language Model (LLM) Agents and Generative AI-based tools to perform ML model management tasks in our Machine Learning operations (MLOps) pipelines, such as the dynamic consensus model, a model that aggregates several scientific computational models, registration and management, retrieving model information, asynchronous submission/execution of models, and receiving results once the model complete executions. The platform includes a Model Owner Control Panel, Platform Admin Tools, and Model Gateway API service for interacting with the platform and tracking model execution. The platform achieves a 0% failure rate when testing scaling beyond 10k simultaneous application clients consume models. The Model Gateway is a fundamental part of our model-driven drug discovery pipeline. It has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of new drugs with the maturity of our MLOps infrastructure and the integration of LLM Agents and Generative AI tools.

Abstract: Code review is a socio-technical practice, yet how software engineers engage in Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted code reviews compared to human peer-led reviews is less understood. We report a two-phase qualitative study with 20 software engineers to understand this. In Phase I, participants exchanged peer reviews and were interviewed about their affective responses and engagement decisions. In Phase II, we introduced a new prompt matching engineers' preferences and probed how characteristics shaped their reactions. We develop an integrative account linking emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution. We identify self-regulation strategies that engineers use to regulate their emotions in response to negative feedback: reframing, dialogic regulation, avoidance, and defensiveness. Engagement proceeds through social calibration; engineers align their responses and behaviors to the relational climate and team norms. Trajectories to resolution, in the case of peer-led review, vary by locus (solo/dyad/team) and an internal sense-making process. With the LLM-assisted review, emotional costs and the need for self-regulation seem lower. When LLM feedback aligned with engineers' cognitive expectations, participants reported reduced processing effort and a potentially higher tendency to adopt. We show that LLM-assisted review redirects engagement from emotion management to cognitive load management. We contribute an integrative model of engagement that links emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution, showing how affective and cognitive processes influence feedback adoption in peer-led and LLM-assisted code reviews. We conclude that AI is best positioned as a supportive partner to reduce cognitive and emotional load while preserving human accountability and the social meaning of peer review and similar socio-technical activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多仓库微服务架构的错误定位存在自然语言错误报告与代码语义差距、LLM上下文限制、需先确定正确仓库等挑战。

Method: 将代码库转换为分层自然语言摘要，进行自然语言到自然语言的搜索，构建文件、目录和仓库级别的上下文感知摘要，采用两阶段搜索。

Result: 在DNext系统上，Pass@10达到0.82，MRR达到0.50，显著优于检索基线和代理RAG系统。

Conclusion: 工程化自然语言表示比原始源代码更适合可扩展的错误定位，提供可解释的搜索路径，对企业AI工具建立信任很重要。

Abstract: Bug localization in multi-repository microservice architectures is challenging due to the semantic gap between natural language bug reports and code, LLM context limitations, and the need to first identify the correct repository. We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency.

Motivation: 现有学术文献缺乏AI辅助开发工具在合规相关大规模工业环境部署的研究，但行业对此工具的采用在增加。

Method: 介绍WhatsCode系统从2023 - 2025年25个月在工业中的部署和发展过程。

Result: WhatsCode提升隐私验证覆盖率3.5倍，产生大量代码更改，维持较高的错误分类精度，发现两种人机协作模式。

Conclusion: 组织因素和技术能力对企业级AI成功同样重要，有效人机协作驱动可持续商业影响。

Abstract: The deployment of AI-assisted development tools in compliance-relevant, large-scale industrial environments represents significant gaps in academic literature, despite growing industry adoption. We report on the industrial deployment of WhatsCode, a domain-specific AI development system that supports WhatsApp (serving over 2 billion users) and processes millions of lines of code across multiple platforms. Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes.
  WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success. The findings provide evidence-based guidance for large-scale AI tool deployment in compliance-relevant environments, showing that effective human-AI collaboration, not full automation, drives sustainable business impact.

Motivation: 无服务器函数调度优化有挑战，数据局部性在无服务器平台应用待探索。

Method: 系统评估现有延迟调度方法，提出Metronome框架，利用在线随机森林回归模型预测函数执行时间。

Result: Metronome显著优于基线，函数平均执行时间降低64.88%-95.83%，并发时保持优势且确保SLA合规。

Conclusion: Metronome能有效优化无服务器函数的延迟调度。

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.

Abstract: Neurodivergent women in Software Engineering (SE) encounter distinctive challenges at the intersection of gender bias and neurological differences. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work in SE research has systematically examined this group, despite increasing recognition of neurodiversity in the workplace. Underdiagnosis, masking, and male-centric workplace cultures continue to exacerbate barriers that contribute to stress, burnout, and attrition. In response, we propose a hybrid methodological approach that integrates InclusiveMag's inclusivity framework with the GenderMag walkthrough process, tailored to the context of neurodivergent women in SE. The overarching design unfolds across three stages, scoping through literature review, deriving personas and analytic processes, and applying the method in collaborative workshops. We present a targeted literature review that synthesize challenges into cognitive, social, organizational, structural and career progression challenges neurodivergent women face in SE, including how under/late diagnosis and masking intensify exclusion. These findings lay the groundwork for subsequent stages that will develop and apply inclusive analytic methods to support actionable change.

Motivation: 电信网络依赖配置定义路由行为，BGP配置错误会导致严重故障和安全漏洞，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出BGPFuzz，一种结构感知且有状态的模糊测试框架，在虚拟网络中系统地改变BGP配置，通过运行时异常检测来发现异常。

Result: 实验表明BGPFuzz能可靠地重现和检测已知故障，如最大前缀违规和子前缀劫持。

Conclusion: BGPFuzz为识别BGP配置错误提供了一种经济有效的方法。

Abstract: Telecommunications networks rely on configurations to define routing behavior, especially in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), where misconfigurations can lead to severe outages and security breaches, as demonstrated by the 2021 Facebook outage. Unlike existing approaches that rely on synthesis or verification, our work offers a cost-effective method for identifying misconfigurations resulting from BGP's inherent complexity or vendor-specific implementations. We present BGPFuzz, a structure-aware and stateful fuzzing framework that systematically mutates BGP configurations and evaluates their effects in virtualized network. Without requiring predefined correctness properties as in static analysis, BGPFuzz detects anomalies through runtime oracles that capture practical symptoms such as session resets, blackholing, and traffic redirection. Our experiments show that BGPFuzz can reliably reproduce and detect known failures, including max-prefix violations and sub-prefix hijacks.

Conclusion: 人工智能在大型机现代化中是推动数字化转型和企业可持续增长的关键因素。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-assisted legacy modernization is essential in changing the stalwart mainframe systems of the past into flexible, scalable, and smart architecture. While mainframes are generally dependable, they can be difficult to maintain due to their high maintenance costs, the shortage of skills, and the problems in integrating them with cloud-based systems. By adopting AI-driven modernization strategies such as automated code refactoring, migration of data using smart tools, and predictive maintenance, companies can easily move to microservices, containerized environments, and hybrid cloud platforms. Machine learning models have the capability to go through legacy codebases, figure out efficiency opportunities, and carry out automated testing and deployment. Besides that, AI improves the organization's operational efficiency by generating the insights that can be used to level the workload and detect the anomalies. The coupling of the two is not only about saving the core business logic but also about enabling quicker innovation, less downtime, and enhanced system resilience. Therefore, the use of AI in mainframe modernization is a catalyst for digital transformation and enterprise growth that is sustainable over time.

Conclusion: 以违规为重点的模糊测试将安全评估变为可重复过程，为下一代神经接口的基准测试、监管和伦理保障奠定基础。

Abstract: Objective: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to generate electrical stimulation patterns in neuroprosthetic devices such as visual prostheses. While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies. Significance: Violation-focused fuzzing reframes safety assessment as an empirical, reproducible process. By transforming safety from a training heuristic into a measurable property of the deployed model, it establishes a foundation for evidence-based benchmarking, regulatory readiness, and ethical assurance in next-generation neural interfaces.

Result: Bita支持对现实AI系统的公平性测试任务，提供了结构化、可重复的实用证据。

Conclusion: 工作贡献了一个实用工具，使公平性测试更易操作、系统化且适用于工业实践。

Abstract: Bias in AI systems can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes, especially when left untested before deployment. Although fairness testing aims to identify and mitigate such bias, existing tools are often difficult to use, requiring advanced expertise and offering limited support for real-world workflows. To address this, we introduce Bita, a conversational assistant designed to help software testers detect potential sources of bias, evaluate test plans through a fairness lens, and generate fairness-oriented exploratory testing charters. Bita integrates a large language model with retrieval-augmented generation, grounding its responses in curated fairness literature. Our validation demonstrates how Bita supports fairness testing tasks on real-world AI systems, providing structured, reproducible evidence of its utility. In summary, our work contributes a practical tool that operationalizes fairness testing in a way that is accessible, systematic, and directly applicable to industrial practice.

Conclusion: 该架构为生成式AI系统提供可重用基础，支持可验证、可维护和适用于行业的系统。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has reshaped software system design by introducing foundation models as pre-trained subsystems that redefine architectures and operations. The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering-how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing transient artefacts that limit traceability and accountability. This paper proposes a file-system abstraction for context engineering, inspired by the Unix notion that 'everything is a file'. The abstraction offers a persistent, governed infrastructure for managing heterogeneous context artefacts through uniform mounting, metadata, and access control. Implemented within the open-source AIGNE framework, the architecture realises a verifiable context-engineering pipeline, comprising the Context Constructor, Loader, and Evaluator, that assembles, delivers, and validates context under token constraints. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator in decision support, humans play a central role as curators, verifiers, and co-reasoners. The proposed architecture establishes a reusable foundation for accountable and human-centred AI co-work, demonstrated through two exemplars: an agent with memory and an MCP-based GitHub assistant. The implementation within the AIGNE framework demonstrates how the architecture can be operationalised in developer and industrial settings, supporting verifiable, maintainable, and industry-ready GenAI systems.

Method: 提出iEcoreGen，分解需求得到操作规范，用EMF模板生成初始Java代码，序列化规范到文档字符串，调用大语言模型完成和修复未实现方法。

Result: 在20个代码生成任务中评估，iEcoreGen在pass@k上超越仅用大语言模型的基线，在compilation@k上表现相当，消融研究明确各组件贡献。

Conclusion: 大语言模型增强的模型驱动开发是更高效软件自动化的有前景路径。

Abstract: Template-based and LLM-based code generation are both key enablers of automated software development. The former provides correctness guarantees but are rigid for complex requirements, whereas LLMs offer high flexibility at the risk of producing faulty code.This paper proposes iEcoreGen, a hybrid approach that integrates Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and LLMs. In EMF, an Ecore model defines a system structure and acts as a blueprint for code-generation.iEcoreGen decomposes requirements to derive operation specifications, uses EMF's template-based generator to produce initial Java code, and serializes specifications into docstrings. LLMs are then invoked to complete and fix unimplemented methods. We assessed iEcoreGen on twenty code-generation tasks across five LLMs. It surpasses LLM-only baselines on pass@k and performs on par with them on compilation@k. An ablation study clarified the contribution of each component of iEcoreGen. Overall, the findings indicate that LLM-enhanced model-driven development is a promising path toward more efficient software automation.

Abstract: Quality assurance for large-scale cyber-physical systems relies on sophisticated test activities using complex test environments investigated with the help of numerous types of simulators. As these systems grow, extensive resources are required to develop and maintain simulation models of hardware and software components, as well as physical environments. Meanwhile, recent advances in generative AI have led to tools that can produce executable test cases for software systems, offering potential benefits such as reducing manual efforts or increasing test coverage. However, the application of generative AI techniques to simulation-based testing of large-scale cyber-physical systems remains underexplored. To better understand this gap, this study captures practitioners' perspectives on leveraging generative AI, based on a cross-company workshop with six organizations. Our contribution is twofold: (1) detailed, experience-based insights into challenges faced by engineers, and (2) a research agenda comprising three high-priority directions: (a) AI-generated scenarios and environment models, (b) simulators and AI in CI/CD pipelines, and (c) trustworthiness in generative AI for simulation. While participants acknowledged substantial potential, they also highlighted unresolved challenges. By detailing these issues, the paper aims to guide future academia-industry collaboration towards the responsible adoption of generative AI in simulation-based testing.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping Software Engineering (SE), creating new opportunities while introducing human-centered challenges. Although prior work notes behavioral and other non-technical factors in AI integration, most studies still emphasize technical concerns and offer limited insight into how teams adapt to and trust AI. This paper proposes a Behavioral Software Engineering (BSE)-informed, human-centric framework to support SE organizations during early AI adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, we built and refined the framework through a literature review of organizational change models and thematic analysis of interview data, producing concrete, actionable steps. The framework comprises nine dimensions: AI Strategy Design, AI Strategy Evaluation, Collaboration, Communication, Governance and Ethics, Leadership, Organizational Culture, Organizational Dynamics, and Up-skilling, each supported by design principles and actions. To gather preliminary practitioner input, we conducted a survey (N=105) and two expert workshops (N=4). Survey results show that Up-skilling (15.2%) and AI Strategy Design (15.1%) received the highest $100-method allocations, underscoring their perceived importance in early AI initiatives. Findings indicate that organizations currently prioritize procedural elements such as strategy design, while human-centered guardrails remain less developed. Workshop feedback reinforced these patterns and emphasized the need to ground the framework in real-world practice. By identifying key behavioral dimensions and offering actionable guidance, this work provides a pragmatic roadmap for navigating the socio-technical complexity of early AI adoption and highlights future research directions for human-centric AI in SE.

Conclusion: CODEOWNERS是改善软件治理和弹性的有潜力但未充分利用的机制，项目可借此增强开源开发的安全性、问责制和工作流效率。

Abstract: Code ownership is central to ensuring accountability and maintaining quality in large-scale software development. Yet, as external threats such as software supply chain attacks on project health and quality assurance increase, mechanisms for assigning and enforcing responsibility have become increasingly critical. In 2017, GitHub introduced the CODEOWNERS feature, which automatically designates reviewers for specific files to strengthen accountability and protect critical parts of the codebase. Despite its potential, little is known about how CODEOWNERS is actually adopted and practiced. We present the first large-scale empirical study of CODEOWNERS usage across over 844,000 pull requests with 1.9 million comments and over 2 million reviews. We identify 10,287 code owners to track their review activities. Results indicate that codeowners tend to adhere the rules specified in the CODEOWNERS file, exhibit similar collaborative behaviours to traditional metrics of ownership, but tend to contribute to a smoother and faster PR workflow over time. Finally, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, we find that repositories adopting CODEOWNERS experience shifts in review dynamics, as ownership redistributes review responsibilities away from core developers. Our results position CODEOWNERS as a promising yet underutilized mechanism for improving software governance and resilience. We discuss how projects can leverage this alternative ownership method as a perspective to enhance security, accountability, and workflow efficiency in open-source development.

Hybrid declarative specifications, utilizing Signal Temporal Logic (STL), address this limitation by allowing constraints over both discrete events and real-valued signals. However, existing work has been limited to monitoring and post-hoc conformance checking. This paper introduces a novel Complex Event Processing (CEP)-based execution architecture that enables the real-time execution and enforcement of hybrid declarative models. Our three-layer approach integrates STL-inspired predicates into the execution flow, allowing the system to actively trigger activities and enforce process boundaries based on continuous sensor behavior. This approach bridges the gap between hybrid specification and operational control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务系统易受并发错误影响，现有检测方法有侵入性且难以处理微服务架构复杂性。

Method: 在运行时动态插桩常用库收集详细跟踪数据，分析先发生关系和资源访问模式，识别可疑并发操作并通过三阶段验证流程测试确认并发错误。

Result: 在开源微服务基准测试中，MicroRacer能准确检测和定位并发问题。

Conclusion: MicroRacer是一种有效且高效的非侵入式自动化框架，可用于检测云服务系统中的并发错误。

Abstract: Modern cloud applications delivering global services are often built on distributed systems with a microservice architecture. In such systems, end-to-end user requests traverse multiple different services and machines, exhibiting intricate interactions. Consequently, cloud service systems are vulnerable to concurrency bugs, which pose significant challenges to their reliability. Existing methods for concurrency bug detection often fall short due to their intrusive nature and inability to handle the architectural complexities of microservices. To address these limitations, we propose MicroRacer, a non-intrusive and automated framework for detecting concurrency bugs in such environments. By dynamically instrumenting widely-used libraries at runtime, MicroRacer collects detailed trace data without modifying the application code. Such data are utilized to analyze the happened-before relationship and resource access patterns of common operations within service systems. Based on this information, MicroRacer identifies suspicious concurrent operations and employs a three-stage validation process to test and confirm concurrency bugs. Experiments on open-source microservice benchmarks with replicated industrial bugs demonstrate MicroRacer's effectiveness and efficiency in accurately detecting and pinpointing concurrency issues.

*Sairam Vaidya,Marcel Böhme,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出针对可扩展编译器的语法与覆盖引导模糊测试方法Germinator，在多个MLIR项目评估中提升覆盖度，发现众多未知漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代可扩展编译器框架灵活性高但难以确保正确性，现有自动测试生成方法难以兼顾方言无关性和方言有效性。

Method: 结合从方言规范自动提取语法和使用预训练大语言模型自动生成种子输入的思路，构建工具Germinator。

Result: 在六个MLIR项目91个方言上评估，生成的种子比基于语法的基线提高10 - 120%行覆盖率，发现88个未知漏洞（40个已确认）。

Conclusion: Germinator能有效且可控制地大规模测试资源少的方言。

Abstract: Modern extensible compiler frameworks-such as MLIR-enable rapid creation of domain-specific language dialects. This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.

Motivation: 改进现有基于傅里叶的方法，解决分支切割调整或经验调优阻尼参数问题，提供明确误差估计。

Method: 利用联合特征函数的连续可微表示提出卷积 - FFT方法，推导完全解析的误差界。

Result: 数值实验证实理论速率，能以适度计算成本实现稳健、高精度的期权定价。

Conclusion: 该方法在Heston模型下的欧洲期权定价中有效，是首个为该模型下基于FFT的卷积方法提供显式、封闭形式误差估计的工作。

Abstract: We propose a convolution-FFT method for pricing European options under the Heston model that leverages a continuously differentiable representation of the joint characteristic function. Unlike existing Fourier-based methods that rely on branch-cut adjustments or empirically tuned damping parameters, our approach yields a stable integrand even under large frequency oscillations. Crucially, we derive fully analytical error bounds that quantify both truncation error and discretization error in terms of model parameters and grid settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such explicit, closed-form error estimates for an FFT-based convolution method specialized to the Heston model. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robust, high-accuracy option pricing at modest computational cost.

Conclusion: 将QC作为系统关注点，框架为监管环境中可信、可扩展和合规的AI管道提供基础。

Abstract: In regulated domains such as finance, the integrity and governance of data pipelines are critical - yet existing systems treat data quality control (QC) as an isolated preprocessing step rather than a first-class system component. We present a unified AI-driven Data QC and DataOps Management framework that embeds rule-based, statistical, and AI-based QC methods into a continuous, governed layer spanning ingestion, model pipelines, and downstream applications. Our architecture integrates open-source tools with custom modules for profiling, audit logging, breach handling, configuration-driven policies, and dynamic remediation. We demonstrate deployment in a production-grade financial setup: handling streaming and tabular data across multiple asset classes and transaction streams, with configurable thresholds, cloud-native storage interfaces, and automated alerts. We show empirical gains in anomaly detection recall, reduction of manual remediation effort, and improved auditability and traceability in high-throughput data workflows. By treating QC as a system concern rather than an afterthought, our framework provides a foundation for trustworthy, scalable, and compliant AI pipelines in regulated environments.

Motivation: 引入DBN框架预测VaR和SVaR并与常见模型对比性能。

Method: 使用1991 - 2020年标普500指数日回报率，传统模型用滚动周期和历史回报率，三种DBN用历史和预测回报率，用标准回测和预测误差衡量模型预测准确性。

Result: 自回归模型VaR预测最准确，DBN和历史模拟模型表现相当；对于SVaR，所有模型预测保守，准确性差异小。

Conclusion: DBN虽未超越传统模型，但作为前瞻性方法为后续金融风险预测整合因果推断研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This study introduces a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) framework for forecasting value at risk (VaR) and stressed VaR (SVaR) and compares its performance to several commonly applied models. Using daily S&P 500 index returns from 1991 to 2020, we produce 10-day 99% VaR and SVaR forecasts using a rolling period and historical returns for the traditional models, while three DBNs use both historical and forecasted returns. We evaluate the models' forecasting accuracy using standard backtests and forecasting error measures. Results show that autoregressive models deliver the most accurate VaR forecasts, while the DBNs achieve comparable performance to the historical simulation model, despite incorporating forward-looking return forecasts. For SVaR, all models produce highly conservative forecasts, with minimal breaches and limited differentiation in accuracy. While DBNs do not outperform traditional models, they demonstrate feasibility as a forward-looking approach to provide a foundation for future research on integrating causal inference into financial risk forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发大语言模型的语义动力学通用理论，解释离散符号语义如何从连续计算中出现。

Method: 将大语言模型形式化为连续状态机，研究相关转移算子，在温和正则假设下分析其性质。

Result: 证明了语义表征定理，表明转移算子的主特征函数诱导出有限的不变意义谱盆地，连续激活流形可坍缩为有限、逻辑可解释的本体；将定理拓展到随机和绝热设置，表明缓慢漂移的核保持紧致性、谱相干性和盆地结构。

Conclusion: 离散符号语义可从连续计算中出现，该理论具有一定的拓展性和稳定性。

Abstract: We develop a general theory of semantic dynamics for large language models by formalizing them as Continuous State Machines (CSMs): smooth dynamical systems whose latent manifolds evolve under probabilistic transition operators. The associated transfer operator $P: L^2(M,μ) \to L^2(M,μ)$ encodes the propagation of semantic mass. Under mild regularity assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, bounded Jacobian), $P$ is compact with discrete spectrum. Within this setting, we prove the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT): the leading eigenfunctions of $P$ induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over $\mathbb{R}$. Thus spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide. This explains how discrete symbolic semantics can emerge from continuous computation: the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology. We further extend the SCT to stochastic and adiabatic (time-inhomogeneous) settings, showing that slowly drifting kernels preserve compactness, spectral coherence, and basin structure.

Motivation: 现有采样算法需多次迭代，计算成本高，且标准ELBO估计在少步情况下会退化。

Method: 学习步长条件ODE，通过状态空间一致性损失用大步长重现小步长轨迹；推导无反向核的确定性流（DF）重要性权重用于ELBO估计；引入体积一致性正则化校准DF。

Result: 在具有挑战性的合成和贝叶斯基准测试中，以少几个数量级的网络评估次数实现了有竞争力的样本质量，并保持了稳健的ELBO估计。

Conclusion: 所提出的采样器能在一步或几步内实现采样和稳定证据估计。

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and statistics. Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs. We introduce one-step diffusion samplers which learn a step-conditioned ODE so that one large step reproduces the trajectory of many small ones via a state-space consistency loss. We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel. To calibrate DF, we introduce a volume-consistency regularization that aligns the accumulated volume change along the flow across step resolutions. Our proposed sampler therefore achieves both sampling and stable evidence estimate in only one or few steps. Across challenging synthetic and Bayesian benchmarks, it achieves competitive sample quality with orders-of-magnitude fewer network evaluations while maintaining robust ELBO estimates.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the parameters of a $N$-dimensional stochastic linear dynamics under both full and partial observations from a single trajectory of time $T$. We introduce and analyze a new estimator that achieves a small maximum element-wise error on the recovery of symmetric dynamic matrices using only $T=\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ observations, irrespective of whether the matrix is sparse or dense. This estimator is based on the method of moments and does not rely on problem-specific regularization. This is especially important for applications such as structure discovery.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence and machine learning tools become more accessible, and scientists face new obstacles to data collection (e.g., rising costs, declining survey response rates), researchers increasingly use predictions from pre-trained algorithms as substitutes for missing or unobserved data. Though appealing for financial and logistical reasons, using standard tools for inference can misrepresent the association between independent variables and the outcome of interest when the true, unobserved outcome is replaced by a predicted value. In this paper, we characterize the statistical challenges inherent to drawing inference with predicted data (IPD) and show that high predictive accuracy does not guarantee valid downstream inference. We show that all such failures reduce to statistical notions of (i) bias, when predictions systematically shift the estimand or distort relationships among variables, and (ii) variance, when uncertainty from the prediction model and the intrinsic variability of the true data are ignored. We then review recent methods for conducting IPD and discuss how this framework is deeply rooted in classical statistical theory. We then comment on some open questions and interesting avenues for future work in this area, and end with some comments on how to use predicted data in scientific studies that is both transparent and statistically principled.

In particular, we introduce an optimal transport approach to alternating minimization called BalLOT, and we show that it delivers a fast and effective solution to this problem. We establish this with a variety of numerical experiments before proving several theoretical guarantees. First, we prove that for generic data, BalLOT produces integral couplings at each step. Next, we perform a landscape analysis to provide theoretical guarantees for both exact and partial recoveries of planted clusters under the stochastic ball model. Finally, we propose initialization schemes that achieve one-step recovery of planted clusters.

Abstract: We study the calibration of Gaussian process (GP) predictive distributions in the interpolation setting from a design-marginal perspective. Conditioning on the data and averaging over a design measure μ, we formalize μ-coverage for central intervals and μ-probabilistic calibration through randomized probability integral transforms. We introduce two methods. cps-gp adapts conformal predictive systems to GP interpolation using standardized leave-one-out residuals, yielding stepwise predictive distributions with finite-sample marginal calibration. bcr-gp retains the GP posterior mean and replaces the Gaussian residual by a generalized normal model fitted to cross-validated standardized residuals. A Bayesian selection rule-based either on a posterior upper quantile of the variance for conservative prediction or on a cross-posterior Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion for probabilistic calibration-controls dispersion and tail behavior while producing smooth predictive distributions suitable for sequential design. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions compare cps-gp, bcr-gp, Jackknife+ for GPs, and the full conformal Gaussian process, using calibration metrics (coverage, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, integral absolute error) and accuracy or sharpness through the scaled continuous ranked probability score.

Conclusion: 核基和局部自适应算法可在统一框架下分析，LP - GP - UCB算法虽不全面优于专业方法，但在多核族上有良好表现。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the relationship between kernel regularity and algorithmic performance in the bandit optimization of RKHS functions. While reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods traditionally rely on global kernel regressors, it is also common to use a smoothness-based approach that exploits local approximations. We show that these perspectives are deeply connected through the spectral properties of isotropic kernels. In particular, we characterize the Fourier spectra of the Matérn, square-exponential, rational-quadratic, $γ$-exponential, piecewise-polynomial, and Dirichlet kernels, and show that the decay rate determines asymptotic regret from both viewpoints. For kernelized bandit algorithms, spectral decay yields upper bounds on the maximum information gain, governing worst-case regret, while for smoothness-based methods, the same decay rates establish Hölder space embeddings and Besov space norm-equivalences, enabling local continuity analysis. These connections show that kernel-based and locally adaptive algorithms can be analyzed within a unified framework. This allows us to derive explicit regret bounds for each kernel family, obtaining novel results in several cases and providing improved analysis for others. Furthermore, we analyze LP-GP-UCB, an algorithm that combines both approaches, augmenting global Gaussian process surrogates with local polynomial estimators. While the hybrid approach does not uniformly dominate specialized methods, it achieves order-optimality across multiple kernel families.

Abstract: Reasoning from diverse observations is a fundamental capability for generalist robot policies to operate in a wide range of environments. Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

Abstract: As mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans in shared workspaces, ensuring safe, efficient, and interpretable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a pressing challenge. While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory planning framework for UAVs operating under adversarial jamming conditions. Leveraging Bayesian Active Inference, the approach combines expert-generated demonstrations with probabilistic generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning, low-level motion policies, and wireless signal feedback. During deployment, the UAV performs online inference to anticipate interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory accordingly, without prior knowledge of jammer locations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Robotic systems are transforming image-guided interventions by enhancing accuracy and minimizing radiation exposure. A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.

TL;DR: 提出训练时实时分块（RTC）方法替代推理时修复方法，减少推理开销，实验证明其在高延迟下表现更好且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时分块（RTC）的推理时修复方法会增加推理延迟，需降低计算开销。

Method: 在训练时模拟推理延迟并直接基于动作前缀进行条件设定，无需修改模型架构和机器人运行时。

Result: 模拟实验中，训练时RTC在高推理延迟下优于推理时RTC；真实世界实验中，训练时RTC性能和速度与推理时RTC相当且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 训练时动作条件设定可作为实时机器人控制中推理时修复的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Real-time chunking (RTC) enables vision-language-action models (VLAs) to generate smooth, reactive robot trajectories by asynchronously predicting action chunks and conditioning on previously committed actions via inference-time inpainting. However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper. Our results suggest that training-time action conditioning is a practical drop-in replacement for inference-time inpainting in real-time robot control.

TL;DR: 提出无训练加速方法InvarDiff，利用特征不变性进行缓存，在DiT和FLUX上减少冗余计算，实现2 - 3倍加速且不影响质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型合成质量高但采样慢，需加速方法。

Method: 利用确定性采样中的特征不变性，计算缓存计划矩阵，采用重采样校正避免漂移，进行跨时间步和层的缓存。

Result: 应用于DiT和FLUX时，实现2 - 3倍端到端加速，标准质量指标影响小，视觉质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: InvarDiff能有效加速扩散模型采样，同时保持合成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver high-fidelity synthesis but remain slow due to iterative sampling. We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics. Qualitatively, we observe almost no degradation in visual quality compared with full computations.

Motivation: 从粗尺度输入重建高分辨率卫星图像，改进环境暴露评估和长期环境监测。

Method: 结合轻量级U - Net迁移编码器与扩散生成模型，先在粗分辨率数据预训练U - Net，冻结其编码器并迁移到降尺度模型；将研究区域按季节和子区域划分；用Wasserstein距离进行域相似性分析。

Conclusion: 迁移增强扩散模型为有限训练期内粗分辨率图像降尺度提供了稳健且物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a transfer-learning generative downscaling framework to reconstruct fine resolution satellite images from coarse scale inputs. Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.

Result: 在场景和物体级基准测试中，AREA3D实现了最先进的重建精度，尤其是在稀疏视图情况下。

Conclusion: 提出的AREA3D可有效解决现有主动重建方法的局限，提升重建精度。

Abstract: Active 3D reconstruction enables an agent to autonomously select viewpoints to efficiently obtain accurate and complete scene geometry, rather than passively reconstructing scenes from pre-collected images. However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime. Code will be made available at: https://github.com/TianlingXu/AREA3D .

Conclusion: 频率表示学习可有效缓解尺度锚定问题，适用于零样本超分辨率时空预测。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Super-Resolution Spatiotemporal Forecasting requires a deep learning model to be trained on low-resolution data and deployed for inference on high-resolution. Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: AI-ECG模型在预测冠状动脉狭窄上有良好性能、稳定性和可解释性，为冠心病筛查提供新途径。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major global health burden. Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability. Risk stratification based on vessel-specific incidence thresholds showed consistent separation on calibration and cumulative event curves. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups, highlighting key electrophysiological regions contributing to model decisions and offering new insights into the ECG correlates of coronary stenosis.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal understanding, yet still struggle when targets are embedded in cluttered backgrounds requiring figure-ground segregation. To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes. ChromouVQA provides a compact, controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation and extension. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Chromou-VQA-Benchmark/Chromou-VQA.

Abstract: The increasing availability of Earth observation data offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. However, these datasets are inherently heterogeneous, stemming from diverse sensors, geographical regions, acquisition times, and atmospheric conditions. Distribution shifts between training and deployment domains severely limit the generalization of pretrained remote sensing models, making unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) crucial for real-world applications. We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowEO outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality, highlighting the potential of flow-matching-based UDA for remote sensing.

Abstract: The growing exploration of Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision-Language Models (VLM) has opened avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing LLM-based RL methods often focus on the guidance of control policy and encounter the challenge of limited representations of the backbone networks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released.

Abstract: Temporal understanding in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, even for recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD. The benchmark and evaluation code are available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/vbdai/TAD}{Hugging Face} and \href{https://github.com/vbdi/tad_bench}{Github}, respectively.

Abstract: Generative methods for 3D assets have recently achieved remarkable progress, yet providing intuitive and precise control over the object geometry remains a key challenge. Existing approaches predominantly rely on text or image prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduce SpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range of geometric inputs, from coarse primitives to detailed meshes, and integrates seamlessly with modern pre-trained generative models without requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off between geometric fidelity and output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality. Finally, we present an interactive user interface that enables online editing of superquadrics for direct conversion into textured 3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows.

Abstract: One of the greatest challenges for detecting moving objects in the solar system from wide-field survey data is determining whether a signal indicates a true object or is due to some other source, like noise. Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.

Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning (WAFL) has been proposed as a promising approach for collaborative learning with device-to-device communication among edges. In particular, WAFL with Vision Transformer (WAFL-ViT) has been tested on image recognition tasks with the UTokyo Building Recognition Dataset (UTBR). Since WAFL-ViT is a mission-oriented sensor system, it is essential to construct specific datasets by each mission. In our work, we have developed the Chulalongkorn University Building Recognition Dataset (CUBR), which is specialized for Chulalongkorn University as a case study in Thailand. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that training on WAFL scenarios achieves better accuracy than self-training scenarios. Dataset is available in https://github.com/jo2lxq/wafl/.

Conclusion: UniFS模型有效解决现有方法局限，有良好泛化性能，代码公开。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-Contrast MR Reconstruction (MCMR) has emerged as a hot research topic that leverages high-quality auxiliary modalities to reconstruct undersampled target modalities of interest. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS.

*Rowan Bradbury,Dazhi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PELC原理与DecFormer变压器进行潜在图像修复，降低误差，PELC可用于通用潜在编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的潜在修复方法存在问题，如线性插值会产生伪影和颜色偏移。

Method: 提出像素等效潜在合成（PELC）原理，引入DecFormer变压器预测融合权重和残差校正。

Result: 在FLUX.1系列上还原全局颜色一致性等，边缘误差降低最多53%，轻量级LoRA模型达到高保真度。

Conclusion: PELC是通用的像素等效潜在编辑方法，DecFormer能有效改善潜在修复质量。

Abstract: Latent inpainting in diffusion models still relies almost universally on linearly interpolating VAE latents under a downsampled mask. We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无训练框架DepSeg用于腹腔镜场景像素分割，利用单目深度和预训练视觉基础模型，在CholecSeg8k数据集上表现好，证明该方法注解效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜场景像素分割因密集注解成本高难以扩展，需更高效方法。

Method: DepSeg先通过预训练单目深度估计网络估计相对深度图，提出深度引导点提示，用SAM2转换为无类别掩码，再用预训练视觉特征描述并通过模板匹配分类。

Result: 在CholecSeg8k数据集上，DepSeg的mIoU为35.9%，优于直接SAM2自动分割基线的14.7%，使用10 - 20%对象模板时仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 深度引导提示和基于模板的分类提供了一种注解高效的分割方法。

Abstract: Pixel-wise segmentation of laparoscopic scenes is essential for computer-assisted surgery but difficult to scale due to the high cost of dense annotations. We propose depth-guided surgical scene segmentation (DepSeg), a training-free framework that utilizes monocular depth as a geometric prior together with pretrained vision foundation models. DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames. On the CholecSeg8k dataset, DepSeg improves over a direct SAM2 auto segmentation baseline (35.9% vs. 14.7% mIoU) and maintains competitive performance even when using only 10--20% of the object templates. These results show that depth-guided prompting and template-based classification offer an annotation-efficient segmentation approach.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型存在文本惯性导致对象幻觉，现有解码策略和内控方法有局限性。

Method: 引入无训练的推理时框架CG - VLM，用基于Harsanyi交互的认知需求传感器估计视觉 - 文本协同性，聚焦共识诱导模块在注意力偏向文本先验前重新引导中层注意力到视觉标记。

Result: 在多个模型上的POPE和CHAIR任务中取得SOTA结果，同时保留通用能力。

Conclusion: 标记级别的感知能实现精确、上下文感知的干预，且不损害基础知识。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often exhibit text inertia, where attention drifts from visual evidence toward linguistic priors, resulting in object hallucinations. Existing decoding strategies intervene only at the output logits and thus cannot correct internal reasoning drift, while recent internal-control methods based on heuristic head suppression or global steering vectors lack principled grounding. We introduce Conscious Gaze (CG-VLM), a training-free, inference-time framework that converts game-theoretic interpretability into actionable decoding control. A Cognitive Demand Sensor built on Harsanyi interactions estimates instantaneous vision-text synergy and identifies moments when visual grounding is necessary. Conditioned on this signal, a Focused Consensus Induction module selectively reorients mid-layer attention toward visual tokens before collapse into text priors. CG-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on POPE and CHAIR across InstructBLIP, LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG, while preserving general capabilities, demonstrating that token-level sensing enables precise, context-aware intervention without compromising foundational knowledge.

Abstract: Sequential identity consistency under precise transient attribute control remains a long-standing challenge in controllable visual storytelling. Existing datasets lack sufficient fidelity and fail to disentangle stable identities from transient attributes, limiting structured control over pose, expression, and scene composition and thus constraining reliable sequential synthesis. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{2K-Characters-10K-Stories}, a multi-modal stylized narrative dataset of \textbf{2{,}000} uniquely stylized characters appearing across \textbf{10{,}000} illustration stories. It is the first dataset that pairs large-scale unique identities with explicit, decoupled control signals for sequential identity consistency. We introduce a \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop pipeline (HiL)} that leverages expert-verified character templates and LLM-guided narrative planning to generate highly-aligned structured data. A \textbf{decoupled control} scheme separates persistent identity from transient attributes -- pose and expression -- while a \textbf{Quality-Gated loop} integrating MMLM evaluation, Auto-Prompt Tuning, and Local Image Editing enforces pixel-level consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset achieves performance comparable to closed-source models in generating visual narratives.

Method: 引入PoolNet这一深度学习框架进行帧级和场景级验证。

Result: 模型能成功区分适合和不适合SfM处理的场景，且获取SfM数据的时间显著低于现有算法。

Conclusion: PoolNet框架有效解决了从图像数据中提取SfM信息的问题。

Abstract: Lifting Structure-from-Motion (SfM) information from sequential and non-sequential image data is a time-consuming and computationally expensive task. In addition to this, the majority of publicly available data is unfit for processing due to inadequate camera pose variation, obscuring scene elements, and noisy data. To solve this problem, we introduce PoolNet, a versatile deep learning framework for frame-level and scene-level validation of in-the-wild data. We demonstrate that our model successfully differentiates SfM ready scenes from those unfit for processing while significantly undercutting the amount of time state of the art algorithms take to obtain structure-from-motion data.

Conclusion: InverseCrafter是一个高效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent approaches to controllable 4D video generation often rely on fine-tuning pre-trained Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). This dominant paradigm is computationally expensive, requiring large-scale datasets and architectural modifications, and frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the model's original generative priors. Here, we propose InverseCrafter, an efficient inpainting inverse solver that reformulates the 4D generation task as an inpainting problem solved in the latent space. The core of our method is a principled mechanism to encode the pixel space degradation operator into a continuous, multi-channel latent mask, thereby bypassing the costly bottleneck of repeated VAE operations and backpropagation. InverseCrafter not only achieves comparable novel view generation and superior measurement consistency in camera control tasks with near-zero computational overhead, but also excels at general-purpose video inpainting with editing.

Conclusion: DashFusion框架有效解决多模态情感分析的对齐和融合问题，能提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates various modalities, such as text, image, and audio, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques. The codes for our experiments are available at https://github.com/ultramarineX/DashFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频理解框架依赖查询无关的字幕生成器，浪费计算资源且模糊时空信息，基于主动感知理论，应让长视频理解代理主动决定观察内容、时间和位置。

Method: 提出AVP框架，与多模态大语言模型（MLLM）代理进行迭代的计划 - 观察 - 反思过程。

Result: 在五个长视频理解基准测试中取得最高性能，平均准确率比最佳代理方法高5.7%，推理时间仅需18.4%，输入令牌仅需12.4%。

Conclusion: AVP框架在长视频理解任务中表现出色，能有效提高性能和效率。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理任务存在局限，现有方法如MindJourney虽有尝试但效果待察，需系统研究测试时验证器的表现。

Method: 对测试时验证器在基准测试中的表现进行不确定性分析，提出Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA)框架。

Result: MindJourney验证器校准不足，随机评分效果相当；ViSA框架在SAT - Real基准测试提升空间推理能力，纠正轨迹选择偏差；在MMSI - Bench上所有验证器均未实现持续扩展。

Conclusion: 总结了基于世界模型推理的测试时验证的优缺点，当前世界模型存在信息瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

Abstract: This study focuses on event detection in optical fibers, specifically classifying six events using the Phase-OTDR system. A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot.

The proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracies of 98.84% and 98.24% with the EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 models, respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirms the reliability of these models, with test accuracy rates of 99.07% and 98.68%. Using a publicly available Phase-OTDR dataset, the study demonstrates an efficient approach to understanding optical fiber events while reducing dataset size and improving analysis efficiency. The results highlight the transformative potential of image-based analysis in interpreting complex fiber optic sensing data, offering significant advancements in the accuracy and reliability of fiber optic monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 一个设计良好的正则化项可超越复杂的多约束公式，单约束有时更有效。

Abstract: When depth sensors provide only 5% of needed measurements, reconstructing complete 3D scenes becomes difficult. Autonomous vehicles and robots cannot tolerate the geometric errors that sparse reconstruction introduces. We propose curvature regularization through a discrete Laplacian operator, achieving 18.1% better reconstruction accuracy than standard variational autoencoders. Our contribution challenges an implicit assumption in geometric deep learning: that combining multiple geometric constraints improves performance. A single well-designed regularization term not only matches but exceeds the effectiveness of complex multi-term formulations. The discrete Laplacian offers stable gradients and noise suppression with just 15% training overhead and zero inference cost.

Conclusion: C3方法可有效解决可控视频模型的幻觉问题，提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.

Abstract: Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].

Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity. This work provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures.

Abstract: Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Underwater images often suffer from severe color distortion, low contrast, and a hazy appearance due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering. Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 介绍NVLang语言，为BEAM虚拟机带来类型安全，消除消息传递错误，可与Erlang生态系统互操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Actor系统缺乏消息协议的静态保证，协议违规会导致生产故障。

Method: 使用代数数据类型编码消息协议，引入类型化进程标识符和类型化期货，扩展Hindley - Milner类型推断。

Result: 实现编译为Core Erlang，可与现有Erlang生态系统无缝互操作，形式化类型系统并给出类型健全性证明。

Conclusion: NVLang能消除消息传递错误，保证不会发送违反Actor协议的消息。

Abstract: Actor-based systems like Erlang/OTP power critical infrastructure -- from telecommunications to messaging platforms -- handling millions of concurrent connections with legendary reliability. Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures.
  We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns.
  By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem. We formalize the type system and provide proof sketches for type soundness, demonstrating that well-typed NVLang programs cannot send messages that violate actor protocols.

<details>

Motivation: 不确定AoS和精度转换应在CPU还是GPU执行，以及数据在计算前流到加速器是否有利，希望优化数据布局转换。

Method: 引入编译器注释来促进数据布局转换和GPU卸载协同进行。

Result: 对于部分关注的计算内核，Nvidia的G200平台加速比约2.6，AMD的MI300A性能更稳健但加速效果较小。

Conclusion: 基于编译器的技术适用于多种拉格朗日代码及其他情况。

Abstract: This study evaluates AoS-to-SoA transformations over reduced-precision data layouts for a particle simulation code on several GPU platforms: We hypothesize that SoA fits particularly well to SIMT, while AoS is the preferred storage format for many Lagrangian codes. Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less. We assume that our compiler-based techniques are applicable to a wide variety of Lagrangian codes and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出静态、编译器集成方法减少动态数据竞争检测器的运行时开销，实验显示显著提升检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态数据竞争检测器运行时开销高，主要源于内存访问的冗余插桩。

Method: 引入一系列过程间静态分析，消除无竞争访问的插桩；定义等价概念，用基于支配的消除分析消除冗余检查；在LLVM中实现五个静态分析并与ThreadSanitizer集成。

Result: 实验表明显著降低竞争检测开销，几何平均加速比1.34x，峰值2.5x，编译时间增加可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少检测开销，已被ThreadSanitizer维护者接受并将上游集成。

Abstract: Dynamic data race detectors are indispensable for flagging concurrency errors in software, but their high runtime overhead limits their adoption. This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention. This performance is achieved with a negligible increase in compilation time and, being fully automatic, places no additional burden on developers. Our optimizations have been accepted by the ThreadSanitizer maintainers and are in the process of being upstreamed.

Motivation: 二阶优化方法虽好，但二阶信息矩阵求逆成本高阻碍其实际应用，需解决该问题。

Method: 使用基于阻变随机存取存储器（RRAM）的内存模拟矩阵计算（AMC）实现二阶优化器，一步完成矩阵求逆，并通过训练两层卷积神经网络（CNN）验证。

Result: 在手写字母分类任务中，比带动量的SGD和Adam减少训练轮数；在更大任务中，吞吐量提高5.88倍，能效提高6.9倍。

Conclusion: AMC电路用于二阶神经网络训练可行且有效，为节能AI加速开辟新路径。

Abstract: Second-order optimization methods, which leverage curvature information, offer faster and more stable convergence than first-order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam. However, their practical adoption is hindered by the prohibitively high cost of inverting the second-order information matrix, particularly in large-scale neural network training. Here, we present the first demonstration of a second-order optimizer powered by in-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) using resistive random-access memory (RRAM), which performs matrix inversion (INV) in a single step. We validate the optimizer by training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten letter classification, achieving 26% and 61% fewer training epochs than SGD with momentum and Adam, respectively. On a larger task using the same second-order method, our system delivers a 5.88x improvement in throughput and a 6.9x gain in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of AMC circuits for second-order neural network training, opening a new path toward energy-efficient AI acceleration.

Result: 多行星数据训练有前景，单行星数据覆盖范围小，对未包含在训练数据中的行星属性外推效果不佳。

Conclusion: 扩展到行星系统因问题维度高，需要更多训练数据。

Abstract: The interpretation of the origin of observed exoplanets is usually done only qualitatively due to uncertainties of key parameters in planet formation models. To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem.

Motivation: 传统衡量老龄化质量指标忽视无病时生理能力逐渐下降问题，需新指标量化老龄化质量及社会经济影响。

Method: 引入Peakspan概念并进行多系统分析。

Result: 多数生物系统成年早期达最大容量，Peakspan相对总寿命短，人类成年多数时间处于‘健康但能力下降’状态。

Conclusion: 延长Peakspan和恢复峰值后个体功能对老龄化社会经济增长至关重要，识别追踪Peakspan利于开发策略压缩功能发病率和发挥人类潜力。

Abstract: The unprecedented extension of the human lifespan necessitates a parallel evolution in how we quantify the quality of aging and its socioeconomic impact. Traditional metrics focusing on Healthspan (years free of disease) overlook the gradual erosion of physiological capacity that occurs even in the absence of illness, leading to declines in productivity and eventual lack of capacity to work. To address this critical gap, we introduce Peakspan: the age interval during which an individual maintains at least 90% of their peak functional performance in a specific physiological or cognitive domain. Our multi-system analysis reveals a profound misalignment: most biological systems reach maximal capacity in early adulthood, resulting in a Peakspan that is remarkably short relative to the total lifespan. This dissociation means humans now spend the majority of their adult lives in a "healthy but declined" state, characterized by a significant functional gap. We argue that extending Peakspan and developing strategies to restore function in post-peak individuals is the functional manifestation of rejuvenative biomedical progress and is essential for sustained economic growth in aging societies. Recognizing and tracking Peakspan, increasingly facilitated by artificial intelligence and foundational models of biological aging, is crucial for developing strategies to compress functional morbidity and maximize human potential across the life course.

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings. To address these challenges, we propose SyncVoice, a vision-augmented video dubbing framework built upon a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.

Conclusion: 整合语义和结构信息对稳健且适应性强的蛋白质功能预测很有用。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein function is essential for elucidating molecular mechanisms and advancing biological and therapeutic discovery. Yet experimental annotation lags far behind the rapid growth of protein sequence data. Computational approaches address this gap by associating proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which encode functional knowledge through hierarchical relations and textual definitions. However, existing models often emphasize one modality over the other, limiting their ability to generalize, particularly to unseen or newly introduced GO terms that frequently arise as the ontology evolves, and making the previously trained models outdated. We present STAR-GO, a Transformer-based framework that jointly models the semantic and structural characteristics of GO terms to enhance zero-shot protein function prediction. STAR-GO integrates textual definitions with ontology graph structure to learn unified GO representations, which are processed in hierarchical order to propagate information from general to specific terms. These representations are then aligned with protein sequence embeddings to capture sequence-function relationships. STAR-GO achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior zero-shot generalization, demonstrating the utility of integrating semantics and structure for robust and adaptable protein function prediction.

Conclusion: 可以使用机器学习从结构图像中自动识别和分类关键摩擦学变形特征，为构建摩擦学机制图和预测模型框架奠定基础。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become indispensable for exploring tribological deformation patterns at the atomic scale. However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education and the workforce, but access to AI learning opportunities in Africa remains uneven. With rapid demographic shifts and growing labour market pressures, AI has become a strategic development priority, making the demand for relevant skills more urgent. This study investigates how universities and industries engage in shaping AI education and workforce preparation, drawing on survey responses from five African countries (Ghana, Namibia, Rwanda, Kenya and Zambia). The findings show broad recognition of AI importance but limited evidence of consistent engagement, practical training, or equitable access to resources. Most respondents who rated the AI component of their curriculum as very relevant reported being well prepared for jobs, but financial barriers, poor infrastructure, and weak communication limit participation, especially among students and underrepresented groups. Respondents highlighted internships, industry partnerships, and targeted support mechanisms as critical enablers, alongside the need for inclusive governance frameworks. The results showed both the growing awareness of AI's potential and the structural gaps that hinder its translation into workforce capacity. Strengthening university-industry collaboration and addressing barriers of access, funding, and policy are central to ensuring that AI contributes to equitable and sustainable development across the continent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into computational social science research, yet their blackboxed training and designed stochastic elements in inference pose unique challenges for scientific inquiry. This article argues that applying LLMs to social scientific tasks requires explicit assessment of uncertainty-an expectation long established in both quantitative methodology in the social sciences and machine learning. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating LLM uncertainty along two dimensions: the task type (T), which distinguishes between classification, short-form, and long-form generation, and the validation type (V), which captures the availability of reference data or evaluative criteria. Drawing from both computer science and social science literature, we map existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods to this T-V typology and offer practical recommendations for researchers. Our framework provides both a methodological safeguard and a practical guide for integrating LLMs into rigorous social science research.

Abstract: In numerous applications, surrogate models are used as a replacement for accurate parameter-to-observable mappings when solving large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态博弈方法在大规模场景计算Nash均衡有挑战，平均场博弈近似有局限性，需设计适用于大规模CAV的控制策略。

Method: 提出α - 势博弈框架，将计算α - NE转化为分散式控制问题，推导参数α的边界，开发基于分散式神经网络策略的可扩展策略梯度算法。

Result: 该框架能适应不同交通流模型，有效捕捉避撞、避障和代理异质性。

Conclusion: 所提出的α - 势博弈框架可用于解决大规模CAV的分散式控制问题。

Abstract: Designing scalable and safe control strategies for large populations of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) requires accounting for strategic interactions among heterogeneous agents under decentralized information. While dynamic games provide a natural modeling framework, computing Nash equilibria (NEs) in large-scale settings remains challenging, and existing mean-field game approximations rely on restrictive assumptions that fail to capture collision avoidance and heterogeneous behaviors. This paper proposes an $α$-potential game framework for decentralized CAV control. We show that computing $α$-NE reduces to solving a decentralized control problem, and derive tight bounds of the parameter $α$ based on interaction intensity and asymmetry. We further develop scalable policy gradient algorithms for computing $α$-NEs using decentralized neural-network policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework accommodates diverse traffic flow models and effectively captures collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and agent heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注歌词在预测音乐流行度中的作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用LLM提取歌词高维嵌入，集成到多模态架构HitMusicLyricNet中，结合音频、歌词和社交元数据预测流行度。

Result: 在SpotGenTrack数据集上优于现有基线，MAE和MSE分别提升9%和20%。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的歌词特征流程（LyricsAENet）有价值，密集歌词表示有助于提升预测效果。

Abstract: Accurately predicting music popularity is a critical challenge in the music industry, offering benefits to artists, producers, and streaming platforms. Prior research has largely focused on audio features, social metadata, or model architectures. This work addresses the under-explored role of lyrics in predicting popularity. We present an automated pipeline that uses LLM to extract high-dimensional lyric embeddings, capturing semantic, syntactic, and sequential information. These features are integrated into HitMusicLyricNet, a multimodal architecture that combines audio, lyrics, and social metadata for popularity score prediction in the range 0-100. Our method outperforms existing baselines on the SpotGenTrack dataset, which contains over 100,000 tracks, achieving 9% and 20% improvements in MAE and MSE, respectively. Ablation confirms that gains arise from our LLM-driven lyrics feature pipeline (LyricsAENet), underscoring the value of dense lyric representations.

Motivation: 了解不同uMLIPs学到了什么，以及训练集和训练协议对其的影响。

Method: 用特征重建误差定量评估uMLIPs潜在特征的相对信息内容，观察训练集和训练协议的选择对趋势的影响。

Result: uMLIPs编码化学空间的方式显著不同，同一模型架构的变体趋势依赖于数据集、目标和训练协议，微调保留了潜在特征中的强预训练偏差。

Conclusion: 可通过渐进累积量的串联将MLIPs直接输出的原子级特征压缩为全局结构级特征。

Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors as metrics, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that the uMLIPs encode chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems aim to transmit task-relevant information between devices capable of artificial intelligence, but their performance can degrade when heterogeneous transmitter-receiver models produce misaligned latent representations. Existing semantic alignment methods typically rely on additional digital processing at the transmitter or receiver, increasing overall device complexity. In this work, we introduce the first over-the-air semantic alignment framework based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), which enables latent-space alignment directly in the wave domain, reducing substantially the computational burden at the device level. We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values.

Abstract: Accurate real-time waypoints estimation for the UAV-based online Terrain Following during wildfire patrol missions is critical to ensuring flight safety and enabling wildfire detection. However, existing real-time filtering algorithms struggle to maintain accurate waypoints under measurement noise in nonlinear and time-varying systems, posing risks of flight instability and missed wildfire detections during UAV-based terrain following. To address this issue, a Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares (RVM-RLS) filter, guided by a Residual Variance Matching Estimation (RVME) criterion, is proposed to adaptively estimate the real-time waypoints of nonlinear, time-varying UAV-based terrain following systems. The proposed method is validated using a UAV-based online terrain following system within a simulated terrain environment. Experimental results show that the RVM-RLS filter improves waypoints estimation accuracy by approximately 88$\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics. These findings demonstrate both the methodological advances in real-time filtering and the practical potential of the RVM-RLS filter for UAV-based online wildfire patrol.

Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective countermeasures. In this paper, we utilize a two-times-two patch antenna system (i.e., the software defined radio device Ettus USRP X440) to predict the angle, elevation, and distance to the jamming source based on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples. We propose to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the antenna system to predict the relative movement of the antenna in dynamic scenarios. We present a synthetic aperture system that enables coherent spatial imaging using platform motion to synthesize larger virtual apertures, offering superior angular resolution without mechanically rotating antennas. While classical angle-of-arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors, we utilize a methodology that fuses IQ and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms with 22 AoA features and the predicted relative movement to enhance GNSS jammer direction finding.

Motivation: 在特定领域应用中，人工智能系统面临训练数据有限问题，数据稀缺导致认知不确定性，限制预测性能。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论，强调信息论视角在量化数据稀缺影响中的作用。

Abstract: In context-specific applications such as robotics, telecommunications, and healthcare, artificial intelligence systems often face the challenge of limited training data. This scarcity introduces epistemic uncertainty, i.e., reducible uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the underlying data distribution, which fundamentally limits predictive performance. This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data. Throughout, we take an information-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role of information measures in quantifying the impact of data scarcity.

Result: 开展了为DBMS开发可移植DFC实例的早期工作。

Conclusion: 提出系统应支持DFC并原生执行策略，为代理生态系统的DFC研究制定了更广泛的议程。

Abstract: The promise of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is to perform complex, stateful tasks. This promise is stunted by significant risks - policy violations, process corruption, and security flaws - that stem from the lack of visibility and mechanisms to manage undesirable data flows produced by agent actions. Today, agent workflows are responsible for enforcing these policies in ad hoc ways. Just as data validation and access controls shifted from the application to the DBMS, freeing application developers from these concerns, we argue that systems should support Data Flow Controls (DFCs) and enforce DFC policies natively. This paper describes early work developing a portable instance of DFC for DBMSes and outlines a broader research agenda toward DFC for agent ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意WebShell威胁大，当前WebShell检测多为被动，WebShell家族分类自动化是有前景的方向但研究少，依赖人工分析。

Method: 提取动态函数调用轨迹，用大语言模型合成新变体扩充数据集，将扩充后的轨迹抽象为序列、图和树，对多种表征方法进行基准测试。

Result: 在四个真实数据集的监督和无监督设置下进行广泛实验。

Conclusion: 建立了自动化WebShell家族分类的鲁棒基线，为该挑战提供了数据抽象、表征模型和学习范式的有效组合的实用见解。

Abstract: Malicious WebShells pose a significant and evolving threat by compromising critical digital infrastructures and endangering public services in sectors such as healthcare and finance. While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on four real-world, family-annotated datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings, we establish a robust baseline and provide practical insights into the most effective combinations of data abstractions, representation models, and learning paradigms for this challenge.

TL;DR: 指出预填充攻击可绕过前沿大语言模型安全对齐，现有数据增强防御方法不足，提出Rank - Assisted Prefilling (RAP)攻击，又提出PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO)修复方法，提升模型抗攻击能力且对实用性影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强的监督微调防御方法实现的“深度”安全对齐不够有效，模型存在漏洞，需寻找更好的实现深度安全对齐的方法。

Method: 提出RAP攻击验证现有方法漏洞；提出基于匹配目标分布词元排名的新视角，在此基础上提出PRESTO方法修复数据增强防御。

Result: 在三种流行开源大语言模型上，添加PRESTO后在RAP攻击下平均StrongREJECT分数最多提升4.7倍，对模型实用性影响小。

Conclusion: 现有数据增强防御的深度安全对齐存在问题，PRESTO方法能有效提升模型在攻击下的安全性，且对模型实用性影响低。

Abstract: A frustratingly easy technique known as the prefilling attack has been shown to effectively circumvent the safety alignment of frontier LLMs by simply prefilling the assistant response with an affirmative prefix before decoding. In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the "deep" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability "harmful" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability "refusal" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the "gaming" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO). Adding PRESTO yields up to a 4.7x improvement in the mean StrongREJECT score under RAP attacks across three popular open-source LLMs, with low impact to model utility.

Conclusion: Omega系统能有效保障AI代理安全，实现端到端隔离、跨主体信任和监督交互，适用于云规模部署。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly deployed as cloud services that autonomously access sensitive data, invoke external tools, and interact with other agents. However, these agents run within a complex multi-party ecosystem, where untrusted components can lead to data leakage, tampering, or unintended behavior. Existing Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide only per binary protection and offer no guarantees for cross-principal trust, accelerator-level isolation, or supervised agent behavior. We present Omega, a system that enables trusted AI agents by enforcing end-to-end isolation, establishing verifiable trust across all contributing principals, and supervising every external interaction with accountable provenance. Omega builds on Confidential VMs and Confidential GPUs to create a Trusted Agent Platform that hosts many agents within a single CVM using nested isolation. It also provides efficient multi-agent orchestration with cross-principal trust establishment via differential attestation, and a policy specification and enforcement framework that governs data access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication for data protection and regulatory compliance. Implemented on AMD SEV-SNP and NVIDIA H100, Omega fully secures agent state across CVM-GPU, and achieves high performance while enabling high-density, policy-compliant multi-agent deployments at cloud scale.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效降低双调和距离计算复杂度，提升计算速度。

Abstract: The biharmonic distance is a fundamental metric on graphs that measures the dissimilarity between two nodes, capturing both local and global structures. It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L >= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show that our method delivers 10x-1000x per-query speedups at matched relative error over strong baselines and scales to graphs with tens of millions of nodes.

Abstract: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.

Abstract: As AI-generated video platforms rapidly advance, ethical challenges such as copyright infringement emerge. This study examines how users make sense of AI-generated videos on OpenAI's Sora by conducting a qualitative content analysis of user comments. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four dynamics that characterize how users negotiate authenticity, authorship, and platform governance on Sora. First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems. Based on the findings, we discuss governance challenges in Sora and how user negotiations inform future platform governance.

The platform's capabilities are demonstrated using synthetic EHR datasets and computed tomography (CT)-derived spine models processed through an AI-powered segmentation pipeline. This work suggests that such integrated XR solutions could form the foundation for next-generation clinical decision-support tools, where advanced data infrastructures are directly accessible in an interactive and spatially rich environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有方法在生成3D面部动画方面的关键局限。

Method: 引入DSEE提取时频域音频特征进行细粒度情感分析，用ESMM基于声纹特征建模个人表达模式，利用新构建的3D - EmoStyle数据集解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: PESTalk在生成逼真和个性化面部动画方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PESTalk是一种有效的生成3D面部动画的新方法。

Abstract: PESTalk is a novel method for generating 3D facial animations with personalized emotional styles directly from speech. It overcomes key limitations of existing approaches by introducing a Dual-Stream Emotion Extractor (DSEE) that captures both time and frequency-domain audio features for fine-grained emotion analysis, and an Emotional Style Modeling Module (ESMM) that models individual expression patterns based on voiceprint characteristics. To address data scarcity, the method leverages a newly constructed 3D-EmoStyle dataset. Evaluations demonstrate that PESTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing realistic and personalized facial animations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前不清楚行业资助论文数量、引用影响及行业兴趣驱动因素，本研究填补该空白。

Method: 分析1998 - 2022年Scopus中约49.8K篇论文、约1.8M条AI论文间引用和约2.3M条其他论文对AI论文引用，通过七个研究问题进行研究。

Result: 2015年后行业资助占比从不足2%升至2020年超11%；2018 - 2022年，行业资助论文高引用率高于非资助论文；顶级AI会议更青睐行业资助研究；行业资助研究更封闭。

Conclusion: AI研究资助呈现向行业资助论文倾斜、引用影响增大、行业资助工作更封闭、偏好引用近期工作等新趋势。

Abstract: Over the past four decades, artificial intelligence (AI) research has flourished at the nexus of academia and industry. However, Big Tech companies have increasingly acquired the edge in computational resources, big data, and talent. So far, it has been largely unclear how many papers the industry funds, how their citation impact compares to non-funded papers, and what drives industry interest. This study fills that gap by quantifying the number of industry-funded papers at 10 top AI conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, ACL) and their citation influence. We analyze about 49.8K papers, about 1.8M citations from AI papers to other papers, and about 2.3M citations from other papers to AI papers from 1998-2022 in Scopus. Through seven research questions, we examine the volume and evolution of industry funding in AI research, the citation impact of funded papers, the diversity and temporal range of their citations, and the subfields in which industry predominantly acts. Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020. Between 2018 and 2022, 12 percent of industry-funded papers achieved high citation rates as measured by the h5-index, compared to 4 percent of non-industry-funded papers and 2 percent of non-funded papers. Top AI conferences engage more with industry-funded research than non-funded research, as measured by our newly proposed metric, the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR). We show that industry-funded research is increasingly insular, citing predominantly other industry-funded papers while referencing fewer non-funded papers. These findings reveal new trends in AI research funding, including a shift towards more industry-funded papers and their growing citation impact, greater insularity of industry-funded work than non-funded work, and a preference of industry-funded research to cite recent work.

Motivation: 高功率激光系统的光学像差会降低 HHG 系统的光束质量和效率，需要优化像差校正。

Method: 采用空间光调制器，实现并比较贝叶斯优化和卷积神经网络（CNN）方法来预测波前校正的最佳泽尼克多项式系数。

Result: CNN 在测试数据上准确率达到 80.39%。

Conclusion: CNN 方法展示了 HHG 系统自动像差校正的潜力。

Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process that enables table-top generation of tunable, high-energy, coherent, ultrashort radiation pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to soft X-ray range. These pulses find applications in photoemission spectroscopy in condensed matter physics, pump-probe spectroscopy for high-energy-density plasmas, and attosecond science. However, optical aberrations in the high-power laser systems required for HHG degrade beam quality and reduce efficiency. We present a machine learning approach to optimize aberration correction using a spatial light modulator. We implemented and compared Bayesian optimization and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods to predict optimal Zernike polynomial coefficients for wavefront correction. Our CNN achieved promising results with 80.39% accuracy on test data, demonstrating the potential for automated aberration correction in HHG systems.

Motivation: 开发能从部分观测预测电磁场动态的模型，助力光子设计数字孪生。

Method: 引入FieldSeer I模型，在对称对数域训练确保数值稳定，在FDTD基准上评估。

Result: FieldSeer I在三种实际设置中比GRU和确定性基线模型后缀保真度更高，可实现前缀后几何修改无需重新同化。

Conclusion: 几何条件世界模型为光子设计交互式数字孪生提供实用途径。

Abstract: We introduce FieldSeer I, a geometry-aware world model that forecasts electromagnetic field dynamics from partial observations in 2-D TE waveguides. The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80->Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240->Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180->Q=100). Crucially, it enables edit-after-prefix geometry modifications without re-assimilation. Results demonstrate that geometry-conditioned world models provide a practical path toward interactive digital twins for photonic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在音乐推理效果有限，且缺乏支持音乐问答的资源，因此需要构建相关资源并评估检索增强生成在音乐问答中的应用。

Method: 引入MusWikiDB和ArtistMus，通过实验评估RAG在音乐问答中的效果。

Result: RAG显著提高事实准确性，开源模型表现提升，RAG微调进一步提高召回和推理能力，MusWikiDB比通用维基百科语料更准确、检索更快。

Conclusion: 发布MusWikiDB和ArtistMus，为音乐信息检索和特定领域问答研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed open-domain question answering, yet their effectiveness in music-related reasoning remains limited due to sparse music knowledge in pretraining data. While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music.

Conclusion: 用学术问答对微调BERT效果好，有潜力开发大学特定领域问答模型和自主教育知识系统。

Abstract: Prior work on scientific question answering has largely emphasized chatbot-style systems, with limited exploration of fine-tuning foundation models for domain-specific reasoning. In this study, we developed a chatbot for the University of Limerick's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering to provide course information to students. A custom dataset of 1,203 question-answer pairs in SQuAD format was constructed using the university book of modules, supplemented with manually and synthetically generated entries. We fine-tuned BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) using PyTorch and evaluated performance with Exact Match and F1 scores. Results show that even modest fine-tuning improves hypothesis framing and knowledge extraction, demonstrating the feasibility of adapting foundation models to educational domains. While domain-specific BERT variants such as BioBERT and SciBERT exist for biomedical and scientific literature, no foundation model has yet been tailored to university course materials. Our work addresses this gap by showing that fine-tuning BERT with academic QA pairs yields effective results, highlighting the potential to scale towards the first domain-specific QA model for universities and enabling autonomous educational knowledge systems.

Motivation: 解决CoT-ICL在预训练知识不足时对新任务无效的问题。

Method: 使用CoT-ICL Lab框架研究问题，提出元训练技术学习新抽象推理任务，提出CoT-Recipe方法调节元训练序列中CoT和非CoT示例的混合。

Result: CoT-Recipe可使Transformer在新任务上的准确率最高提升300%，应用于预训练大模型在符号推理任务上准确率最高提升130%。

Conclusion: 提出的元训练技术和CoT-Recipe方法有效，能提升模型在新任务上的推理性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting combined with few-shot in-context learning (ICL) has unlocked significant reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, ICL with CoT examples is ineffective on novel tasks when the pre-training knowledge is insufficient. We study this problem in a controlled setting using the CoT-ICL Lab framework, and propose meta-training techniques to learn novel abstract reasoning tasks in-context. Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context. We confirm the broader effectiveness of these techniques by applying them to pretrained LLMs (Qwen2.5 series) for symbolic reasoning tasks and observing gains of up to 130% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出在线提前退出机制LYNX，利用模型隐藏状态实现置信控制的停止决策，在多个任务上实现准确性与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型常“过度思考”，浪费计算资源且影响准确性，现有提前停止方法存在不足。

Method: 将退出决策与生成中的推理线索关联，在线索标记的隐藏状态上训练轻量级探测器，用分裂共形预测控制过早退出。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上，单个数学训练的探测器实现了良好的准确性 - 效率权衡，减少了标记数量。

Conclusion: LYNX相比现有方法在帕累托前沿表现有竞争力或更优，完全在线，无需代理模型，提供明确的用户可调置信保证。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought, but they often "overthink": continuing to reason long after they have enough information to answer correctly. This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., "hmm", "wait") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees.

Motivation: 语言模型评判器存在自我偏好偏差，影响评估的公正性，需研究减轻该偏差的策略。

Method: 在成对比较中对评估候选对象应用黑盒扰动，如简单的同义词替换，以混淆作者身份，降低自我识别能力。

Result: 简单的同义词替换等扰动可降低自我偏好，但当进一步消除评估候选对象之间的风格差异时，自我偏好会恢复。

Conclusion: 自我识别和自我偏好在多个语义层面都会发生，尽管初步结果有希望，但完全减轻偏差仍有挑战。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) judges are widely used to evaluate the quality of LM outputs. Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的价值对齐系统在AGI和ASI发展下可能不足，且基于人类反馈的对齐资源消耗大、难扩展，基于AI反馈的方法受限于传统对齐价值。

Method: 引入集体智能体（CA）作为统一开放的对齐价值，提出动态对齐框架，包括用大语言模型自动生成训练数据集和自奖励机制。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能成功使模型与CA对齐，同时保留通用NLP能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的更全面的对齐目标和可扩展的自改进对齐方法是有效的。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically aligned with human values using preference data or predefined principles such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. However, as AI systems progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), such value systems may become insufficient. In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns the model to CA while preserving general NLP capabilities.

Abstract: The local news landscape, a vital source of reliable information for 28 million Americans, faces a growing threat from Pink Slime Journalism, a low-quality, auto-generated articles that mimic legitimate local reporting. Detecting these deceptive articles requires a fine-grained analysis of their linguistic, stylistic, and lexical characteristics. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to uncover the distinguishing patterns of Pink Slime content and propose detection strategies based on these insights. Beyond traditional generation methods, we highlight a new adversarial vector: modifications through large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that even consumer-accessible LLMs can significantly undermine existing detection systems, reducing their performance by up to 40% in F1-score. To counter this threat, we introduce a robust learning framework specifically designed to resist LLM-based adversarial attacks and adapt to the evolving landscape of automated pink slime journalism, and showed and improvement by up to 27%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have recently demonstrated strong potential in medical Question Answering (QA). Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: 提出的框架可用于处理具有异质标签的噪声黄金数据集的评估。

Abstract: Retrieving case law is a time-consuming task predominantly carried out by querying databases. We provide a comparison of two models in three different settings for Czech Constitutional Court decisions: (i) a large general-purpose embedder (OpenAI), (ii) a domain-specific BERT-trained from scratch on ~30,000 decisions using sliding windows and attention pooling. We propose a noise-aware evaluation including IDF-weighted keyword overlap as graded relevance, binarization via two thresholds (0.20 balanced, 0.28 strict), significance via paired bootstrap, and an nDCG diagnosis supported with qualitative analysis. Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant. Diagnostics attribute low absolutes to label drift and strong ideals rather than lack of utility. Additionally, our framework is robust enough to be used for evaluation under a noisy gold dataset, which is typical when handling data with heterogeneous labels stemming from legacy judicial databases.

Abstract: We present a methodology for improving the accuracy of faithfulness evaluation in Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed methodology is based on the combination of elementary faithfulness metrics into a combined (fused) metric, for the purpose of improving the faithfulness of LLM outputs. The proposed strategy for metric fusion deploys a tree-based model to identify the importance of each metric, which is driven by the integration of human judgements evaluating the faithfulness of LLM responses. This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness. Improving the ability to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs, allows for greater confidence to be placed within models, allowing for their implementation in a greater diversity of scenarios. Additionally, we homogenise a collection of datasets across question answering and dialogue-based domains and implement human judgements and LLM responses within this dataset, allowing for the reproduction and trialling of faithfulness evaluation across domains.

Conclusion: CICLe是一种实用且可扩展的高效文本分类方法，结合传统分类器和大语言模型优势，提高数据和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong in-context learning abilities, yet their effectiveness in text classification depends heavily on prompt design and incurs substantial computational cost. Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance. These findings highlight CICLe as a practical and scalable approach for efficient text classification, combining the robustness of traditional classifiers with the adaptability of LLMs, and achieving substantial gains in data and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 直接应用大语言模型到临床领域存在保持事实准确性和避免幻觉等挑战，需要改进医疗问答系统。

Method: 构建基于RAG的医疗问答系统，使用LoRA微调LLaMA 2和Falcon两个开源大模型，检索相关医学文献为答案提供依据。

Result: 在基准数据集上，检索增强使答案准确性有可衡量的提升，微调的LLaMA 2在PubMedQA上准确率达71.8%，提供源参考保持透明度，基于检索证据的答案减少约60%无依据内容。

Conclusion: RAG增强的开源大语言模型在可靠生物医学问答方面有潜力，可用于实际临床信息学应用。

Abstract: Medical question-answering (QA) systems can benefit from advances in large language models (LLMs), but directly applying LLMs to the clinical domain poses challenges such as maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations. In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications.

TL;DR: 介绍涵盖多语言和方言的大规模基准M4 - RAG用于评估检索增强的视觉问答，发现检索增强对不同规模视觉语言模型效果不同，该基准为推进下一代RAG系统奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型受静态训练数据限制，多语言多模态的检索增强生成（RAG）未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含42种语言、56种区域方言和语域，超80000个文化多样图像 - 问题对的M4 - RAG基准，搭建包含数百万精心策划多语言文档的受控检索环境。

Result: 检索增强对较小视觉语言模型有帮助，但无法扩展到较大模型，甚至常降低其性能。

Conclusion: M4 - RAG为推进跨语言、模态和文化背景无缝推理的下一代RAG系统提供基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance in visual question answering (VQA), yet they remain constrained by static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this limitation by enabling access to up-to-date, culturally grounded, and multilingual information; however, multilingual multimodal RAG remains largely underexplored. We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness. M4-RAG provides a foundation for advancing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning seamlessly across languages, modalities, and cultural contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自90年代以来就被考虑的问题：是否每个st - 平面图都存在平面直线支配绘制。

Method: 证明与向上平面直线绘制不同，具有规定y坐标的平面直线支配绘制不总是存在，且不能总是通过收缩 - 绘制 - 扩展归纳法构建；找出几类特定的st - 平面图。

Result: 证明平面直线支配绘制存在困难，找到几类总是存在平面直线支配绘制的st - 平面图。

Conclusion: 该问题有难度，但存在几类st - 平面图总是有平面直线支配绘制。

Abstract: We study the following question, which has been considered since the 90's: Does every $st$-planar graph admit a planar straight-line dominance drawing? We show concrete evidence for the difficulty of this question, by proving that, unlike upward planar straight-line drawings, planar straight-line dominance drawings with prescribed $y$-coordinates do not always exist and planar straight-line dominance drawings cannot always be constructed via a contract-draw-expand inductive approach. We also show several classes of $st$-planar graphs that always admit a planar straight-line dominance drawing. These include $st$-planar $3$-trees in which every stacking operation introduces two edges incoming into the new vertex, $st$-planar graphs in which every vertex is adjacent to the sink, $st$-planar graphs in which no face has the left boundary that is a single edge, and $st$-planar graphs that have a leveling with span at most two.

TL;DR: 本文介绍SSDLabeler框架生成半合成数据训练多标签伪迹分类器，相比之前方法提高了对原始EEG分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG记录存在伪迹，伪迹分类受训练数据限制，现有半合成数据方法存在生成数据不真实和适用性低的问题。

Method: 引入SSDLabeler框架，通过ICA分解真实EEG、使用RMS和PSD标准进行epoch级伪迹验证、将多种伪迹类型重新注入干净数据来生成带注释的半合成数据。

Result: 应用该框架训练多标签伪迹分类器，在不同条件下对原始EEG的分类准确率相比之前半合成数据和原始EEG训练有所提高。

Conclusion: SSDLabeler框架为处理EEG伪迹建立了可扩展基础，能捕捉真实EEG的共现性和复杂性。

Abstract: EEG recordings are inherently contaminated by artifacts such as ocular, muscular, and environmental noise, which obscure neural activity and complicate preprocessing. Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.

Result: 不仅能为新歌解码音乐注意力，还能跨新受试者解码，相比现有方法性能提升，消费级设备可可靠捕捉信号。

Conclusion: 在现实场景中用神经解码音乐可行，为教育、个性化音乐技术和治疗干预等应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.

Motivation: 分析基于社交媒体的美国工作满意度指标与县级劳动力市场状况的关系。

Method: 应用微调大语言模型处理26亿条地理定位推文构建工作满意度指标，进行逻辑回归分析。

Result: 农村县工作满意度低于城市县，劳动力市场紧张时差距减小，低失业率时工作质量感知趋同。

Conclusion: 劳动力市场松弛而非仅收入因素导致主观工作相关幸福感的空间不平等。

Abstract: We analyze a novel large-scale social-media-based measure of U.S. job satisfaction, constructed by applying a fine-tuned large language model to 2.6 billion georeferenced tweets, and link it to county-level labor market conditions (2013-2023). Logistic regressions show that rural counties consistently report lower job satisfaction sentiment than urban ones, but this gap decreases under tight labor markets. In contrast to widening rural-urban income disparities, perceived job quality converges when unemployment is low, suggesting that labor market slack, not income alone, drives spatial inequality in subjective work-related well-being.

Motivation: 探究贸易与金融开放度和土耳其银行运营效率及增长的关系。

Method: 运用CAMELG - DEA和动态面板数据分析。

Result: 贸易开放提升银行效率，金融开放促进银行增长，贫困对银行绩效有负面影响。

Conclusion: 贸易和金融开放对发展中经济体银行业增长至关重要。

Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between trade and financial openness, as well as the operational efficiency and growth of Turkish banks, from 2010 to 2023. Utilizing CAMELG-DEA and dynamic panel data analysis, the study finds that increased trade openness significantly enhances banking efficiency, primarily due to heightened demand for banking services related to international trade. Financial openness further boosts growth by facilitating capital flows, expanding banks' credit portfolios, and increasing fee income from cross-border transactions. However, poverty levels have a negative impact on bank performance, reducing financial intermediation and innovation opportunities. The results underscore the crucial role of trade and financial openness in fostering banking sector growth in developing economies.

Result: 制度拥挤指数显示与无序相关关键词激增，美国移民法庭有大量积压案件。

Conclusion: 全球化危机本质上是制度能力不均衡和政治瘫痪的危机。

Abstract: The divergence in globalization strategies between the US (retrenchment and polarization) and China (expansion) presents a puzzle that traditional distributional theories fail to fully explain. This paper offers a novel framework by conceptualizing the globalized economy as a "Congestible Club Good," leading to a "Fractured Metropolis." We argue that globalization flows ($M$) are constrained by domestic Institutional Capacity ($K$), which is heterogeneous and historically contingent. We introduce the concept of the "Optimization Cutoff": globalization incentivized the US to bypass costly domestic upgrades in favor of global expansion, leading to the long-term neglect of Public Capacity ($K_{Public}$). This historical path created a deep polarization. "Congested Incumbents," reliant on the stagnant $K_{Public}$, experience globalization as chaos ($MC>MB$), while "Insulated Elites" use Private Capacity ($K_{Private}$) to bypass bottlenecks ($MB>MC$). This divergence paralyzes the consensus needed to restore $K_{Public}$, creating a "Capacity Trap" where protectionism becomes the politically rational, yet economically suboptimal, equilibrium. Empirically, we construct an Institutional Congestion Index using textual analysis (2000-2024), revealing an exponential surge in disorder-related keywords (from 272 hits to 1,333). We triangulate this perception with the material failure of $K_{Public}$, such as the 3.7 million case backlog in US immigration courts. Our findings suggest the crisis of globalization is fundamentally a crisis of uneven institutional capacity and the resulting political paralysis.

Method: 构建两期模型，考虑当前生产对未来耐药性的影响。

Result: 伯特兰竞争导致赢家通吃结果，无论细菌交叉耐药性如何，战略威慑都是最优的。

Conclusion: 与古诺竞争相比，预期的价格竞争使在位者更有战略动力进行资源保护。

Abstract: We analyze how an incumbent antibiotic monopolist responds to the threat of post-entry Bertrand competition by a vertically differentiated rival. In a two-period model where current production drives future resistance, Bertrand competition leads to a winner-take-all outcome. We find that strategic deterrence is optimal regardless of bacterial cross-resistance to prospective rival drugs. In contrast with post-entry Cournot competition, anticipated price competition provides the incumbent with a stronger strategic incentive for conservation.

Motivation: 自然灾害严重威胁粮食安全，在土耳其等因地质和地理结构常受自然灾害影响的国家，这种影响更明显，因此研究其对土耳其粮食安全的影响。

Method: 先创建粮食安全指数，再进行三步计量分析，包括用单位根检验检查序列平稳性、用自回归分布滞后（ARDL）边界检验考察长期关系、估计自然灾害对粮食安全的影响。

Result: 地震、风暴和洪水对粮食安全有显著短期和长期负面影响，自然灾害对粮食安全的总体影响为负。

Conclusion: 自然灾害对土耳其粮食安全有显著负面作用。

Abstract: Food security refers to people's access to enough safe nutritious food in order to be able to lead a healthy active life. It also involves elements such as food availability and affordability, as well as people being able to access food that can be consumed healthily. Natural disasters, however, can seriously threaten food security. Disasters' effects on food security are especially more evident in countries such as Turkiye that are frequently exposed to natural disasters due to their geologic and geographical structure. For this reason, the study investigates the effects of natural disasters on food security in Turkiye. The research first creates the Food Security Index in order to estimate the effects of natural disasters on food security. The next phase follows the process of econometric analysis, which consists of three steps. Step one of the econometric analysis uses unit root tests to check the stationarity levels of the series. The second step uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test to examine the long-term relationship between natural disasters and food security. The third and final step estimates the effects of natural disasters on food security. According to the obtained results, the study shows earthquakes, storms, and floods to have a significant short- as well as long-term negative effect on food security. The overall impact of natural disasters on food security has also been determined to be negative.

Result: 最优碳税接近庇古水平，可行时高收入家庭碳税更高，考虑偏好异质性时最优税收表更趋近庇古基准。

Conclusion: 外部性活动税收调整受消费者偏好和收入影响，美国碳税接近庇古水平。

Abstract: How should taxes on externality-generating activities be adjusted if they are regressive? In our model, the government raises revenue using distortionary income and commodity taxes. If more or less productive people have identical tastes for externality-generating consumption, the government optimally imposes a Pigouvian tax equal to the marginal damage from the externality. This is true regardless of whether the tax is regressive. But, if regressivity reflects different preferences of people with different incomes rather than solely income effects, the optimal tax differs from the Pigouvian benchmark. We derive sufficient statistics for optimal policy, and use them to study carbon taxation in the United States. Our empirical results suggest an optimal carbon tax that is remarkably close to the Pigouvian level, but with higher carbon taxes for very high-income households if this is feasible. When we allow for heterogeneity in preferences at each income level as well as across the income distribution, our optimal tax schedules are further attenuated toward the Pigouvian benchmark.

Abstract: The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to lead to fundamental shifts in the labour market, resulting in displacement or augmentation of AI-exposed roles. To investigate the impact of AI across a large organisation, we assessed AI exposure at the task level within roles at the UK Civil Service (UKCS). Using a novel dataset of UKCS job adverts, covering 193,497 vacancies over 6 years, our large language model (LLM)-driven analysis estimated AI exposure scores of 1,542,411 tasks. By aggregating AI exposure scores for tasks within each role, we calculated the mean and variance of job-level exposure to AI, highlighting the heterogeneous impacts of AI, even for seemingly identical jobs. We then use an LLM to redesign jobs, focusing on task automation, task optimisation, and task reallocation. We find that the redesign process leads to tasks where humans have comparative advantage over AI, including strategic leadership, complex problem resolution, and stakeholder management. Overall, automation and augmentation are expected to have nuanced effects across all levels of the organisational hierarchy. Most economic value of AI is expected to arise from productivity gains rather than role displacement. We contribute to the automation, augmentation and productivity debates as well as advance our understanding of job redesign in the age of AI.

Method: 提出分层强化学习方法HRL - VNEAP，高层策略选拓扑或拒绝请求，低层策略将所选拓扑嵌入底层网络。

Result: 实验显示HRL - VNEAP性能最优，与基线相比，接受率最高提升20.7%，总收入最高提升36.2%，成本收益比最高提升22.1%。

Conclusion: HRL - VNEAP性能良好，与MILP对比量化了与最优解差距，为未来基于学习和优化的VNEAP解决方案研究提供动力。

Abstract: Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a key enabler of network slicing, yet most formulations assume that each Virtual Network Request (VNR) has a fixed topology. Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \textbf{20.7\%}, total revenue by up to \textbf{36.2\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \textbf{22.1\%}. Finally, we benchmark against an MILP formulation on tractable instances to quantify the remaining gap to optimality and motivate future work on learning- and optimization-based VNEAP solutions.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian non-parametric framework based on multi-task Gaussian processes, appropriate for temporal shrinkage. We focus on a particular class of dynamic hierarchical models to obtain evidence-based knowledge of infectious disease burden. These models induce a parsimonious way to capture cross-dependence between groups while retaining a natural interpretation based on an underlying mean process, itself expressed as a Gaussian process. We analyse distinct types of outbreak data from recent epidemics and find that the proposed models result in improved predictive ability against competing alternatives.

Conclusion: eSMC²为不完美监测数据的顺序贝叶斯推断提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Estimating latent epidemic states and model parameters from partially observed, noisy data remains a major challenge in infectious disease modeling. State-space formulations provide a coherent probabilistic framework for such inference, yet fully Bayesian estimation is often computationally prohibitive because evaluating the observed-data likelihood requires integration over all latent trajectories. The Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$) algorithm offers a principled approach for joint state and parameter inference, combining an outer SMC sampler over parameters with an inner particle filter that estimates the likelihood up to the current time point. Despite its theoretical appeal, this nested particle filter imposes substantial computational cost, limiting routine use in near-real-time outbreak response. We propose Ensemble SMC$^2$ (eSMC$^2$), a scalable variant that replaces the inner particle filter with an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to approximate the incremental likelihood at each observation time. While this substitution introduces bias via a Gaussian approximation, we mitigate finite-sample effects using an unbiased Gaussian density estimator and adapt the EnKF for epidemic data through state-dependent observation variance. This makes our approach particularly suitable for overdispersed incidence data commonly encountered in infectious disease surveillance. Simulation experiments with known ground truth and an application to 2022 United States (U.S.) monkeypox incidence data demonstrate that eSMC$^2$ achieves substantial computational gains while producing posterior estimates comparable to SMC$^2$. The method accurately recovers latent epidemic trajectories and key epidemiological parameters, providing an efficient framework for sequential Bayesian inference from imperfect surveillance data.

Abstract: This paper focusses on robust estimation of location and concentration parameters of the von Mises-Fisher distribution in the Bayesian framework. The von Mises-Fisher (or Langevin) distribution has played a central role in directional statistics. Directional data have been investigated for many decades, and more recently, they have gained increasing attention in diverse areas such as bioinformatics and text data analysis. Although outliers can significantly affect the estimation results even for directional data, the treatment of outliers remains an unresolved and challenging problem. In the frequentist framework, numerous studies have developed robust estimation methods for directional data with outliers, but, in contrast, only a few robust estimation methods have been proposed in the Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference based on density power-divergence and $γ$-divergence and establish their asymptotic properties and robustness. In addition, the Bayesian approach naturally provides a way to assess estimation uncertainty through the posterior distribution, which is particularly useful for small samples. Furthermore, to carry out the posterior computation, we develop the posterior computation algorithm based on the weighted Bayesian bootstrap for estimating parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation studies. Using two real datasets, we further show that the proposed method provides reliable and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers or data contamination.

Abstract: Optimal experimental design is a classic topic in statistics, with many well-studied problems, applications, and solutions. The design problem we study is the placement of sensors to monitor spatiotemporal processes, explicitly accounting for the temporal dimension in our modeling and optimization. We observe that recent advancements in computational sciences often yield large datasets based on physics-based simulations, which are rarely leveraged in experimental design. We introduce a novel model-based sensor placement criterion, along with a highly-efficient optimization algorithm, which integrates physics-based simulations and Bayesian experimental design principles to identify sensor networks that "minimize information loss" from simulated data. Our technique relies on sparse variational inference and (separable) Gauss-Markov priors, and thus may adapt many techniques from Bayesian experimental design. We validate our method through a case study monitoring air temperature in Phoenix, Arizona, using state-of-the-art physics-based simulations. Our results show our framework to be superior to random or quasi-random sampling, particularly with a limited number of sensors. We conclude by discussing practical considerations and implications of our framework, including more complex modeling tools and real-world deployments.

Conclusion: 所提决策模型保留原理论的吸引力和简单性，能克服明确指定世界状态的问题，通过应用示例得到了验证。

Abstract: Analyzing decision problems under uncertainty commonly relies on idealizing assumptions about the describability of the world, with the most prominent examples being the closed world and the small world assumption. Most assumptions are operationalized by introducing states of the world, conditional on which the decision situation can be analyzed without any remaining uncertainty. Conversely, most classical decision-theoretic approaches are not applicable if the states of the world are inaccessible. We propose a decision model that retains the appeal and simplicity of the original theory, but completely overcomes the need to specify the states of the world explicitly. The main idea of our approach is to address decision problems in a radically empirical way: instead of specifying states and consequences prior to the decision analysis, we only assume a protocol of observed act--consequence pairs as model primitives. We show how optimality in such empirical decision problems can be addressed by using protocol-based empirical choice functions and discuss three approaches for deriving inferential guarantees: (I) consistent statistical estimation of choice sets, (II) consistent statistical testing of choice functions with robustness guarantees, and (III) direct inference for empirical choice functions using credal sets. We illustrate our theory with a proof-of-concept application comparing different prompting strategies in generative AI models.

Conclusion: 重入网络是一类独特的自指神经动力学，支持递归且有界的计算。

Abstract: We formulate the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Network (FHRN) as a continuous-time neural-ODE system, revealing its role as a norm-regulated reentrant dynamical process. Starting from the discrete reentry rule $x_t = x_t^{(\mathrm{ex})} + γ\, W_r\, g(\|y_{t-1}\|)\, y_{t-1}$, we derive the coupled system $\dot{y}=-y+f(W_ry;\,x,\,A)+g_{\mathrm{h}}(y)$ showing that the network couples fast associative memory with global radial homeostasis. The dynamics admit bounded attractors governed by an energy functional, yielding a ring-like manifold. A Jacobian spectral analysis identifies a \emph{reflective regime} in which reentry induces stable oscillatory trajectories rather than divergence or collapse. Unlike continuous-time recurrent neural networks or liquid neural networks, FHRN achieves stability through population-level gain modulation rather than fixed recurrence or neuron-local time adaptation. These results establish the reentry network as a distinct class of self-referential neural dynamics supporting recursive yet bounded computation.
