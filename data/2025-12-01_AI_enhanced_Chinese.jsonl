Their exact computation, however, is intractable because it requires aggregating marginal contributions over exponentially many permutations or subsets. While sampling-based estimators have been studied in cooperative game theory, their direct use for relational query answering remains underexplored and often ignores the structure of schemas and joins.\n  We study tuple-level attribution for relational queries through sampling and introduce Relation-Stratified Sampling (RSS). Instead of stratifying coalitions only by size, RSS partitions the sample space by a relation-wise count vector that records how many tuples are drawn from each relation. This join-aware stratification concentrates samples on structurally valid and informative coalitions and avoids strata that cannot satisfy query conditions. We further develop an adaptive variant, ARSS, that reallocates budget across strata using variance estimates obtained during sampling, improving estimator efficiency without increasing the total number of samples. We analyze these estimators, describe a practical implementation that reuses compiled views to reduce per-sample query cost, and evaluate them on TPCH workloads.\n  Across diverse queries with multi-relation joins and aggregates, RSS and ARSS consistently outperform classical Monte Carlo (MCS) and size-based Stratified Sampling (SS), yielding lower error and variance with fewer samples. An ablation shows that relation-aware stratification and adaptive allocation contribute complementary gains, making ARSS a simple, effective, and anytime estimator for database-centric Shapley attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRelation - Stratified Sampling (RSS)\u53ca\u5176\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53ARSS\u7528\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5143\u7ec4\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5728TPCH\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Shapley\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u67e5\u8be2\u56de\u7b54\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRSS\uff0c\u6309\u5173\u7cfb\u8ba1\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u5212\u5206\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53ARSS\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u91cd\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u89c6\u56fe\u964d\u4f4e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u5173\u7cfb\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\uff0cRSS\u548cARSS\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cARSS\u662f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u5fc3Shapley\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u968f\u65f6\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002"}}

Recent studies indicate that distributed databases exhibit significantly higher latency than single-node databases, primarily due to consensus protocols maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes. We argue that synchronization cost constitutes the primary bottleneck for distributed databases, which is particularly pronounced in wide-area networks (WAN). Fortunately, we identify opportunities to optimize synchronization costs in real production environments: (1) network clustering phenomena, (2) triangle inequality violations in transmission, and (3) redundant data transfers. Based on these observations, we propose GeoCoCo, a synchronization acceleration framework for cross-region distributed databases. First, GeoCoCo presents a group rescheduling strategy that adapts to real-time network conditions to maximize WAN transmission efficiency. Second, GeoCoCo introduces a task-preserving data filtering method that reduces data volume transmitted over the WAN. Finally, GeoCoCo develops a consistency-guaranteed transmission framework integrating grouping and pruning. Extensive evaluations in both trace-driven simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GeoCoCo reduces synchronization cost-primarily by lowering WAN bandwidth usage-by up to 40.3%, and increases system throughput by up to 14.1% in GeoGauss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\u662f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGeoCoCo\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5e7f\u57df\u7f51\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoCoCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7ec4\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7f\u57df\u7f51\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u526a\u679d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cGeoCoCo\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e40.3%\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7f\u57df\u7f51\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5728GeoGauss\u4e2d\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad814.1%\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoCoCo\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions.

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), recent studies have explored zero-shot and few-shot prompting to improve entity matching accuracy. However, most existing approaches rely on single-step prompting and offer limited investigation into structured reasoning strategies. In this work, we investigate how to enhance LLM-based entity matching by decomposing the matching process into multiple explicit reasoning stages. We propose a three-step framework that first identifies matched and unmatched tokens between two records, then determines the attributes most influential to the matching decision, and finally predicts whether the records refer to the same real-world entity.

The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing.

These strengths present new opportunities to enhance traditional recommendation systems (RS), especially in the cold-start item scenario where newly introduced items lack interactions. Existing works have used LLMs to address cold-start issues in traditional RS through data augmentation, but they have limitations. One recent work directly addresses this issue by prompting LLMs to generate augmented interaction data between randomly sampled users and cold-start items. Then, they train the traditional RS with augmented data, incorporating collaborative signals for cold-start items. Although they use LLMs to provide cold-start items with feedback, they use partial user histories, which does not allow the LLM to fully emulate the user. Furthermore, randomly selecting users is not optimal for augmentation. To address these challenges, we leverage the LLM as a user and develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains a policy to select users for augmentation, optimizing for cold-start item performance after augmented training. The policy model learns to select users for cold-start item data augmentation based on their behavioral features and histories. To optimize user selection for cold-start item performance, we employ a policy gradient method that updates the policy in the direction of actions that lead to high rewards. Experiments on Amazon Product Review datasets show substantial gains in cold-start item recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method as a scalable, serving-efficient augmentation strategy for modern RS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528LLM\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The textual semantics of data products are vital for pricing and contain significant value that remains largely underexplored. Therefore, to investigate how textual features influence data product pricing, we employ five prevalent text representation techniques to encode the descriptive text of data products. And then, we employ six machine learning methods to predict data product prices, including linear regression, neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and XGBoost. Our empirical design consists of two tasks: a regression task that predicts the continuous price of data products, and a classification task that discretizes price into ordered categories. Furthermore, we conduct feature importance analysis by the mRMR feature selection method and SHAP-based interpretability techniques. Based on empirical data from the AWA Data Exchange, we find that for predicting continuous prices, Word2Vec text representations capturing semantic similarity yield superior performance. In contrast, for price-tier classification tasks, simpler representations that do not rely on semantic similarity, such as Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, perform better. SHAP analysis reveals that semantic features related to healthcare and demographics tend to increase prices, whereas those associated with weather and environmental topics are linked to lower prices. This analytical framework significantly enhances the interpretability of pricing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u80fd\u8ba9\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e02\u573a\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5728\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u4ef7\u503c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u54c1\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528mRMR\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548cSHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8fde\u7eed\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684Word2Vec\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u4ef7\u683c\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684Bag - of - Words\u548cTF - IDF\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff1bSHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u533b\u7597\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f7f\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u4f7f\u4ef7\u683c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We present a minimal repeated auction model that yields a simple incentive compatibility condition and a closed form threshold for sustainable collusion for subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. In controlled simulations with multiple language models, we observe systematic supra-competitive prices in small auction settings and a return to competitive behavior as the number of bidders in the market increases, consistent with the theoretical model. We also find LLMs use various mechanisms to facilitate tacit coordination, such as focal point acceptance timing versus patient strategies that track the theoretical incentives. The results provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of bidder side tacit collusion by LLMs and show that market structure levers can be more effective than capability limits for mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u8377\u5170\u5f0f\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u65e0\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e0b\u9ed8\u5951\u5408\u8c0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u62cd\u5356\u573a\u666f\u6709\u8d85\u7ade\u4e89\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u589e\u591a\u56de\u5f52\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7ade\u6807\u65b9\u9ed8\u5951\u5408\u8c0b\u9996\u4efd\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u8377\u5170\u5f0f\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u65e0\u4ea4\u6d41\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ed8\u5951\u5408\u8c0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u91cd\u590d\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u51fa\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5408\u8c0b\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u62cd\u5356\u573a\u666f\u51fa\u73b0\u8d85\u7ade\u4e89\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u6807\u8005\u589e\u591a\u56de\u5f52\u7ade\u4e89\uff0cLLM\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ed8\u5951\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86LLM\u7ade\u6807\u65b9\u9ed8\u5951\u5408\u8c0b\u7684\u9996\u4efd\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u624b\u6bb5\u6bd4\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5408\u8c0b\u3002"}}

These bounds are called extended convolution bounds, which not only complement the results in the literature (convolution bounds in Blanchet et al.

Next, applying the above inequality, we study the risk sharing for the averaged quantiles (corresponding to risk sharing for distortion risk measures with special inverse S-shaped distortion functions), which is a non-convex optimization problem. We obtain the expression of the minimal value of the risk sharing and the explicit expression for the corresponding optimal allocation, which is comonotonic risk sharing for large losses and counter-comonotonic risk sharing for small losses or large gains.

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9694\u79bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4e92\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\uff08ASI\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u58f0\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8bb2\u771f\u8bdd\u8054\u76df\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u867d\u8017\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316ASI\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4ea4\u63a5\u53e3\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u58f0\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u2018\u4e00\u81f4\u7fa4\u4f53\u2019\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u9700\u9ad8\u58f0\u8a89\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u4fc3\u4f7f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8bb2\u771f\u8bdd\u8054\u76df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Unlike prevailing l1 regularized approaches that approximate a sparsifying penalty, we formulate the problem by imposing an explicit cardinality constraint on the kernel weights and add an l2 penalty for robustness. We solve the resulting non-convex minimax problem via an alternating best response algorithm with two subproblems: the alpha subproblem is a standard kernel SVM dual solved via LIBSVM, while the beta subproblem admits an efficient solution via the Greedy Selector and Simplex Projector algorithm. We reformulate SMKL as a mixed integer semidefinite optimization problem and derive a hierarchy of semidefinite convex relaxations which can be used to certify near-optimality of the solutions returned by our best response algorithm and also to warm start it. On ten UCI benchmarks, our method with random initialization outperforms state-of-the-art MKL approaches in out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 3.34 percentage points (relative to the best performing benchmark) while selecting a small number of candidate kernels in comparable runtime.

However, edge devices typically operate under strict constraints on processing power, memory, and energy consumption, making them unsuitable for large language models (LLMs). Fortunately, Small Language Models (SLMs) offer lightweight alternatives that bring AI inference to resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing computational cost while remaining suitable for specialization and customization. In this scenario, selecting the hardware platform that best balances performance and efficiency for SLM inference is challenging due to strict resource limitations. To address this issue, this study evaluates the inference performance and energy efficiency of commercial CPUs (Intel and ARM), GPUs (NVIDIA), and NPUs (RaiderChip) for running SLMs. GPUs, the usual platform of choice, are compared against commercial NPUs and recent multi-core CPUs. While NPUs leverage custom hardware designs optimized for computation, modern CPUs increasingly incorporate dedicated features targeting language-model workloads. Using a common execution framework and a suite of state-of-the-art SLMs, we analyze both maximum achievable performance and processing and energy efficiency across commercial solutions available for each platform. The results indicate that specialized backends outperform general-purpose CPUs, with NPUs achieving the highest performance by a wide margin. Bandwidth normalization proves essential for fair cross-architecture comparisons. Although low-power ARM processors deliver competitive results when energy usage is considered, metrics that combine performance and power (such as EDP) again highlight NPUs as the dominant architecture.

Driven by strict privacy requirements, inference must run at the edge of the vision sensor, demanding robust, real-time, and always-on perception under tight hardware constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a neuromorphic fall detection system that integrates the Sony IMX636 event-based vision sensor with the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic processor via a dedicated FPGA-based interface, leveraging the sparsity of event data together with near-memory asynchronous processing. Using a newly recorded dataset under diverse environmental conditions, we explore the design space of sparse neural networks deployable on a single Loihi 2 chip and analyze the tradeoffs between detection F1 score and computational cost. Notably, on the Pareto front, our LIF-based convolutional SNN with graded spikes achieves the highest computational efficiency, reaching a 55x synaptic operations sparsity for an F1 score of 58%.

Building upon the Georgist distinction between produced value and unearned rent, the model departs from the static equilibrium tradition by introducing an explicit diffusion process for land values and a local investment dynamic governed by profitability thresholds. Land value $V (x, y, t)$ and built capital $K(x, y, t)$evolve over a two-dimensional urban domain according to coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, incorporating local productivity $A(x, y)$, centrality effects $\u03bc(x, y)$, depreciation $\u03b4$, and fiscal pressure $\u03c4$ . Analytical characterization of the steady states reveals a transcritical bifurcation in the parameter $\u03c4$ , separating inactive (low-investment) and active (self-sustaining) spatial regimes. The equilibrium pair $(V ^*, K^*)$ is shown to exist only when the effective decay rate $\u03b1= r + \u03c4- \u03bc(x, y)$ exceeds a profitability threshold $\u03b8= \u03ba+ \u03b4/ I_0$, and becomes locally unstable beyond this boundary. The introduction of diffusion, $D_V \u0394V$, stabilizes spatial dynamics and generates continuous gradients of land value and capital intensity, mitigating speculative clustering while preserving productive incentives. Numerical simulations confirm these analytical properties and display the emergence of spatially heterogeneous steady states driven by urban centrality and local productivity. The model also quantifies key aggregate outcomes, including dynamic tax revenues, adjusted capital-to-land ratios, and net present values under spatial heterogeneity and temporal discounting. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the main qualitative mechanisms-critical activation, spatial recomposition, and bifurcation structure-remain robust under alternative spatial profiles $(A, \u03bc)$, discretization schemes, and moderate differentiation of the tax rate $\u03c4(x, y)$. From an economic perspective, the results clarify the dual nature of the LVT: while it erodes unproductive rents and speculative land holding, its dynamic incidence on built capital depends on local profitability and financing constraints. The taxation parameter $\u03c4$ thus acts as a control variable in a nonlinear spatial system, shaping transitions between rent-driven and production-driven equilibria. Within a critical range around $\u03c4_c$, the LVT functions as an efficient spatial reallocation operator-reducing inequality in land values and investment density without impairing aggregate productivity. Beyond this range, excessive taxation induces systemic contraction and investment stagnation. Overall, this research bridges static urban tax theory with dynamic spatial economics by formalizing how a land-based fiscal instrument can reshape the geography of value creation through endogenous diffusion and nonlinear feedback. The framework provides a foundation for future extensions involving stochastic shocks, adaptive policy feedbacks, or endogenous public investment, offering a unified quantitative perspective on the dynamic efficiency and spatial equity of land value taxation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u571f\u5730\u4ef7\u503c\u7a0e\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u571f\u5730\u5e02\u573a\u7b49\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7a33\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u571f\u5730\u4ef7\u503c\u7a0e\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u4f5c\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u57fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u571f\u5730\u4ef7\u503c\u7a0e\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u571f\u5730\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u518d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u9759\u6001\u5747\u8861\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u571f\u5730\u4ef7\u503c\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6295\u8d44\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u571f\u5730\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5efa\u6210\u8d44\u672c\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u03c4\u7684\u8de8\u4e34\u754c\u5206\u5c94\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5747\u8861\u5bf9\u5b58\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u7a33\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5173\u952e\u603b\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u571f\u5730\u4ef7\u503c\u7a0e\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7a7a\u95f4\u518d\u5206\u914d\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u8303\u56f4\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Serial Safety Net (SSN) offers a lightweight commit-time test but is conservative and effectively anchored on commit time as the sole point. We present ESSN, a principled generalization of SSN that relaxes the exclusion condition to allow more transactions to commit safely, and we prove that this preserves multiversion serializability (MVSR) and that it strictly subsumes SSN. ESSN states an MVSG (Multiversion Serialization Graph)-based criterion and introduces a known total order over transactions (KTO; e.g., begin-ordered or commit-ordered) for reasoning about the graph's serializability. With a single commit-time check under invariant-based semantics, ESSN's exclusion condition preserves monotonicity along per-item version chains, and eliminates chain traversal. The protocol is Direct Serialization Graph (DSG)-based with commit-time work linear in the number of reads and writes, matching SSN's per-version footprint. We also make mixed workloads explicit by defining a Long transaction via strict interval containment of Short transactions, and we evaluate ESSN on reproducible workloads.

Our results demonstrate that higher-dimensional embeddings significantly boost search quality (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding-8B/4096 achieves Top-3 accuracy about 0.571 versus 0.412 for GTE-large/1024), and that neural re-rankers (e.g., a BGE cross-encoder) further improve ranking accuracy (Top-3 up to 0.527). Finer-grained chunking (512 characters versus 2000 characters) also improves accuracy. We discuss the impact of these factors and outline future directions for pipeline automation and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ba1\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5757\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ba1\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u5728AI\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u542b11,975\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2 - \u5757\u5bf9\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u6307\u6807\u6d4b\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5757\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ba1\u9053\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

For three months of open AIS data in the Baltic Sea from August to October 2024, we present (i) cleansing and reconstruction methods to improve the data quality, and (ii) a journey model that converts AIS message data into vessel counts, traffic estimates, and spatially resolved vessel density at a resolution of $\\sim$400 m. Vessel counts are provided, along with their uncertainties, for both moving and stationary activity. Vessel density maps also enable the identification of port locations, and we infer the most crowded and busiest coastal areas in the Baltic Sea.

However, despite its popularity, DP imposes strict requirements which guard against strong worst-case scenarios. For example, it guards against seemingly unrealistic scenarios where an attacker has full information about all but one point in the data set, and still nothing can be learned about the remaining point. While preventing such a strong attack is desirable, many works have explored whether average-case relaxations of DP are easier to satisfy [HWR13,WLF16,BF16,LWX23].\n  In this work, we are motivated by the question of whether alternate, weaker notions of privacy are possible: can a weakened privacy notion still guarantee some basic level of privacy, and on the other hand, achieve privacy more efficiently and/or for a substantially broader set of tasks? Our main result shows the answer is no: even in the statistical setting, any reasonable measure of privacy satisfying nontrivial composition is equivalent to DP. To prove this, we identify a core set of four axioms or desiderata: pre-processing invariance, prohibition of blatant non-privacy, strong composition, and linear scalability. Our main theorem shows that any privacy measure satisfying our axioms is equivalent to DP, up to polynomial factors in sample complexity. We complement this result by showing our axioms are minimal: removing any one of our axioms enables ill-behaved measures of privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u5f31\u9690\u79c1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5408\u7406\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u57fa\u672c\u9690\u79c1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u6216\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u786e\u5b9a\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u516c\u7406\uff1a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u7981\u6b62\u660e\u663e\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u5f3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u6ee1\u8db3\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5408\u7406\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u90fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u516c\u7406\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u56e0\u5b50\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system.

Code refactoring plays a critical role in this transition by improving structural organization and optimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods are limited in their ability to generalize across multiple programming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on manually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-engineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for multilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that Java achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the 10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of 94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high similarity (Approx. 53-54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance between structural modifications and semantic preservation.

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine data-driven learning with physics-based constraints to ensure the model's predictions are with underlying physical principles.However, PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for edge computing and real-time processing. However, naively converting PINNs to SNNs degrades physical fidelity and fails to address long-term generalization issues. To this end, this paper introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Importantly, to ensure strict physical conservation, we design the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, whose dynamics structurally guarantee local mass preservation. To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction. Extensive experiments show that our PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks. For both the canonical 1D heat equation and the more challenging 2D Laplace's Equation, it accurately simulates the system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design -- a feat that is challenging for conventional PINNs.

For QMC, we built new algorithms for vectorized error estimation and developed QMCPy (https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/): an open-source Python interface to randomized low-discrepancy sequence generators, automatic variable transforms, adaptive error estimation procedures, and diverse use cases. For GPs, we derived new digitally-shift-invariant kernels of higher-order smoothness, developed novel fast multitask GP algorithms, and produced the scalable Python software FastGPs (https://alegresor.github.io/fastgps/). For sciML, we developed a new algorithm capable of machine precision recovery of PDEs with random coefficients. We have also studied a number of applications including GPs for probability of failure estimation, multilevel GPs for the Darcy flow equation, neural surrogates for modeling radiative transfer, and fast GPs for Bayesian multilevel QMC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5728\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6613\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1QMCPy\uff1b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u63a8\u51faFastGPs\uff1b\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\u5e26\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u6570\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86QMCPy\u3001FastGPs\u7b49\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In the case of classification, precision and recall are scores with probabilistic interpretations that are both important to consider and complementary. The rankings induced by these two scores are often in partial contradiction. In practice, therefore, it is extremely useful to establish a compromise between the two views to obtain a single, global ranking. Over the last fifty years or so,it has been proposed to take a weighted harmonic mean, known as the F-score, F-measure, or $F_\u03b2$. Generally speaking, by averaging basic scores, we obtain a score that is intermediate in terms of values. However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_\u03b2$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_\u03b2$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard.

It can be modeled as a search problem in which the search space is the set of all valid programs. As the search space is vast, brute force is usually not feasible, and search heuristics, such as genetic programming, also have difficulty navigating it without guidance. This text presents 2 novel GP algorithms that synthesize pure, typed, and functional programs: HOTGP and Origami. HOTGP uses strong types and a functional grammar, synthesizing Haskell code, with support for higher-order functions, $\u03bb$-functions, and parametric polymorphism. Experimental results show that HOTGP is competitive with the state of the art. Additionally, Origami is an algorithm that tackles the challenge of effectively handling loops and recursion by exploring Recursion Schemes, in which the programs are composed of well-defined templates with only a few parts that need to be synthesized. The first implementation of Origami can synthesize solutions in several Recursion Schemes and data structures, being competitive with other GP methods in the literature, as well as LLMs. The latest version of Origami employs a novel procedure, called AC/DC, designed to improve the search-space exploration. It achieves considerable improvement over its previous version by raising success rates on every problem. Compared to similar methods in the literature, it has the highest count of problems solved with success rates of $100\\%$, $\\geq 75\\%$, and $\\geq 25\\%$ across all benchmarks. In $18\\%$ of all benchmark problems, it stands as the only method to reach $100\\%$ success rate, being the first known approach to achieve it on any problem in PSB2.

Existing metrics, ranging from facility measures (PUE) and rack power density to network metrics (all-reduce latency), data-pipeline measures, and financial metrics (TCO series), each capture only their own domain and provide no integrated view of how physical, computational, and economic constraints interact. This fragmentation obscures the structural relationships among energy, computation, and cost, preventing a coherent optimization across sector and how bottlenecks emerge, propagate, and jointly determine the efficiency frontier of AI infrastructure.\n  This paper develops an integrated framework that unifies these disparate metrics through a three-domain semantic classification and a six-layer architectural decomposition, producing a 6x3 taxonomy that maps how various sectors propagate across the AI infrastructure stack. The taxonomy is grounded in a systematic review and meta-analysis of all metrics with economic and financial relevance, identifying the most widely used measures, their research intensity, and their cross-domain interdependencies. Building on this evidence base, the Metric Propagation Graph (MPG) formalizes cross-layer dependencies, enabling systemwide interpretation, composite-metric construction, and multi-objective optimization of energy, carbon, and cost.\n  The framework offers a coherent foundation for benchmarking, cluster design, capacity planning, and lifecycle economic analysis by linking physical operations, computational efficiency, and cost outcomes within a unified analytic structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa6x3\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548cMPG\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u957f\u53d7\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u963b\u788dAI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u516d\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa6x3\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u548c\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMetric Propagation Graph (MPG)\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5c42\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u96c6\u7fa4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter.

This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement.

In the discrete setting, the problem is most often solved by alternate minimization, exploiting the separate convexity of the energy with respect to the two unknowns. This approach is theoretically guaranteed to converge, provided each of the individual subproblems is solved successfully. However, strong non-linearities of the energy functional may lead to failure of iterative convergence within one or both subproblems. In this paper, we propose an exact line search algorithm based on bisection, which (under certain conditions) guarantees global convergence of Newton's method for each subproblem and consequently the successful determination of critical points of the energy through the alternate minimization scheme.

These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.\n  We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.\n  We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls.

While existing research emphasizes the adherence of AI to honest ethical principles, it overlooks the potential benefits of benevolent deception, which maximize overall payoffs. This study proposes a game-theoretic model for lane-changing scenarios, incorporating Bayesian inference to capture dynamic changes in human trust during interactions under external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) disclosed information. Case studies reveal that benevolent deception can enhance the efficiency of interaction in up to 59.4% of scenarios and improve safety in up to 52.7%. However, in the most pronounced cases, deception also led to trust collapse in up to 36.9% of drivers, exposing a critical vulnerability in the ethical design of ADS. The findings suggest that aligning ADS with comprehensive human ethical values, including the conditional use of benevolent deception, can enhance human-machine interaction.

Second, attractiveness of cryptocurrencies also matters in terms of their price determination, but only in long-run. This indicates that formation (recognition) of the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies are subjected to time factor. In other words, it travels slowly within the market. Third, SP500 index seems to have weak positive long-run impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin, while its sign turns to negative losing significance in short-run, except Bitcoin that generates an estimate of -0.20 at 10% significance level. Lastly, error-correction models for Bitcoin, Etherem, Dash, Litcoin, and Monero show that cointegrated series cannot drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a speed of 23.68%, 12.76%, 10.20%, 22.91%, and 14.27% respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u75282010 - 2018\u5e74\u5468\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e94\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a762010 - 2018\u5e74\u4e94\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u5e03\u6ede\u540e\uff08ARDL\uff09\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "1. \u52a0\u5bc6\u5e02\u573a\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u90fd\u662f\u4e94\u79cd\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b2. \u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u53ea\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u683c\uff1b3. \u6807\u666e500\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u8d27\u5e01\u957f\u671f\u6709\u5f31\u6b63\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u53d8\u5316\uff1b4. \u8bef\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u5404\u8d27\u5e01\u6536\u655b\u5230\u957f\u671f\u5747\u8861\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u671f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5404\u8d27\u5e01\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u957f\u671f\u5747\u8861\u3002"}}

This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). The framework categorizes AI-specific risks into nine critical domains: Misuse, Poisoning, Privacy, Adversarial, Biases, Unreliable Outputs, Drift, Supply Chain, and IP Threat, integrating 53 operationally defined sub-threats. Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact. The taxonomy is empirically validated through an analysis of 133 documented AI incidents from 2025 (achieving 100% classification coverage) and reconciled against the main AI risk frameworks.

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination.

Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5e73\u8861\u4f20\u64ad\uff08EP\uff09\u6446\u8131\u65e0\u7a77\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8d6b\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e7f\u4e49 EP \u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba9\u5e73\u8861\u4f20\u64ad\u6446\u8131\u65e0\u7a77\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5409\u5e03\u65af - \u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5fae\u6270\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5dee\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u662f\u9884\u671f\u5c40\u90e8\u80fd\u91cf\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931 - \u80fd\u91cf\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e7f\u4e49 EP \u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8d6b\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u9650\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65e0\u7a77\u5c0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u51f8\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49 EP \u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u57fa\u7840\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u548c\u4e4c\u62c9\u572d\uff0c\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u5236\u5ea6\u5f52\u5c5e\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d1\u5c55\u53d7\u8de8\u56fd\u5236\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5236\u5ea6\u5f52\u5c5e\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u957f\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u548c\u4e4c\u62c9\u572d\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u548cWasserstein GAN\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u75281960 - 2020\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u9884\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08EDS\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u82e5\u5904\u4e8e\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u5236\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u53d1\u5c55\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u8870\u9000\uff1b\u82e5\u5904\u4e8e\u6b27\u6d32\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e4c\u62c9\u572d\u4f1a\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u5c55\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u7531\u56fd\u5185\u6539\u9769\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u8de8\u56fd\u5236\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system.

Researchers sometimes aim to estimate per-key quantiles (i.e. quantile estimation for every distinct key), and some popular use cases, such as tail latency measurement, recline on a predefined single quantile (e.g. 0.95- or 0.99- quantile) rather than demanding arbitrary quantile estimation. However, existing algorithms are not specially designed for per-key estimation centered at one point. They cannot achieve high accuracy in our problem setting, and their throughput are not satisfactory to handle high-speed items in data streams. To solve this problem, we propose MagnifierSketch for point-quantile estimation. MagnifierSketch supports both single-key and per-key quantile estimation, and its key techniques are named Value Focus, Distribution Calibration and Double Filtration. We provide strict mathematical derivations to prove the unbiasedness of MagnifierSketch and show its space and time complexity. Our experimental results show that the Average Error (AE) of MagnifierSketch is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art in both single-key and per-key situations.

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability.

This research presents a comprehensive financial framework for quantifying AI project returns that explicitly integrates changes in organizational risk profiles. The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001. Drawing on established risk quantification methods, including annual loss expectancy calculations and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this framework enables practitioners to compute net benefits that incorporate both productivity gains and the delta between pre-implementation and post-implementation risk exposures. The analysis demonstrates that accurate AI investment evaluation requires explicit modeling of control effectiveness, reserve requirements for algorithmic failures, and the ongoing operational costs of maintaining model performance.

Our experiments show indeed that multidimensional threshold tuning yields performance improvements across various networks and datasets. Moreover, we derive a multiclass ROC analysis based on \\emph{ROC clouds} -- the attainable (FPR,TPR) operating points induced by a single multiclass threshold -- and summarize them via a \\emph{Distance From Point} (DFP) score to $(0,1)$.

Mean-variance regression models, which predict both a mean and residual noise for each data point, provide a simple approach to uncertainty quantification. However, overparameterized mean-variance models struggle with signal-to-noise ambiguity, deciding whether prediction targets should be attributed to signal (mean) or noise (variance). At one extreme, models fit all training targets perfectly with zero residual noise, while at the other, they provide constant, uninformative predictions and explain the targets as noise. We observe a sharp phase transition between these extremes, driven by model regularization. Empirical studies with varying regularization levels illustrate this transition, revealing substantial variability across repeated runs. To explain this behavior, we develop a statistical field theory framework, which captures the observed phase transition in alignment with experimental results. This analysis reduces the regularization hyperparameter search space from two dimensions to one, significantly lowering computational costs.

This work investigates how the structure of the network influences the performance of RC in four systems of increasing complexity: the Mackey-Glass system with delayed-feedback, two low-dimensional thermal convection models, and a three-dimensional shear flow model exhibiting transition to turbulence. Using five reservoir topologies in which connectivity patterns and edge weights are controlled independently, we evaluate both direct- and cross-prediction tasks. The results show that symmetric reservoir networks substantially improve prediction accuracy for the convection-based systems, especially when the input dimension is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the shear-flow model displays almost no sensitivity to topological symmetry due to its strongly chaotic high-dimensional dynamics. These findings reveal how structural properties of reservoir networks affect their ability to learn complex dynamics and provide guidance for designing more effective RC architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u50a8\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\uff08\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff09\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9RC\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u65f6\uff1b\u526a\u5207\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5f3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u79f0\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684RC\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The goal of sufficient domestic production capacities has motivated various forms of subsidies, tariffs and other instruments. This paper revisits Warren Buffett's (2003) proposal of tradeable import certificates (TIC) in this context. TIC differ from classical import quotas mainly by linking the import volume to export performance. The certificate price functions like a mix of flexible tariffs and export subsidies whose levels depend on net imports in the strategic sector. We analyse benefits and drawbacks in a simple two-country model. In competitive markets, TIC constitute a transparent and efficient instrument that effectively reduces incentives for other countries to deviate from agreements via hidden subsidies or non-tariff trade barriers. However, TIC can have adverse effects if there are domestic producers with market power in the certificate market.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u6218\u7565\u90e8\u95e8\u4f9b\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6c83\u4f26\u00b7\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u8fdb\u53e3\u8bc1\u4e66\uff08TIC\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5229\u5f0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5371\u673a\u4f7f\u6218\u7565\u90e8\u95e8\u4f9b\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8db3\u591f\u56fd\u5185\u4ea7\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6TIC\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d38\u6613\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4e24\u56fd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5206\u6790TIC\u7684\u5229\u5f0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0cTIC\u662f\u900f\u660e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4ed6\u56fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u853d\u8865\u8d34\u6216\u975e\u5173\u7a0e\u58c1\u5792\u504f\u79bb\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u52a8\u673a\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8bc1\u4e66\u5e02\u573a\u6709\u5177\u6709\u5e02\u573a\u52bf\u529b\u7684\u56fd\u5185\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u65f6\uff0cTIC\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "TIC\u6709\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.\n  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.\n  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.\n  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.\n  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08RDL\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\uff08CDF\uff09\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709RDL\u9700\u7279\u6b8a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5176\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210RDL\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff08FFI\u548cCDF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528CDF\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eCDF\u7684RDL\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u63d2\u4ef6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1RDL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

A survey of progress in space complexity", "categories": ["cs.DS"], "comment": null, "summary": "Algorithm research focuses primarily on how many operations processors need to do (time complexity). But for many problems, both the runtime and energy used are dominated by memory accesses. In this paper, we present the first broad survey of how algorithmic progress has improved memory usage (space complexity). We analyze 118 of the most important algorithm problems in computer science, reviewing the 800+ algorithms used to solve them.\n  Our results show that space complexity has become much more important in recent years as worries have arisen about memory access bottle-necking performance (the ``memory wall''). In 20% of cases we find that space complexity improvements for large problems (n=1 billion) outpaced improvements in DRAM access speed, suggesting that for these problems algorithmic progress played a larger role than hardware progress in minimizing memory access delays. Increasingly, we also see the emergence of algorithmic Pareto frontiers, where getting better asymptotic time complexity for a problem requires getting worse asymptotic space complexity, and vice-versa. This tension implies that programmers will increasingly need to consider multiple algorithmic options to understand which is best for their particular problem.

While the mechanism designer cannot necessarily commit to a particular social choice function in the face of unawareness, she can at least commit to properties of social choice functions such as efficiency given ex post awareness. Assuming quasi-linear utilities and private values, we show that we can implement in conditional dominant strategies a social choice function that is utilitarian ex post efficient under pooled awareness without the need of the social planner being fully aware ex ante. To this end, we develop novel dynamic versions of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms in which true types are revealed and subsequently elaborated at endogenous higher awareness levels.

However, many domain scientists lack the programming expertise required to develop custom data analysis workflows, creating barriers to timely and effective insight. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed.

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff08IoA\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "IoA\u4e2d\u65e0\u7ebf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5411\u9644\u8fd1\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u7528\u591a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005 - \u591a\u8ffd\u968f\u8005Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u786e\u5b9a\u8d44\u6e90\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u8377\u5170\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u8f7d\u56fa\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5411\u7a7a\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3IoA\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We show that this multiplicity reshapes key aspects of trustworthiness. At the individual-model level, sparse interpretable models tend to preserve privacy but are fragile to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate.

While the self-repellent random walk alone is non-Markovian since the jump rates depend on its history via its local time, jointly considering the evolution of the local time profile and the position yields a piecewise deterministic, non-reversible Markov process. We show that this joint process can be interpreted as a second-order lift of a reversible diffusion process, the discrete stochastic heat equation with Gaussian invariant measure. In particular, we obtain a lower bound on the relaxation time of order $\u03a9(n^{3/2})$. Using a flow Poincar\u00e9 inequality, we prove an upper bound for a slightly modified dynamics of order $O(n^2)$, matching recent conjectures in the physics literature. Furthermore, since the self-repellent random walk and its local time process coincide with the Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the harmonic chain, a non-reversible MCMC method, we demonstrate that the relaxation time bound confirms the recent empirical observation that Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithms can outperform traditional MCMC methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u5708\u4e0a\u81ea\u6392\u65a5\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u677e\u5f1b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u5708\u4e0a\u81ea\u6392\u65a5\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u7684\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u6587\u732e\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540cMCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u53ef\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u5e9e\u52a0\u83b1\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u677e\u5f1b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3a$\u03a9(n^{3/2})$\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3a$O(n^2)$\u3002", "conclusion": "\u677e\u5f1b\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMCMC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel rescaled Huberized pinball loss function with asymmetric, non-convex, and smooth properties. Based on this loss function, we develop a corresponding SVM model called RHPSVM (Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss Support Vector Machine). Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility. We transform the non-convex optimization problem of RHPSVM into a series of convex subproblems using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and solve it with the ClipDCD algorithm, which is proven to be convergent.

Besides its lower leakage power, higher density, immunity to radiation-induced particles, and non-volatility, an unintentional bit flip during read operation, referred to as read disturbance error, is a severe reliability challenge in STT-MRAM caches. One major source of read disturbance error in STT-MRAM caches is simultaneous accesses to all tags for parallel comparison operation in a cache set, which has not been addressed in previous work. This paper first demonstrates that high read accesses to tag array extremely increase the read disturbance rate and then proposes a low-cost scheme, so-called Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison (3RSeT), to reduce the error rate by eliminating a significant portion of tag reads. 3RSeT proactively disables the tags that have no chance for hit, using low significant bits of the tags on each access request. Our evaluations using gem5 full-system cycle-accurate simulator show that 3RSeT reduces the read disturbance rate in the tag array by 71.8%, which results in 3.6x improvement in Mean Time To Failure (MTTF).

Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.\n  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u89e3\u7801\u7684PAT\u524d\u7f00\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cTPOT\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8bf7\u6c42\u95f4\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u529b\u5e76\u4f7f\u89e3\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u505c\u6ede\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528pack - forward - merge\u8303\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6253\u5305\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u591a\u5757\u5185\u6838\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u6d41\u8f6c\u53d1\u548cKV\u62c6\u5206\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6c14\u6ce1\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u5728\u7ebfsoftmax\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPAT\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1167.4%\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0bTPOT\u964d\u4f4e13.6 - 83.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "PAT\u4f5c\u4e3avLLM\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation.

The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI.

A comprehensive evaluation was performed based on standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) alongside critical resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results revealed that IF consistently outperformed OC-SVM, achieving higher detection accuracy, superior precision, and recall, along with a significantly better F1-score.

However, the training datasets may be crowdsourced and include sensitive information, such as personal contact details, financial data, and medical records. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on developing privacy-preserving training algorithms for neural networks that maintain good performance while preserving privacy. In this paper, we investigate the generalization and privacy performances of the differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) algorithm, which is a private variant of the gradient descent (GD) by incorporating additional noise into the gradients during each iteration. Moreover, we identify a concrete learning task where DP-GD can achieve superior generalization performance compared to GD in training two-layer Huberized ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, a small signal-to-noise ratio can result in GD producing training models with poor test accuracy, whereas DP-GD can yield training models with good test accuracy and privacy guarantees if the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small. This indicates that DP-GD has the potential to enhance model performance while ensuring privacy protection in certain learning tasks.

We define the objective function and reconstruct \"gold standard\" reference images, and provide metrics for quantifying algorithmic performance. We also received and curated phantom datasets (acquired with different scanners, radionuclides, and phantom types), which we further split into training and evaluation datasets.

The literature shows that the Phillips relationship is fragile and varies across countries and time periods; a statistical relationship that appears strong during one decade (country) may be weak the next (other). This variability might have some grounds for idiosyncrasy of a country and its economic environment. To address it, this paper scrutinizes the Phillips relationship over 41 countries over the period 1980-2016, paying attention to how inflation dynamics behave during tranquil and recessionary periods. As a result, the paper confirms the variability of the Phillips relationship across countries, as well as time periods. It documents that the relationship holds in the majority of developed countries, while it fails to hold in emerging and frontier economies during tranquil periods. On the other hand, the relationship totally collapses during recessionary periods, even in developed markets. This shows that tranquillity of economic environment is significantly important for the Phillip trade-off to work smoothly. Moreover, both backward- and forward-looking fractions of inflation remarkably increase during recessionary periods as a result of the Phillips coefficient loses its significance within the model. This indicates that markets become more inflation-sensitive during these periods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a761980 - 2016\u5e7441\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u65f6\u671f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e73\u7a33\u671f\u548c\u8870\u9000\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u672a\u8fbe\u6210\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u65f6\u671f\u591a\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a761980 - 2016\u5e7441\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u80c0\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u8870\u9000\u671f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u65f6\u671f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5e73\u7a33\u671f\u591a\u6570\u53d1\u8fbe\u56fd\u5bb6\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u548c\u524d\u6cbf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff1b\u8870\u9000\u671f\u5173\u7cfb\u5b8c\u5168\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u8870\u9000\u671f\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u540e\u987e\u548c\u524d\u77bb\u90e8\u5206\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u5e73\u7a33\u5bf9\u83f2\u5229\u666e\u65af\u6743\u8861\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8870\u9000\u671f\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u901a\u80c0\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002"}}

Alpturer, Halpern, and van der Meyden (PODC 2023) introduced the notion of optimality with respect to a limited information exchange, and studied the Eventual Agreement problem in the sending omissions failure model. The present paper studies the Simultaneous Agreement problem for the crash failures model, and a number of limited information exchanges from the literature. In particular, the paper considers information exchanges from a FloodSet protocol (Lynch, Distributed Algorithms 1996), a variant of this in which agents also count the number of failures (Casta\u00f1eda et al, NETYS 2017), and a variant in which agents associate each agent with a value (Raynal, PRDC 2002). A new information exchange is also introduced that enables decisions to be made at worst one round later than the optimal protocol of Dwork and Moses (I&C 88), but with lower computation cost and space requirements.

To account for multi-timescale uncertainties arising from user mobility, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and hardware impairments, our approach decouples the long-term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement from the per-slot beamforming design. By employing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a distribution-free risk metric, a low-complexity algorithm is developed, which combines a surrogate model for efficient deployment with an alternating optimization (AO) scheme for robust real-time beamforming.

A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols.

Given a graph $G$ and a vertex set $X \\subseteq V(G)$, consider the collection of subsets of the form $N(u) \\cap X$ where $u$ ranges over all vertices outside $X$. These intersections, which we call the traces of $X$, capture all ways vertices in $G$ connect to $X$, and in this paper we consider the problem of listing these traces efficiently, and the related problem of recording the multiplicity (frequency) of each trace. For a given query set $X$, both problems have obvious algorithms with running time $O(|N(X)| \\cdot |X|)$ and conditional lower bounds suggest that, on general graphs, one cannot expect better. However, in certain sparse graph classes, more efficient algorithms are possible: Drange \\etal (IPEC 2023) used a data structure that answers trace queries in $d$-degenerate graphs with linear initialisation time and query time that only depends on the query set $X$ and $d$. However, the query time is exponential in $|X|$, which makes this approach impractical. By using a stronger parameter than degeneracy, namely the strong $2$-colouring number $s_2$, we construct a data structure in $O(d \\cdot \\|G\\|)$ time, which answers subsequent trace frequency queries in time $O\\big((d^2 + s_2^{d+2})|X|\\big)$, where $\\|G\\|$ is the number of edges of $G$, $s_2$ is the strong $2$-colouring number and $d$ the degeneracy of a suitable ordering of $G$. We demonstrate that this data structure is indeed practical and that it beats the simple, obvious alternative in almost all tested settings, using a collection of 217 real-world networks with up to 1.1M edges. As part of this effort, we demonstrate that computing an ordering with a small strong $2$-colouring number is feasible with a simple heuristic.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

There is an elegant generalization of this theorem by Monderer and Samet, later refined by Neeman: if a group of agents share a common prior, update their beliefs using Bayesian conditioning on private information, and have common p-belief of their posteriors, these posteriors must be close (i.e., they cannot differ by more than 1 - p). Here, common p-belief generalizes the concept of common knowledge to probabilistic beliefs: agents commonly p-believe an event E if everyone believes E to at least degree p, everyone believes to at least degree p that everyone believes E to at least degree p, and so on.\n  This paper further extends the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem from classical probability measures to plausibility measures -- a very general framework introduced by Halpern that unifies many formal models of belief. To facilitate this extension, we provide a new proof of the Monderer-Samet-Neeman theorem in the classical setting. Building upon both the original proof and our new proof, we offer two different generalizations of the theorem to plausibility-based structures.\n  We then apply these generalized results to several non-classical belief models, including conditional probability structures and lexicographic probability structures. Moreover, we show that whenever our generalized theorems do not apply, the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem fails. These findings suggest that our results successfully identify the minimal conditions required for a belief model to satisfy the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06Monderer - Samet - Neeman\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9a\u7406\u4ece\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f3c\u7136\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5b9a\u7406\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u65f6\u539f\u5b9a\u7406\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06Monderer - Samet - Neeman\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9a\u7406\u4ece\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u5b9a\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4f3c\u7136\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u518d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u5b9a\u7406\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4f3c\u7136\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u5e7f\u5b9a\u7406\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u65f6\u539f\u5b9a\u7406\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6210\u529f\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u6ee1\u8db3Monderer - Samet - Neeman\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches to pure exploration have predominantly relied on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the performance distributions of all alternatives, which limit their applicability to non-sub-Gaussian especially heavy-tailed problems. The need to move beyond sub-Gaussianity may become even more critical in large-scale problems, which tend to be especially sensitive to distributional specifications. In this paper, motivated by the widespread use of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms in pure exploration and beyond, we investigate their performance in the large-scale, non-sub-Gaussian settings. We consider the simplest category of UCB algorithms, where the UCB value for each alternative is defined as the sample mean plus an exploration bonus that depends only on its own sample size. We abstract this into a meta-UCB algorithm and propose letting it select the alternative with the largest sample size as the best upon stopping. For this meta-UCB algorithm, we first derive a distribution-free lower bound on the probability of correct selection. Building on this bound, we analyze two general non-sub-Gaussian scenarios: (1) all alternatives follow a common location-scale structure and have bounded variance; and (2) when such a structure does not hold, each alternative has a bounded absolute moment of order $q > 3$. In both settings, we show that the meta-UCB algorithm and therefore a broad class of UCB algorithms can achieve the sample optimality. These results demonstrate the applicability of UCB algorithms for solving large-scale pure exploration problems with non-sub-Gaussian distributions. Numerical experiments support our results and provide additional insights into the comparative behaviors of UCB algorithms within and beyond our meta-UCB framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u975e\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e0bUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7eaf\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5143UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6837\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7eaf\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u6216\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cd\u5c3e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e0bUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u7684UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u51fa\u5143UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\u7684\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u975e\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5143UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u4e00\u7c7bUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u975e\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7eaf\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The study documents several findings both in country-specific and in panel estimation analysis. First, we find that forward-looking characteristic of inflation picks up weight after 1990's which indicates that inflation became more sensitive to the expected prices. Second, we observe that inflation in developed markets is more forward-looking comparing to emerging and frontier markets. This indicates that developed markets dear forward-looking price expectations more than other markets. Third, we find that that both forward- and backward-looking Phillips Curve fails to work in Brazil, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Romania, and Turkey.

In this paper, we focus on user-level FedRecs, which is a more practical yet challenging setting compared to group-level FedRecs. Adversarial training emerges as the most feasible approach within this context. We identify two key challenges in implementing adversarial training-based attribute unlearning for user-level FedRecs: i) mitigating training instability caused by user data heterogeneity, and ii) preventing attribute information leakage through gradients. To address these challenges, we propose FedAU2, an attribute unlearning method for user-level FedRecs. For CH1, we propose an adaptive adversarial training strategy, where the training dynamics are adjusted in response to local optimization behavior. For CH2, we propose a dual-stochastic variational autoencoder to perturb the adversarial model, effectively preventing gradient-based information leakage.

The framework employs two collaborative agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration and exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. Applied to GPU code optimization -- a domain critical to fields from machine learning to scientific computing -- AUTO generates solutions competitive with expert implementations for chemical kinetics integration and dense matrix multiplication.

The \\emph{temporal exploration problem} asks for the length of the shortest sequence of vertices that starts at a given vertex, visits every vertex, and at each time step $t$ either stays at the current vertex or moves to an adjacent vertex in $G_t$. Bounds on the length of a shortest temporal exploration have been investigated extensively. Perhaps the most fundamental case is when each graph $G_t$ is connected and has bounded maximum degree. In this setting, Erlebach, Kammer, Luo, Sajenko, and Spooner [ICALP 2019] showed that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4})$ time steps. We significantly improve this bound by showing that $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\log n})$ time steps suffice.\n  In fact, we deduce this result from a much more general statement. Let the \\emph{average temporal maximum degree} $D$ of $G$ be the average of $\\max_{t \\in I} d_{G_t}(v)$ over all vertices $v \\in V(G)$, where $d_{G_t}(v)$ denotes the degree of $v$ in $G_t$. If each graph $G_t$ is connected, we show that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{D \\log n})$ time steps. In particular, this gives the first subquadratic upper bound when the underlying graph has bounded average degree. As a special case, this also improves the previous best bounds when the underlying graph is planar or has bounded treewidth and provides a unified approach for all of these settings. Our bound is subquadratic already when $D=o(n/\\log n)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Through an analysis of the axiomatic properties of SkS and of its vulnerability to manipulative and electoral control attacks, we compare SkS with Bucklin voting and provide insights into its potential strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we show that SkS satisfies nondictatorship as well as the majority criterion, positive responsiveness, monotonicity, and citizens' sovereignty but violates the Condorcet criterion, strong monotonicity, independence of clones, consistency, participation, resoluteness, and strategy-proofness. Further, we study manipulation, i.e., where (groups of) voters vote strategically to improve the outcome of an election in their favor, showing that the constructive coalitional weighted manipulation problem for SkS is NP-complete, while the destructive variant can be solved in polynomial time. Lastly, we initiate the study of electoral control, where an external agent attempts to change the election outcome by interfering with the structure of the election. Here, we show NP-completeness for constructive and destructive control by deleting candidates as well as for constructive control by adding voters, whereas we show that the problem of destructive control by adding voters can be solved in polynomial time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u6295\u7968\u7cfb\u7edfSkS\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0eBucklin\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u516c\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u6297\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u8bba\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u9009\u4e3e\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6295\u7968\u7cfb\u7edfSkS\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0eBucklin\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790SkS\u7684\u516c\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u9009\u4e3e\u63a7\u5236\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "result": "SkS\u6ee1\u8db3\u90e8\u5206\u51c6\u5219\u4f46\u8fdd\u53cd\u90e8\u5206\u51c6\u5219\uff1b\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u8054\u76df\u52a0\u6743\u64cd\u7eb5\u95ee\u9898NP - \u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u6027\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u9009\u4e3e\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898NP - \u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SkS\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences.

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior.

In addition, we assessed resource-oriented metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage.

This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback.

We study whether this reporting task is inherently difficult and how reporting interfaces affect accuracy and welfare. In laboratory experiments, we induce preferences over programs via utility over attributes, generating lexicographic, separable, or complementary preferences. We compare three reporting interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship mechanism: (i) a full ranking over programs; (ii) a lexicographic-nesting interface; and (iii) a weighted-attributes interface, the latter two eliciting rankings over attributes rather than programs. We also study the sequential serial dictatorship mechanism that is obviously strategy-proof and simplifies reporting by asking for a single choice at each step. Finally, we run a baseline that elicits a full ranking over programs but rewards pure accuracy rather than allocation outcomes. Four main findings emerge. First, substantial misreporting occurs even in the pure-accuracy baseline and increases with preference complexity. Second, serial dictatorship induces additional mistakes consistent with misperceived incentives. Third, simplified interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship fail to improve (and sometimes reduce) accuracy, even when they match the preference structure. Fourth, sequential choice achieves the highest accuracy while improving efficiency and reducing justified envy.

In contrast, textual document retrieval benefits from robust, standardized evaluation via Cranfield-style test collections, which combine pooled relevance judgments with controlled setups. While recent work shows that adapting this methodology to recommender systems is feasible, constructing such collections remains costly due to the need for manual relevance judgments, thus limiting scalability. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as reliable automatic judges to address these scalability challenges. Using the ML-32M-ext Cranfield-style movie recommendation collection, we first examine the limitations of existing evaluation methodologies. Then we explore the alignment and the recommender systems ranking agreement between the LLM-judge and human provided relevance labels. We find that incorporating richer item metadata and longer user histories improves alignment, and that LLM-judge yields high agreement with human-based rankings (Kendall's tau = 0.87). Finally, an industrial case study in the podcast recommendation domain demonstrates the practical value of LLM-judge for model selection.

These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCosserat\u5fae\u6781\u53ca\u5176\u6d3e\u751f\u5076\u5e94\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6320\u66f2\u78c1\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u4f5c\u7528\u6cdb\u51fd\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u6320\u66f2\u78c1\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u56db\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u5c06\u5e94\u53d8\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u78c1\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5fae\u6781\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u4f4d\u9519\u5f20\u91cf\u4e0e\u78c1\u5316\u77e2\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Lifshitz\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u78c1 - \u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5047\u5b9a\u6320\u66f2\u78c1\u4f5c\u7528\u6cdb\u51fd\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u5177\u6709\u5355\u4e2a\u65b0\u6320\u66f2\u78c1\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b64\u7c7b\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u5bf9\u79f0\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5bf9\u7eb3\u7c73\u6881\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

A fault-tolerant (FT) spanner preserves approximate distances under network failures, often used in applications like network design and distributed systems. While classic (fault-free) spanners are believed to be easily extended to hypergraphs such as by the method of associated graphs, we reveal that this is not the case in the fault-tolerant setting: simple methods can only get a linear size in the maximum number of faults $f$. In contrast, all known optimal size of FT spanners are sublinear in $f$. Inspired by the FT clustering technique, we propose a clustering based algorithm that achieves an improved sublinear size bound. For an $n$-node $m$-edge hypergraph with rank $r$ and a sketch parameter $k$, our algorithm constructs edge FT (EFT) hyperspanners of stretch $2k-1$ and size $O(k^2f^{1-1/(rk)}n^{1+1/k}\\log n)$ with high probability in time $\\widetilde{O}(mr^3+fn)$. We also establish a lower bound of $\u03a9(f^{1-1/r-1/rk}n^{1+1/k-o(1)})$ edges for EFT hyperspanners, which leaves a gap of poly$(k)f^{1/r}$. Finally, we provide an algorithm for constructing additive EFT hyperspanners by combining multiplicative EFT hyperspanners with additive hyperspanners. We believe that our work will spark interest in developing optimal FT spanners for hypergraphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The key novelty is the notion of c-strong belief, a non-standard, \"cautious\" version of strong belief (Battigalli and Siniscalchi 2002, JET). Our formulation of prudent rationalizability embodies a \"best rationalization principle\" similar to the one that underlies the solution concept of strong rationalizability. The main results show the equivalence between the proposed definition with the one originally put forth by Heifetz et al. (2021) in terms of conditional beliefs represented by standard probabilities.

They help guide responsible vulnerability reporting and build trust among users and contributors. Despite their growing use, it is still unclear how these policies influence the structure and evolution of software dependencies. Software dependencies are external packages or libraries that a project relies on, and their interconnected nature affects both functionality and security. This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates.

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

PDE-FM combines spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone with an operator-theoretic decoder, enabling scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. In contrast to task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM is pretrained once on diverse PDE datasets and can be transferred to new physical regimes without architectural or data-specific modifications. Evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark - spanning hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena - PDE-FM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. The model demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong performance in linear and steady-state regimes. These results suggest that large-scale pretraining across diverse physical processes can yield transferable representations of dynamics, marking a step toward unified, foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPDE - FM\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u5f02\u6784PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4 - \u9891\u8c31\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u3001\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2a2D\u548c3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u516d\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747VRMSE\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e46%\uff0c\u8de8\u7269\u7406\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u591a\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Uni-modal choices are those when the outcomes being compared over time are very similar, and cross-modal choices are those when the outcomes are very different. The cross-modal effect, previously shown in the U.S., is that there is greater patience in cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 1, we employed a between-participants design, in which participants either made uni-modal or cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 2, we employed a within-participants design in which everyone made both types of decision. In both Experiments we replicated the cross-modal effect. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect did not vary with factors known to relate to time preference, such as cognitive ability and social status, and it did not differ across cultures, even though Japanese participants were much more patient than American ones. The effect was stronger in the between- than within-participants experiment. These results strengthen the conclusion that the cross-modal effect is universal and strengthens the argument that it is due to the fundamental process of attentional dilution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u671f\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8de8\u671f\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u6001\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c1\u91c7\u7528\u7ec4\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c2\u91c7\u7528\u7ec4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u590d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u7b49\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u95f4\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.\n  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.\n  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.\n  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.\n  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f\u7684MMC\u7b97\u6cd5RT - MMC\uff0c\u5229\u7528GPU\u7684RT\u5185\u6838\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MMC\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5c04\u7ebf - \u8fb9\u754c\u76f8\u4ea4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNVIDIA\u7684OptiX\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0RT - MMC\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u5f62\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7ba1\u9053\u81f3\u6df7\u6d4a\u4ecb\u8d28\u4f53\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "RT - MMC\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u591aGPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.5 - 4.5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aMMC\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5230\u786c\u4ef6\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b80\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u5f62\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7ba1\u9053\u5229\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability.

However, existing attribution methods rely heavily on the heuristic methods, e.g., Last-Click Mechanism (LCM) which always allocates the attribution to the platform with the latest report, lacking theoretical guarantees for attribution accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical model for the advertising attribution problem, in which we aim to design the optimal dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanisms and evaluate their performance. We first show that LCM is not DSIC and performs poorly in terms of accuracy and fairness. To address this limitation, we introduce the Peer-Validated Mechanism (PVM), a DSIC mechanism in which a platform's attribution depends solely on the reports of other platforms.

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u5931\u8d25\u4ee3\u7406\u5171\u540c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty.

We prove that in the bias-dominated regime ($\u03b2\\ge 1/2$), which corresponds to large subsample sizes typically favored in practice to maximize predictive accuracy, standard inference breaks down as the estimator converges to a deterministic bias constant rather than a zero-mean normal distribution. Finally, we derive the explicit analytic form of this asymptotic bias and discuss the theoretical feasibility of restoring valid inference via analytic bias correction. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between predictive performance and inferential validity, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the intrinsic limitations of random forest inference in high-dimensional settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u68ee\u6797\uff08QRF\uff09\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u6e10\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u2018\u76f8\u53d8\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u6548\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "QRF\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u504f\u5dee - \u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Knight\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u5f39\u7403\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acbQRF\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6b63\u6001\u6027\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u03b2\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u2018\u76f8\u53d8\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\uff08\u03b2\u22651/2\uff09\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u65ad\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u5230\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5e38\u6570\u800c\u975e\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5bfc\u51fa\u6e10\u8fd1\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We develop a simple model in which monitoring is a public good on a network with strategic complementarities. A regulator chooses between decentralized monitoring (cheaper, local oversight) and centralized monitoring (more costly, but internalizing spillovers). The model delivers an endogenous centralization threshold: for a given spillover strength, there exists a network size $n^\\ast(\u03bb)$ above which centralized monitoring strictly dominates; equivalently, for a given network size $n$, there is a critical complementarity $\u03bb^\\ast(n)$ beyond which decentralized oversight becomes fragile. A stochastic extension suggests that, above this region, idiosyncratic shocks are amplified, producing stronger peer correlations, higher variance, and more frequent deterioration in quality. We test these predictions in the U.S. nursing home sector, where facilities belong to overlapping organizational (chain) and geographic (county) networks. Using CMS facility data, We document strong within-chain and within-county peer effects and estimate network-size thresholds for severe regulatory failure (Special Focus Facility designations).

However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized.

Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns.

Given a CSP instance and two of its solutions, RCSP asks whether one solution can be transformed into the other via a sequence of intermediate solutions, each differing by the assignment of a single variable. RCSP has attracted growing interest in theoretical computer science, and when the variable domain is Boolean, the computational complexity of RCSP exhibits a dichotomy depending on the allowed constraint types. A notable special case is the reconfiguration of graph homomorphisms -- also known as graph recoloring -- which has been studied using topological methods.

Recent research has explored merging mechanisms for e-commerce platforms, but none have simultaneously achieved all desirable properties: incentive compatibility, individual rationality, adaptability to multiple slots, integration of inseparable candidates, and avoidance of repeated exposure for ads and organic items. This paper addresses the design of a merging mechanism that satisfies all these properties. We first provide the necessary conditions for the optimal merging mechanisms.

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge.

This gap limits our understanding of the properties of the gradient estimators and the associated optimization algorithms, thereby constraining opportunities to improve training stability and overall performance. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients.

These insights motivate Optimal Baseline and Learning-Rate Policy Optimization (OBLR-PO), an algorithm that jointly adapts learning rates and baselines in a theoretically grounded manner.

Nevertheless, the deterrence effect of stigma on undesirable sexual behaviours has long been overlooked. This study adapts the existing framework on HIV stigma with an additional stage that formally models people's choices on whether to take preventive measures in sex. The model shows that, when sex is explicitly modelled, the suppression and deterrence effects coexist, which makes the net societal impact of HIV stigma ambiguous. A utilitarian welfare analysis concludes that the welfare-maximizing stigma level can be higher than its natural level, implying that the government's effort to reduce stigma is not always welfare-improving.

By allowing multiple proposers per slot and organizing blocks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), Areon achieves robustness under partial synchrony. Blocks reference each other within a sliding window, forming maximal antichains that represent parallel ``votes'' on history. Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.\n  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability. We focus on consensus at the level of blocks; extending the framework to richer transaction selection, sampling, and redundancy policies is left to future work.\n  Finally, we build a discrete-event simulator and compare Areon-Base against a chain-based baseline (Ouroboros Praos) under matched block-arrival rates.

In this paper, we study the computational complexity of solution discovery for several fundamental vertex-subset problems on graphs, namely Vertex Cover Discovery, Independent Set Discovery, Dominating Set Discovery, and Feedback Vertex Set Discovery. We first present XP algorithms for all four problems parameterized by clique-width.

In multimodal machine learning, choosing the strategy for fusing data together requires careful consideration of the application's accuracy and latency requirements, as fusing the data at earlier or later stages in the model architecture can lead to performance changes in accuracy and latency. To demonstrate this tradeoff, we investigate different fusion strategies using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework that integrates image and text data. We explore two different vision networks: MobileNetV2 and ViT. We propose three models for each vision network, which fuse data at late, intermediate, and early stages in the architecture. We evaluate the proposed models on the CMU MOSI dataset and benchmark their latency on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. Our experimental results demonstrate that while late fusion yields the highest accuracy, early fusion offers the lowest inference latency.

In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time.

Its aim is to determine whether this law, formulated by Marx in Capital (Vol. III), continues to operate in the contemporary context. The methodology consists of transforming orthodox macroeconomic categories derived from the Spanish National Accounts (CNE), available in BDMACRO, into Marxist variables: constant capital ($c$), variable capital ($v$), and surplus value ($pv$). Based on these, historical series of the organic composition of capital ($q$), the rate of surplus value ($pv'$), and the rate of profit ($g'$) are constructed, adjusted to constant prices to ensure temporal coherence and comparability. The results show a sustained increase in $q$ and a slight decrease in $pv'$, generating a tendential decline in $g'$ with cyclical fluctuations associated with specific crises.

However, its computation and communication processes remain sequential, resulting in limited system efficiency. To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization.

(ESA 2016, OR 2020). In this problem, requests arrive over time at the vertices of a given vertex-weighted tree, and each request has a deadline that it must be served by. The cost of serving a request equals the cost of a path from the root to the vertex where the request resides. Instead of serving each request individually, requests can be aggregated and served by transmitting a subtree from the root that spans the vertices on which the requests reside, to potentially be more cost-effective. The aggregated cost is the weight of the transmission subtree. The goal of MLAP-D is to find an aggregation solution that minimizes the total cost while serving all requests.\n  We present improved and parameterized algorithms for MLAP-D. Our result is twofold. First, we present an $e(D+1)$-competitive algorithm where $D$ is the depth of the tree. Second, we present an $e(4H+2)$-competitive algorithm where $H$ is the caterpillar dimension of the tree. Here, $H \\le D$ and $H \\le \\log_2 |V|$ where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the given tree. The caterpillar dimension remains constant for rich but simple classes of trees, such as line graphs ($H=1$), caterpillar graphs ($H=2$), and lobster graphs ($H=3$). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online algorithm parameterized on a measure better than depth. The state-of-the-art online algorithms are $6(D+1)$-competitive by Buchbinder, Feldman, Naor, and Talmon (SODA 2017) and $O(\\log |V|)$-competitive by Azar and Touitou (FOCS 2020).

We define ExtremelyBuggy methods as those involved in more than one bug fix and present the first large-scale study of their prevalence, characteristics, and predictability. Using a dataset of over 1.25 million methods from 98 open-source Java projects, we find that ExtremelyBuggy methods constitute only a tiny fraction of all methods, yet frequently account for a disproportionately large share of bugs. At their inception, these methods are significantly larger, more complex, less readable, and less maintainable than both singly-buggy and non-buggy methods. However, despite these measurable differences, a comprehensive evaluation of five machine learning models shows that early prediction of ExtremelyBuggy methods remains highly unreliable due to data imbalance, project heterogeneity, and the fact that many bugs emerge through subsequent evolution rather than initial implementation. To complement these quantitative findings, we conduct a thematic analysis of 265 ExtremelyBuggy methods, revealing recurring visual issues (e.g., confusing control flow, poor readability), contextual roles (e.g., core logic, data transformation, external resource handling), and common defect patterns (e.g., faulty conditionals, fragile error handling, misuse of variables). These results highlight the need for richer, evolution-aware representations of code and provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to prioritize high-risk methods early in the development lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21 bug \u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5360\u6bd4\u5c0f\u4f46\u95ee\u9898\u591a\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u53cd\u590d\u5438\u5f15 bug \u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 98 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90 Java \u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8d85 125 \u4e07\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c 265 \u4e2a\u6781\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21 bug \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6781\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6b21 bug \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5360\u6bd4\u5c0f\u4f46\u95ee\u9898\u591a\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u8003\u8651\u4ee3\u7801\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e9\u671f\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes.

To counteract the effects of adversarial illusions, we propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs the input from the attacker's perturbed input through generative models, e.g., Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to maintain natural alignment. To further enhance our proposed defense mechanism, we adopt a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation scheme over the outcomes of the generated samples. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders show that our approach substantially reduces the illusion attack success rates to near-zero and improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (42 to 46) and 11% (32 to 43) in unperturbed and perturbed input settings respectively, providing an effective and model-agnostic defense against adversarial illusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u8bef\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VAE\uff09\u4ece\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u9ad84%\uff08\u4ece42\u523046\uff09\u548c11%\uff08\u4ece32\u523043\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel showed that no non-constant function $f(x,y)$ can be computed correctly by two parties using content-oblivious communication over a single edge, where one party holds $x$ and the other holds $y$.

The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains.

Through extensive simulations of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we first establish a baseline dyadic interaction matrix, revealing nuanced cooperative preferences between all 16 personality pairs. We then demonstrate that macro-level cooperative outcomes are not predictable from dyadic interactions alone; they are co-determined by the network's connectivity and the spatial distribution of personalities. For instance, we find that small-world networks are detrimental to cooperation, while strategically placing pro-social personalities in hub positions within scale-free networks can significantly promote cooperative behavior.

Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\\% of total time).

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4ece\u5934\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u5e8f\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u3001\u5e8f\u5217 - \u7ed3\u6784 - \u529f\u80fd\u8026\u5408\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u6b8b\u57fa\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u03b1\u87ba\u65cb\u548c\u5377\u66f2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u666f\u89c2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6 GPU \u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Electron density maps -- the direct output of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy -- offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative. We compare three voxel-based input types for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs): atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two molecular tasks -- protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9, where labels are derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs still outperform atom-based ones at scale, reflecting the rich structural and electronic information encoded in density. Overall, these results highlight the task- and regime-dependent strengths of density-derived inputs, improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f833D CNN\u4e09\u79cd\u4f53\u7d20\u8f93\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u884d\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u76843D\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u5fae\u5999\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u662f\u66f4\u4f18\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f833D CNN\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u4f53\u7d20\u8f93\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u539f\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28 - \u914d\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728PDBbind\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5404\u8868\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5728QM9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bc6\u5ea6\u884d\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.\n  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score.

These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \\emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \\emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \\emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \\emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \\textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \\emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule.

Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters.

However, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, which makes many common quantum algorithms inapplicable. Recently, a quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm was proposed for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra [FOCS 65, 1051 (2024)]. Here we investigate the cost of this algorithm applied to transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians of second-row atoms and compare it to the cost of applying standard qubitization to non-transcorrelated Hamiltonians. We find that the ground state energy of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian in the STO-6G basis is more accurate than that of a standard Hamiltonian in the cc-pVQZ basis. The T gate counts of the two methods are comparable, while the qubit count of the transcorrelated method is 2.5 times smaller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001T\u95e8\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c0f\u57fa\u7ec4\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u4f7f\u5e38\u89c1\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728STO - 6G\u57fa\u7ec4\u4e2d\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4cc - pVQZ\u57fa\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5T\u95e8\u8ba1\u6570\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u5c0f2.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this work, we study these human-AI ecosystems from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the classical framework of repeated pricing games. In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80cc\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u8c0b\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u80cc\u79bb\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5408\u8c0b\u5e76\u538b\u4f4e\u4ef7\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76AI\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ef4\u6301\u8d85\u7ade\u4e89\u4ef7\u683c\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80cc\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u590d\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u7ecf\u5178\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAI\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u52a8\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff08\u80cc\u79bb\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u80cc\u79bb\u5c31\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u5408\u8c0b\u5e76\u538b\u4f4e\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u80cc\u79bb\u4f7f\u4ef7\u683c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ade\u4e89\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u80cc\u79bb\u610f\u8bc6\u7684AI\u4e0b\u5408\u8c0b\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u5728AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u8c0b\u4f55\u65f6\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u3002"}}

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSBERT\u548cSimCSE\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6TSRCDF - SS\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SBERT\u548cSimCSE\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u5143\u7d20\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u524d\u9988\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u57df\u5185\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b8fF1\u548c\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad810.4%\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b8fF1\u63d0\u9ad811.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TSRCDF - SS\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts.

This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window.

Although overcapacity is traditionally seen as problematic, it could unlock EIIs' flexibility in electricity use. Using China's aluminum smelting sector as a case, we evaluate the system-level cost-benefit of retaining EII overcapacity for flexible electricity use in decarbonized systems. We find that overcapacity enables smelters to adopt a seasonal operation paradigm, ceasing production during winter load peaks driven by heating electrification and renewable seasonality. In a 2050-net-zero scenario, this paradigm reduces China's electricity-system investment and operating costs by 15-72 billion CNY per year (8-34% of the industry's product value), enough to offset the costs of maintaining overcapacity and product storage. Seasonal operation also cuts workforce fluctuations across aluminum smelting and thermal-power sectors by up to 62%, potentially mitigating socio-economic disruptions from industrial restructuring and the energy transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ee5\u4e2d\u56fd\u94dd\u51b6\u70bc\u884c\u4e1a\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4ea7\u80fd\u8fc7\u5269\u7528\u4e8e\u7075\u6d3b\u7528\u7535\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u91c7\u7528\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u8fd0\u8425\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4ea7\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u964d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea7\u80fd\u8fc7\u5269\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea7\u80fd\u8fc7\u5269\u53ef\u91ca\u653e\u5176\u7528\u7535\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fdd\u7559\u4ea7\u80fd\u8fc7\u5269\u5728\u8131\u78b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u7528\u7535\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u4e2d\u56fd\u94dd\u51b6\u70bc\u884c\u4e1a\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u4ea7\u80fd\u8fc7\u5269\u4f7f\u51b6\u70bc\u5382\u53ef\u91c7\u7528\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u8fd0\u8425\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u57282050\u5e74\u51c0\u96f6\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c150 - 720\u4ebf\u5143\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6ce2\u52a8\u8fbe62%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u8fd0\u8425\u6a21\u5f0f\u8282\u7701\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8db3\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea7\u80fd\u8fc7\u5269\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u50a8\u5b58\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u4ea7\u4e1a\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

Among these, a novel paradigm called History Covert Channels (HCC) leverages past network events as reference points to embed covert messages. Unlike traditional timing- or storage-based CCs, which directly manipulate traffic patterns or packet contents, HCCs minimize detectability by encoding information through small pointers to historical data. This approach enables them to amplify the size of transmitted covert data by referring to more bits than are actually embedded. Recent research has explored the feasibility of such methods, demonstrating their potential to evade detection by repurposing naturally occurring network behaviors as a covert transmission medium.\n  This paper introduces a novel method for establishing and maintaining covert communication links using relative pointers to network timing patterns, which minimizes the reliance of the HCC on centralized timekeeping and reduces the likelihood of being detected by standard network monitoring tools. We also explore the tailoring of HCCs to optimize their robustness and undetectability characteristics. Our experiments reveal a better bitrate compared to previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9a\u65f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5bf9\u6307\u9488\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316HCC\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9690\u853d\u901a\u9053\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cHistory Covert Channels\uff08HCC\uff09\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u4e2d\u8ba1\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9a\u65f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6307\u9488\u5efa\u7acb\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u5bf9HCC\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11HCC\u5bf9\u96c6\u4e2d\u8ba1\u65f6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In litigation, expert commissioners, such as physicians, architects, accountants, and engineers, provide specialized knowledge to help judges clarify points of dispute. When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand.

When the subset $X$ is of size $p$ (resp. at most $p$), this operation is called an $(=p)$-inversion (resp. $(\\leq p)$-inversion). Then, an oriented graph is $(=p)$-invertible if it can be made acyclic by a sequence of $p$-inversions. We observe that, for $n=|V(D)|$, deciding whether $D$ is $(=n-1)$-invertible is equivalent to deciding whether $D$ is acyclically pushable, and thus NP-complete. In all other cases, when $p \\neq n-1$, we construct a polynomial-time algorithm to decide $(=p)$-invertibility.\n  We then consider the $(= p)$-inversion number, $\\text{inv}^{= p}(D)$ (resp. $(\\leq p)$-inversion number, $\\text{inv}^{\\leq p}(D)$), defined as the minimum number of $(=p)$-inversions (resp. $(\\leq p)$-inversions) rendering $D$ acyclic. We show that every $(=p)$-invertible digraph $D$ satisfies $\\text{inv}^{= p}(D) \\leq |A(D)|$ for every integer $p\\geq 2$. When $p$ is even, we bound $\\text{inv}^{= p}$ by a (linear) function of the feedback arc set number, and rule out the existence of any bounding function for odd $p$.\n  Finally, we study the complexity of deciding whether the $(= p)$-inversion number, or the $(\\leq p)$-inversion number, of a given oriented graph is at most a given integer $k$. For any fixed positive integer $p \\geq 2$, when $k$ is part of the input, we show that both problems are NP-hard even in tournaments.

Our Digital Twin, named Access Point Digital Twin (APDT) is used for tracking user behavior and changing bandwidth demands, directly impacting network performance and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like latency, jitter, etc. APDT captures the real-time state of networks with data from access points (APs), enabling simulation-based analyses and predictive modelling. APDT facilitates the simulation of various what-if scenarios thereby providing a better understanding of various aspects of the network characteristics. We tested APDT on our University network. APDT uses data collected from three access points via the Ruckus SmartZone API and incorporates NS-3 based simulations. The simulation replicates a real-time snapshot from a Ruckus access point and models metrics such as latency and inter-packet transfer time. Additionally, a forecasting model predicts traffic congestion and suggests proactive client offloading, enhancing network management and performance optimization.

In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins.

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7528CNN\u4ece\u8fdc\u89c6\u89d2\u8def\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5bf9\u884c\u4eba\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u7279\u5f81\u8f85\u52a9\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u62e5\u5835\u8def\u53e3\u884c\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u884c\u4eba\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8fbe\u5361\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8def\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0ResNet50\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u516b\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "ResNet50\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u548cSGD\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe86.19%\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u51c6\u786e\u738784.15%\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u5feb\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u76d1\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time.

Evaluation of the prototype revealed limitations, including the computational cost of message passing, complexity of error handling, and code redundancy due to iterative development. Experimental results confirmed the correct implementation of the core CASCADE algorithms and informed the design of future improvements.

This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade.

In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augment existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop-directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO).

Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions.

Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u4e49 ID \u5e8f\u5217\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u4e49 ID \u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u504f\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u4e49 ID \u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u63a9\u7801\u566a\u58f0\u5b66\u4e60\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ec\u56de\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49 ID\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

We build upon the work of Choo et al. (ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $\u03b2$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $\u03b1n$ for any constant $0 < \u03b1\\le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(\u03b2-o(1))$-robustness.

For this reason, security-oriented disciplines of signal processing have received increasing attention in the last decades: multimedia forensics, digital watermarking, biometrics, network monitoring, steganography and steganalysis are just a few examples. Even though each of these fields has its own peculiarities, they all have to deal with a common problem: the presence of one or more adversaries aiming at making the system fail. Adversarial Signal Processing lays the basis of a general theory that takes into account the impact that the presence of an adversary has on the design of effective signal processing tools. By focusing on the application side of Adversarial Signal Processing, namely adversarial information fusion in distributed sensor networks, and adopting a game-theoretic approach, this thesis contributes to the above mission by addressing four issues. First, we address decision fusion in distributed sensor networks by developing a novel soft isolation defense scheme that protect the network from adversaries, specifically, Byzantines. Second, we develop an optimum decision fusion strategy in the presence of Byzantines.

However, the structural design of these varied services, along with their reliance on auto-scalers for dynamic internet traffic, introduces significant coordination challenges. As we demonstrate in this paper, common default retry patterns used between misaligned services can turn into retry storms which drive up resource usage and costs, leading to self-inflicted Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) scenarios. To overcome these problems we introduce RetryGuard, a distributed framework for productive control of retry patterns across interdependent microservices. By managing retry policy on a per-service basis and making parallel decisions, RetryGuard prevents retry storms, curbs resource contention, and mitigates escalating operational costs. RetryGuard makes its decisions based on an analytic model that captures the relationships among retries, throughput (rejections), delays, and costs. Experimental results show that RetryGuard significantly reduces resource usage and costs compared to AWS standard and advanced retry policies. We further demonstrate its scalability and superior performance in a more complex Kubernetes deployment with the Istio service mesh, where it achieves substantial improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u534f\u8c03\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u91cd\u8bd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdRetryGuard\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u4f38\u7f29\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u91cd\u8bd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8bd5\u98ce\u66b4\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RetryGuard\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6309\u670d\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u91cd\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5e76\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u505a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eAWS\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u91cd\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRetryGuard\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742Kubernetes\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "RetryGuard\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u91cd\u8bd5\u98ce\u66b4\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8d44\u6e90\u4e89\u7528\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis.\n  We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods. These paths are then translated into instructions that guide runtime app exploration.\n  On the AndroTest benchmark, GAPS statically identifies paths to reach 88.24\\% of the target methods in just 4.27 seconds per app and dynamically reaches 57.44\\% of them. In contrast, state-of-the-art dynamic interaction tools show significantly lower reachability over three runs: APE, one of the best model-based GUI testers, achieves 12.82\\%, while GoalExplorer, a hybrid analysis tool, reaches 9.69\\%, and Guardian, an LLM-based UI automator, reaches 17.12\\%. Static analysis tools also fall short: FlowDroid and DroidReach identify paths to reach 58.81\\% and 9.48\\% of the targets, requiring 35.06 seconds and 23.46 seconds per app, respectively.\n  Finally, an evaluation on the 50 most downloaded real-world apps demonstrates GAPS's practical utility in analyzing security-critical code under a realistic scenario.

Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies.

A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects.

However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier.

However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks.

Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost.

While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts.

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8eC - VEP\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0fBCI\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u591a\u7c7bSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u57fa\u4e8eC - VEP\u7684BCI\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e63\u4f4dm\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001Siamese\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eCCA\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u8bb0\u5f5513\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u95ea\u70c1\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684EEG\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u4e2dEMD\u548c\u53d7\u9650EMD\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u591a\u7c7bSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738796.89%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0fBCI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5355\u8bd5\u9a8cC - VEP\u89e3\u7801\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary.

This study investigates novice programmers' emotional experiences in informal settings, identifies the causes of emotional struggle, and explores design opportunities for affect-aware support systems. We manually annotated 1,500 posts from r/learnprogramming using the Learning-Centered Emotions framework and conducted clustering and axial coding. Confusion, curiosity, and frustration were the most common emotions, often co-occurring and associated with early learning stages. Positive emotions were relatively rare.

Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance.

Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance.

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated.

The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u6c14\u6c34\u5faa\u73af\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u7ecf\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u5317\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u62a5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0fAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u5c06\u5927\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u9884\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u77ed\u65f6\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u9884\u62a5\u3001\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u6c34\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u54cd\u5e94\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e14\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d2f\u7a7f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u62a5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u4e34\u754c\u6210\u529f\u6307\u6570\u548c\u9884\u8b66\u63d0\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4eba\u53e3\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u758f\u6563\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0fAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5927\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u9884\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08fastDSA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5ffd\u7565\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6162\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u9608\u503c\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9Hankel\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u9636\u6570\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u6362\u6162\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "fastDSA\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5c11\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5176\u5148\u8f88\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "fastDSA\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the inherent variability of EEG signals due to psychological and physical factors necessitates a cumbersome calibration process. In particular, the inter-subject variability of EEG signals leads to a domain shift problem, which makes it challenging to generalize drowsiness detection models to unseen target subjects. To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time. In addition, we introduce prototype learning to ensure robust predictions against distribution shifts over time. We validated our method on the sustained-attention driving dataset collected in a simulated environment, where drowsiness was estimated from delayed reaction times during monotonous lane-keeping tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines, achieving an average F1-score of 81.73\\%, an improvement of 11.73\\% over the best TTA baseline.

Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7d27\u51d1\u98ce\u683c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSLPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cORION\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u4eba\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u800c\u5197\u957f\u7684\u2018\u601d\u8003\u2019\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u601d\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u5047\u8bbe\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7d27\u51d1\u98ce\u683c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "ORION\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u6807\u8bb0\u51cf\u5c114 - 16\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe5\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e7 - 9\u500d\uff0c\u4fdd\u630190 - 98%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85Claude\u548cChatGPT - 4o\u8fbe5%\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u8fbe2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u671d\u7740\u7c7b\u4eba\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u8fc8\u8fdb\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Although regulatory measures have reduced air pollutants, fossil fuels remain a significant component of the energy supply, highlighting the need for more advanced demand-side approaches to reduce the public health impacts. To enable health-informed demand-side management, we introduce HealthPredictor, a domain-specific AI model that provides an end-to-end pipeline linking electricity use to public health outcomes. The model comprises three components: a fuel mix predictor that estimates the contribution of different generation sources, an air quality converter that models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, and a health impact assessor that translates resulting pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Across multiple regions in the United States, our health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors in terms of public health impacts than fuel mix-driven baselines. A case study on electric vehicle charging schedules illustrates the public health gains enabled by our method and the actionable guidance it can offer for health-informed energy management.

While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/\u03c4$ rate, where $\u03c4$ is the number of iterations. We also establish a nearly matching lower bound on the convergence rate in this regime.

Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales.

Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains.

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue.

Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods, particularly using the same queries from the simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08QBO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u673a\u8eab\u88c5\u914d\u5f62\u72b6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51faQBO\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5236\u9020\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQBO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5UCB\u4e3a\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u8f93\u5165\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cQBO\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "QBO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u673a\u8eab\u88c5\u914d\u5f62\u72b6\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6MCTR\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728Atari\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51faMCTR\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u53cc\u91cd\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\uff0cMCTR\u542b\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572845\u4e2aAtari\u6e38\u620f\uff0833\u4e2a\u89c1\u8fc7\uff0c12\u4e2a\u6ca1\u89c1\u8fc7\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cMCTR\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d9/12\u83b7\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "conclusion": "MCTR\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5143\u63a8\u7406\u671d\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance.

Don't flag it as plagiarism. I wanna post my paper on arxiv", "summary": "Dynamic sleep mode optimization (SMO) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks is essential for maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. However, existing optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches rely on aggregated, static base station (BS) traffic models that fail to capture non-stationary traffic dynamics and suffer from large state-action spaces, limiting real-world deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), referred to as MARL-DDQN, for adaptive SMO in a 3D urban environment with a time-varying and community-based user equipment (UE) mobility model. Unlike conventional single-agent RL, MARL-DDQN enables scalable, distributed decision-making with minimal signaling overhead. A realistic BS power consumption model and beamforming are integrated to accurately quantify EE, while QoS is defined in terms of throughput. The method adapts SMO policies to maximize EE while mitigating inter-cell interference and ensuring throughput fairness. Simulations show that MARL-DDQN outperforms state-of-the-art strategies, including All On, iterative QoS-aware load-based (IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG, and MARL-PPO, achieving up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule EE, 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and meeting QoS constraints 95% of the time under dynamic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u7761\u7720\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7684MARL - DDQN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6d41\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u72b6\u6001 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARL - DDQN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u7ad9\u529f\u8017\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u4ee5\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5b9a\u4e49QoS\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7761\u7720\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793aMARL - DDQN\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u8fbe0.60 Mbit/Joule\uff0c\u7b2c10\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8fbe8.5 Mbps\uff0c95%\u65f6\u95f4\u6ee1\u8db3QoS\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "MARL - DDQN\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u7761\u7720\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3QoS\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning.

Integrating the neural decoder in the implant is an effective data compression method for future wireless iBMIs. However, the non-stationarity of the system makes the performance of the decoder unreliable. To avoid frequent retraining of the decoder and to ensure the safety and comfort of the iBMI user, continuous learning is essential for real-life applications. Since Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are being recognized as a promising approach for developing resource-efficient neural decoder, we propose continuous learning approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms adapted for DSNNs. Banditron and AGREL are chosen as the two candidate RL algorithms since they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively addressing the non-stationary problem and fitting the energy constraints of implantable devices. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The accuracy of open-loop experiments conducted with DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL remains stable over extended periods. Meanwhile, the time-to-target in the closed-loop experiment with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to that of DSNN AGREL while achieving reductions of 98% in memory access usage and 99% in the requirements for multiply- and-accumulate (MAC) operations during training.

Variations such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications, making accurate modeling essential for space weather forecasting. While 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are used to simulate and investigate these variations in the solar wind, they tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness in investigating the impacts of boundary condition uncertainty. In this work, we develop a surrogate for steady state solar wind modeling, using a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). We compare our model to a previously developed numerical surrogate for this task called HUX, and we show that the SFNO achieves comparable or better performance across several metrics. Though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness, this underscores the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than a flaw in SFNO.

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment.

Existing imputation methods often fail to capture complex structural dependencies and handle heterogeneous data effectively.

IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph to represent sample-feature relationships and applies graph representation learning to model structural dependencies. A key innovation is its \\textit{dual-decoder architecture}, where one decoder reconstructs feature embeddings and the other models missingness patterns, providing structural priors aware of missing mechanisms. To better encode categorical variables, we introduce a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module that avoids high-dimensional one-hot encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets show that IVGAE achieves consistent improvements in RMSE and downstream F1 across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing scenarios under 30\\% missing rates.

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues.

Variants of PCA are simple and interpretable, but not flexible enough to capture nonlinear data manifold structure. More flexible approaches have other problems: autoencoders are generally difficult to interpret, and graph-embedding-based methods can produce pathological distortions in manifold geometry. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a variational framework that casts dimensionality reduction algorithms as solutions to an optimal manifold embedding problem. By construction, this framework permits nonlinear embeddings, allowing its solutions to be more flexible than PCA. Moreover, the variational nature of the framework has useful consequences for interpretability: each solution satisfies a set of partial differential equations, and can be shown to reflect symmetries of the embedding objective. We discuss these features in detail and show that solutions can be analytically characterized in some cases.

However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \\emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5dee\uff08PVar\uff09\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6536\u96c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76PVar\u5bf9DPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbDPO\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53d7PVar\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1PVar\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u4f4ePVar\u63d0\u793a\uff1bPVar\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7a33\u5065\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u524d10%\u9ad8PVar\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5dee\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u6548\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u793a\u4f8b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average.

We take a different route: rescheduling the sampling timeline of a frozen sampler. Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u51bb\u7ed3\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u7ebf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u904d\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eJames - Stein\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c5\u6b65Flux - Dev\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u6316\u6398\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u975e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u53caSLERP\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0cSLERP\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u975e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSLERP\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790kmeans\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\uff1bSLERP\u5408\u5e76\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "SLERP\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u5904\u7406LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

While most existing FL methods assume homogeneous model architectures, client heterogeneity in data and resources renders this assumption impractical, motivating model-heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead.

Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods.

The OMD iterates are defined as solutions to optimization subproblems which, oftentimes, can be solved only approximately, leading to an inexact version of the algorithm. Nonetheless, existing OMD analyses typically assume an idealized error free setting, thereby limiting our understanding of performance guarantees that should be expected in practice. In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u5728\u7ebf\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff08OMD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OMD\u5206\u6790\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786eOMD\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u9057\u61be\u7684\u754c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u969c\u788d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u4e14\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u4e3a\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u4e00\u81f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u8d85\u989d\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7d27\u754c\uff1b\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8d1f\u71b5\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u969c\u788d\u548cTsallis\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b\u635f\u5931\u968f\u673a\u4e14\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u4e3a\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u65f6\u8d1f\u71b5\u6062\u590d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786eOMD\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u53d7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u635f\u5931\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Despite their growing sophistication, most dynamic pricing algorithms focus on optimizing the price of each product independently, disregarding potential interactions among items. By neglecting these interdependencies in consumer demand across related goods, sellers may fail to capture the full potential of coordinated pricing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring dynamic pricing mechanisms designed explicitly for complementary products, aiming to exploit their joint demand structure to maximize overall revenue. We present an online learning algorithm considering both positive and negative interactions between products' demands.

We present \\textbf{EulerESG}, an LLM-powered system for automating ESG disclosure analysis with explicit awareness of ESG frameworks.

Traditional FL methods often use a global model to fit all clients, assuming that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, when this assumption does not hold, the global model accuracy may drop significantly, limiting FL applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FLUX, a novel clustering-based FL (CFL) framework that addresses the four most common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time. To this end, FLUX leverages privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to ensure robust performance and scalability across varying levels and types of distribution shifts. Unlike existing CFL methods addressing non-IID client distribution shifts, FLUX i) does not require any prior knowledge of the types of distribution shifts or the number of client clusters, and ii) supports test-time adaptation, enabling unseen and unlabeled clients to benefit from the most suitable cluster-specific models. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks, two real-world datasets and ten state-of-the-art baselines show that FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 23 percentage points over the best-performing baselines, while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFLUX\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684FLUX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534723\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0eFedAvg\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "FLUX\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

As a result, crafting effective prompts manually remains challenging and time-consuming. Recent automatic prompting methods mitigate this difficulty but face three key limitations: (i) for each new task, they require large datasets to train good prompts;(ii) they rely on costly optimization loops that may take hours; (iii)they typically produce a single task-level prompt that does not adapt to the individual input problem to be solved.\n  We propose GPS, the first general-purpose, per-sample prompting method. Without any task-specific tuning, GPS generates a tailored prompt for each unseen input, improving performance across diverse tasks. The prompter is trained with reinforcement learning on a suite of training tasks and includes a novel regularization for effectively adapting to per-sample prompting. Finally, we employ Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to stabilize inference.\n  Empirically, GPS demonstrates competitive performance: we attain second best results among baselines on text simplification, third best results on summarization and on-par results on classification, while not training on any of these tasks, in contrast to the baselines. For in-domain prompting, we obtain sota on GSM8K.

Here we introduce the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a comprehensive and representative persona prompt collection built from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity.

This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization.

The paper we are referring to is \"Evoking critical thinking abilities in LLMs via reviewer-author prompt editing.\"", "summary": "Lightweight language models remain attractive for on-device and privacy-sensitive applications, but their responses are highly sensitive to prompt quality. For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9).

This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6PI - TTT\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6f6e\u6d41\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6f6e\u6d41\u6b8b\u5dee\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u662f\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f6e\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPI - TTT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u6d41\u6f6e\u6d41\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cPI - TTT\u6bd4\u7eaf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6f6e\u6d41\u6b8b\u5dee\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "PI - TTT\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u662f\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable.

Consequently, the effectiveness of strategies can vary substantially across datasets, models, and even AL cycles. Committing to a single strategy risks suboptimal performance, as no single strategy dominates throughout the entire AL process. We introduce REFINE, an ensemble AL method that combines multiple strategies without knowing in advance which will perform best. In each AL cycle, REFINE operates in two stages: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool by considering an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates capturing different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for. Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show that REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Notably, progressive filtering serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool, which we demonstrate on an audio spectrogram classification use case.

Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders.

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA.

In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training.

This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics.

Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5e7d\u9ed8\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHUMORCHAIN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e7d\u9ed8\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5e7d\u9ed8\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHUMORCHAIN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9274\u522b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7d\u9ed8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHUMORCHAIN\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e7d\u9ed8\u504f\u597d\u3001Elo/BT\u5206\u6570\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u3002"}}

However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on fifteen commonsense and arithmetic benchmarks demonstrate that RoSA outperforms existing mainstream PEFT methods under comparable trainable parameters.

In addition to describing pathological findings in chest X-ray reports, interpreting lines and tubes (L&T) is demanding and repetitive for radiologists, especially with high patient volumes. We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates.

Extensive evaluations on Llama, OPT, and Qwen across diverse benchmarks-covering question answering, commonsense reasoning, and language modeling-demonstrate that R2Q consistently outperforms existing 2-bit quantization methods in both fine-grained and coarse-grained settings.

This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation.

We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks.

However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\\%$ on trustworthiness metrics.

We also present suggestive evidence that scientists' use of these smaller models may be limiting them from getting the full benefits of AI-enabled science, as papers that use larger models appear in higher-impact journals and accrue more citations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2dAI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5e38\u7528\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\u6162\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u9650\u5236\u79d1\u7814\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u5c55\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2dAI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2dAI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u8fd1\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5e38\u7528\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u6bd4\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\u6162\uff0c2013 - 2024\u5e74\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece7.7\u500d\u6269\u5927\u523026\u500d\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u671f\u520a\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u5b50\u9ad8\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5176\u83b7\u5f97AI\u8d4b\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

Most systems use cascaded frameworks that decode phonemes before assembling sentences with an n-gram language model (LM), preventing joint optimization of all stages simultaneously. Here, we introduce an end-to-end Brain-to-Text (BIT) framework that translates neural activity into coherent sentences using a single differentiable neural network. Central to our approach is a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, whose representations transfer to both attempted and imagined speech. In a cascaded setting with an n-gram LM, the pretrained encoder establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Brain-to-Text '24 and '25 benchmarks. Integrated end-to-end with audio large language models (LLMs) and trained with contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment, BIT reduces the word error rate (WER) of the prior end-to-end method from 24.69% to 10.22%. Notably, we find that small-scale audio LLMs markedly improve end-to-end decoding. Beyond record-setting performance, BIT aligns attempted and imagined speech embeddings to enable cross-task generalization.

RSs increasingly incorporate differential privacy (DP) to protect user data, raising questions about how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness. We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous. DPSGD generally reduces the gap between recommendations of popular and less popular items, whereas LDP preserves existing patterns more closely.

In this work, we introduce {\\model}, a modular function-calling LLM pipeline, and present a comprehensive evaluation along three key axes: function calling strategies, retrieval methods, and generative language models. Our framework enables fine-grained analysis by isolating and assessing each component. We benchmark function-calling performance across LLMs, compare our novel structure-aware retrieval method to vector-based and LLM-scoring baselines, and evaluate various LLMs for response synthesis. This modular approach reveals specific failure modes and performance patterns, supporting the development of interpretable and effective educational QA systems.

Most existing approaches to AI-generated text detection rely on fine-tuning large transformer models or building ensembles, which are computationally expensive and often provide limited generalization across domains. Existing lightweight alternatives achieved significantly lower accuracy on large datasets.

In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF). Evaluated and tested on the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus, our models achieve 97% accuracy (~ 0.95 F1) for CNN and 95% accuracy (~ 0.94 F1) for the Random Forest, demonstrating high precision and recall, with ROC-AUC scores of 99.5% and 95%, respectively. The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificing accuracy.This study also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5NEULIF\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f\u4e14\u53ef\u5728CPU\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u4f53\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u6216\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff08RF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCNN\u51c6\u786e\u738797%\uff08F1\u7ea60.95\uff09\uff0cRF\u51c6\u786e\u738795%\uff08F1\u7ea60.94\uff09\uff0cROC - AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a99.5%\u548c95%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f\u4e14\u53ef\u5728CPU\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5728AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing molecular datasets typically provide only basic physicochemical descriptors and therefore cannot support data-driven screening or AI-assisted design of photoinitiators. To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design.

We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible.

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum).

As also demonstrated by several classification experiments, this proposed family of losses is designed to preserve the main advantages observed in the binary setting, such as the direct optimization of the target metric and the robustness to class imbalance, achieving performance comparable to other state-of-the-art loss functions and providing new insights into the interaction between simplex geometry and score-oriented learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u5206\u6570\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u591a\u7c7b\u9762\u5411\u5206\u6570\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u5206\u6570\u7684\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3001\u907f\u514d\u4e8b\u540e\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u5206\u6570\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49MultiSOL\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MultiSOL\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions. Some of the existing sequence decision-making environments, such as TextStarCraftII and LLM-PySC2, are too complicated and require hours of interaction to complete a game. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information. In the experiment, we evaluated the sequential reasoning ability, decision-making performance and computational efficiency of mainstream large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLabel Disguise Defense (LDD)\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u90e8\u5206\u653b\u51fb\u9020\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u522b\u540d\u6807\u7b7e\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u6613\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LDD\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u522b\u540d\u6807\u7b7e\u9690\u85cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6807\u7b7e\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "LDD\u6062\u590d\u653b\u51fb\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u80fd\u529b\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u522b\u540d\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u6bd4\u65e0\u9632\u5fa1\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u522b\u540d\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u522b\u540d\u6807\u7b7e\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u5c42\uff0c\u62b5\u5fa1\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Existing principled fine-tuning methods aim to maximize the expected reward of generated samples, while retaining knowledge from the pre-trained model via KL-divergence regularization. In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows.

Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u707e\u5bb3\u76f8\u5173\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6743\u5a01\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u707e\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u53ef\u4f5c\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u533a\u5206\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u975e\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u707e\u5bb3\u76f8\u5173\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u53d6F1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.69\uff0c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u70b9\u63d0\u53d6F1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.74\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4e3a\u54cd\u5e94\u8005\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3001\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u707e\u540e\u6062\u590d\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design. The results support the practicality of the approach for use with various dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0Koopman\u672c\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bfb\u627e\u65e0\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0Koopman\u672c\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u786e\u5b9aKoopman\u6a21\u5f0f\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u5230\u65b0\u57fa\uff0c\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u62df\u5408\u83b7\u53d6\u672c\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u521d\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0eKoopman\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0Koopman\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u4e3b\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u6570\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

This study examines the complex intersection of AI and science, with a specific focus on the challenges posed to copyright law and the principles of open science. The author argues that current regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions like the United States, China, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, while aiming to foster innovation, contain significant gaps, particularly concerning the use of copyrighted works and open science outputs for AI training. Widely adopted licensing mechanisms, such as Creative Commons, fail to adequately address the nuances of AI training, and the pervasive lack of attribution within AI systems fundamentally challenges established notions of originality. This paper issues a call to action, contending that AI training should not be shielded under fair use exceptions. Instead, the author advocates for upholding authors' rights to refuse the use of their works for AI training and proposes that universities assume a leading role in shaping responsible AI governance. The conclusion is that a harmonized international legislative effort is urgently needed to ensure transparency, protect intellectual property, and prevent the emergence of an oligopolistic market structure that could prioritize commercial profit over scientific integrity and equitable knowledge production.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76GenAI\u548cLLMs\u878d\u5165\u79d1\u7814\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6559\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7248\u6743\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u56fd\u9645\u7acb\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8GenAI\u548cLLMs\u878d\u5165\u79d1\u7814\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6559\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u3001\u6b27\u76df\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53f8\u6cd5\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5728AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u7248\u6743\u4f5c\u54c1\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u4ea7\u51fa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u8bb8\u53ef\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec6\u8282\uff0cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f52\u56e0\u6311\u6218\u539f\u521b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u56fd\u9645\u7acb\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5784\u65ad\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

However, current alignment techniques rely on generic definitions of harm that fail to capture context-dependent violations, such as administrative fraud and clinical discrimination. To address this, we introduce Medical Malice: a dataset of 214,219 adversarial prompts calibrated to the regulatory and ethical complexities of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Crucially, the dataset includes the reasoning behind each violation, enabling models to internalize ethical boundaries rather than merely memorizing a fixed set of refusals. Using an unaligned agent (Grok-4) within a persona-driven pipeline, we synthesized high-fidelity threats across seven taxonomies, ranging from procurement manipulation and queue-jumping to obstetric violence. We discuss the ethical design of releasing these \"vulnerability signatures\" to correct the information asymmetry between malicious actors and AI developers. Ultimately, this work advocates for a shift from universal to context-aware safety, providing the necessary resources to immunize healthcare AI against the nuanced, systemic threats inherent to high-stakes medical environments -- vulnerabilities that represent the paramount risk to patient safety and the successful integration of AI in healthcare systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u5df4\u897f\u7edf\u4e00\u536b\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6076\u610f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ec6\u5fae\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u884c\u653f\u6b3a\u8bc8\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b214,219\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6076\u610f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff08Grok - 4\uff09\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u4e03\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u8fdd\u89c4\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u548cAI\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods mainly use first-order similarity graphs to preserve local structure, often overlooking the global structure that can be captured by second-order similarity. In addition, a few MUFS methods leverage predefined second-order similarity graphs, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers and resulting in suboptimal feature selection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection. Comprehensive experimental results on real multi-view datasets show that SHINE-FS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5SHINE - FS\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u8bc6\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u56fe\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u951a\u70b9 - \u6837\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSHINE - FS\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SHINE - FS\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u9636\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although traditional web and mobile policies are well studied, the privacy policies of LLM providers, their LLM-specific content, and their evolution over time remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal empirical study of privacy policies for mainstream LLM providers worldwide. We curate a chronological dataset of 74 historical privacy policies and 115 supplemental privacy documents from 11 LLM providers across 5 countries up to August 2025, and extract over 3,000 sentence-level edits between consecutive policy versions. We compare LLM privacy policies to those of other software formats, propose a taxonomy tailored to LLM privacy policies, annotate policy edits and align them with a timeline of key LLM ecosystem events. Results show they are substantially longer, demand college-level reading ability, and remain highly vague. Our taxonomy analysis reveals patterns in how providers disclose LLM-specific practices and highlights regional disparities in coverage.

But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them.

Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fafMRI - LM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5fMRI\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8fde\u63a5\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u3001\u9002\u914d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u8303\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "fMRI - LM\u5728\u5404\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "fMRI - LM\u4e3afMRI\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6846\u67b6LAYER\u5206\u67903D\u8d85\u58f0\u516d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u5bf9\u808c\u7b4b\u819c\u75bc\u75db\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u975e\u808c\u8089\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u808c\u7b4b\u819c\u75bc\u75db\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u9762\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0d\u660e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u808c\u8089\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u4ed6\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6846\u67b6LAYER\uff0c\u5206\u67903D\u8d85\u58f0\u516d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5bf9\u808c\u7b4b\u819c\u75bc\u75db\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u7528\u8d854000\u6b21\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b3D\u8d85\u58f0\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u808c\u8089\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u75bc\u75db\u9884\u6d4b\u8d21\u732e\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LAYER\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9a\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u89e3\u5256\u4e0e\u75bc\u75db\u751f\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9776\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f71\u50cf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

With class-specific $K_n$ heads, GAF supports a rich family of directed transport maps between a shared base distribution and multiple modalities, enabling controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic. We achieve strong sample quality (FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ $64\\times 64$) while uniquely providing compositional generation as an architectural primitive.

The design of complex three-dimensional RNA architectures remains computationally demanding and mostly unresolved, as most existing approaches focus on secondary structures. In order to address tertiary RNA inverse folding, we present BeeRNA, a bio-inspired method that employs the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm. Our approach combines base-pair distance filtering with RMSD-based structural assessment using RhoFold for structure prediction, resulting in a two-stage fitness evaluation strategy. To guarantee biologically plausible sequences with balanced GC content, the algorithm takes thermodynamic constraints and adaptive mutation rates into consideration. In this work, we focus primarily on short and medium-length RNAs ($<$ 100 nucleotides), a biologically significant regime that includes microRNAs (miRNAs), aptamers, and ribozymes, where BeeRNA achieves high structural fidelity with practical CPU runtimes.

Support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using transcriptome-only, proteome-only, and combined transcriptome-proteome feature sets.

Correlation analyses evaluated concordance between RNA and protein expression and the relationships of selected biomarkers with SF2.

Using the lens of function substitution in the Viable Systems Model, we present an experimental methodology using ChatGPT to score and rank business and management papers from REF 2021 submissions, \"reverse engineering\" the assessment by comparing AI-generated scores with known institutional results. Through rigourous testing of 822 papers across 11 institutions, we established scoring boundaries that aligned with reported REF outcomes: 49% between 1* and 2*, 59% between 2* and 3*, and 69% between 3* and 4*.

At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs. Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval, VeriDispatcher achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls, and on VerilogEval maintains accuracy while reducing commercial usage by 25%, enabling cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVeriDispatcher\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591aLLM RTL\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347RTL\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVeriDispatcher\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5c06RTL\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u5408\u9002\u7684LLM\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7d27\u51d1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8def\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728RTLLM\u4e0a\u752840%\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u7528\u5b9e\u73b018%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728VerilogEval\u4e0a\u7ef4\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1125%\u5546\u4e1a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "VeriDispatcher\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Our approach centers on Differentiable Finite-State Transducers (DFSTs), a Turing-complete model family that avoids the pitfalls of prior architectures by enabling constant-precision, constant-time generation, and end-to-end log-parallel differentiable training. Leveraging policy-trajectory observations from expert agents, we train DFSTs to perform binary and decimal addition and multiplication. Remarkably, models trained on tiny datasets generalize without error to inputs thousands of times longer than the training examples.

The central limitation of current risk analysis is the inability to populate the $\\textit{catastrophic event space}$, or the set of potential large-scale harms to which probabilities might be assigned. This intractability is worsened by the $\\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios (\"qualitative\" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic L\u00e9vy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating \"thick\" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail.

Rappaport"], "title": "GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Channel state information (CSI) is essential for adaptive beamforming and maintaining robust links in wireless communication systems. However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165FLAWS\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u5173\u952e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGPT 5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u4ea7\u51fa\u589e\u957f\u4f7f\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f46\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u80fd\u529b\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d2\u5165\u4f7f\u8bba\u70b9\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGPT 5\u5728k=10\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe39.1%\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FLAWS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u5173\u952e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation.

While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLILAD\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u96be\u517c\u987e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLILAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548cLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u8870\u51cf\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLILAD\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "LILAD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e5f\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable.

Data augmentation has proven to be an effective strategy to address this limitation by increasing dataset diversity and improving model generalization without requiring additional field data. However, most augmentation techniques used to date rely on effective but relatively simple transformations, leaving open the question of whether deep generative models can provide additional benefits. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep generative for data augmentation in marine mammal call detection including: Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Using Southern Resident Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from two long-term hydrophone deployments in the Salish Sea, we compare these approaches against traditional augmentation methods such as time-shifting and vocalization masking. While all generative approaches improved classification performance relative to the baseline, diffusion-based augmentation yielded the highest recall (0.87) and overall F1-score (0.75). A hybrid strategy combining generative-based synthesis with traditional methods achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.81.

This paper presents a thorough empirical study of Mamba-1 and Mamba-2, systematically profiled for performance to assess the design principles that contribute to their efficiency in state-space modeling. A detailed analysis of computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties was performed for sequence lengths ranging from 64 to 16384 tokens.

This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTARFVAE\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41TARFLOW\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668VAE\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0TARFLOW\u6a21\u5757\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528TARFLOW\u524d\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "TARFVAE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "TARFVAE\u662f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time.

Code available at https://github.com/finnvamosi/CRAwDAD", "summary": "When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing \"what if\" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents.

However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment.

Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed \"PathReasoning\", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements.

This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u884c\u4eba\u6df7\u4e71\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df7\u6c8c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ecfPCA\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0cCatBoost\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u57ce\u5e02\u63d0\u5347\u6b65\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bb0\u5f55\u663c\u591c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u56db\u4e2a\u6df7\u6c8c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528PCA\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6df7\u6c8c\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u8bad\u7ec3\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cCatBoost\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "CatBoost\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u767d\u5929PCA - \u57faCatBoost\u6a21\u578bR\u00b2\u8fbe0.8319\uff0c\u591c\u95f4\u8fbe0.8574\uff0cSHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or \"experts\". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential \"plan--act--observe\" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family.

The focus is on developing online attack predictors that detect attacks in real time and identify the current stage of the attack. While such predictors have been proposed in the recent literature, these works typically rely on constructing a monolithic predictor tailored to a specific attack type and scenario. Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them.

Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings.

This method allows for recursive modeling of wave excitation as a time-varying input, relaxing prior works' assumption of a constant input. We derive statistically consistent process noise covariance and implement a square root cubature Kalman filter for sensor data fusion. Further, we derive the Posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound to evaluate estimator performance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and data from a high-fidelity validated simulator confirm that the estimated wave spectrum matches methods assuming complete transfer function knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d77\u51b5\u548c\u8239\u8236\u53c2\u6570\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6ce2\u6d6a - \u8239\u8236\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u53ef\u53d8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u4f2a\u8d28\u91cf - \u5f39\u7c27 - \u963b\u5c3c\u5668\u5bf9\u6ce2\u6d6a - \u8239\u8236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce2\u6d6a\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u7528\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u5bb9\u79ef\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u878d\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u540e\u9a8c\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e - \u7f57\u4e0b\u754c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6ce2\u6d6a\u8c31\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d77\u51b5\u548c\u8239\u8236\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

A Systematic Evaluation Across Retinal Imaging Tasks", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5426\u5408\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u6210\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u768412 - 13\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u666e\u904d\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u67b6\u6784\u5360\u4f18\uff0cRETFound\u4ec5\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7ea7\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6210\u672c\u5408\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u51d1\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u3002"}}

Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model.

To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations.

While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse.

We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures.

This work investigates the distillability of an LLM's core security logic. We propose a novel framework that incorporates an improved outline filling attack to achieve dense sampling of the model's security boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking regression paradigm that replaces standard regression and trains the proxy model to predict which prompt yields a higher ASR. Experimental results show that our proxy model achieves an accuracy of 91.1 percent in predicting the relative ranking of average long response (ALR), and 69.2 percent in predicting ASR. These findings confirm the predictability and distillability of jailbreak behaviors, and demonstrate the potential of leveraging such distillability to optimize black-box attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ed1\u76d2\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u7a84\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6392\u540d\u56de\u5f52\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8d8a\u72f1\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ed1\u76d2\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u7a84\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLM\u6838\u5fc3\u5b89\u5168\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u7eb2\u586b\u5145\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u540d\u56de\u5f52\u8303\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u56de\u5f52\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u5747\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u540d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91.1%\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe69.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8d8a\u72f1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u84b8\u998f\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications.

We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets).

However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction.

Accepted to Learning on Graphs Conference 2025", "summary": "We revisit the theoretical performances of Spectral Clustering, a classical algorithm for graph partitioning that relies on the eigenvectors of a matrix representation of the graph. Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian.

Watson Research Center, New York, USA, 2024", "summary": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner.

Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement.

While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM \"event interpreter\" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024).

These differences can create instability during training, slow convergence, and reduce overall model performance.

Existing text detectors typically rely on a single methodological paradigm and suffer from poor generalization and high false positive rates (FPR), especially on high-stakes academic text. We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction. Evaluated on a large-scale, multigenerator corpus of 30,000 documents, our system achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, with a 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text.

This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning.

The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU.

Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data.

However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e1c\u4e9aCMAQ - OBS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5f15\u5165GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8ePM\u6d53\u5ea6\u573a\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684PM\u6d53\u5ea6\u573a\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e1c\u4e9a\u7b49\u5730\u533a\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u4e14\u6807\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e1c\u4e9aCMAQ - OBS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u7c7b\u522b\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u56de\u6eda\u7684Group - Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "CMAQ - OBS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51cf\u5c11\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5dee59.5%\uff0cGRPO\u6846\u67b6\u8f83\u4ec5SFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u738747.3%\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Existing efficiency approaches typically focus on model-centric interventions, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, to reduce verbosity. In contrast, we propose a training-free, input-centric approach. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT.

We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acbQ\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e09\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u534f\u8c03\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u4ea4\u4e92\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u523b\u753b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3001\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acbQ\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u6b65\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53cc\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u810a\u5bf9\u5e94\u6838\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6301\u7eed\u5408\u4f5c\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u6838\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5448\u73b0\u7531\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6838\u6f02\u79fb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u76f8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u4ea4\u4e92\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Although some neural-network-based solutions predict layout-level performance directly from netlists, they often face generalization challenges due to the black-box heuristics of commercial placement-and-routing tools, which create disparate data across designs. To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions. Next, we rely on EDA tools for timing analysis, offloading the long-path numerical reasoning. Finally, ParaGate performs global calibration using subgraph features. Experiments show that ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data: on openE906, its arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897.

MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states.

In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds.

To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faARPGNet\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u60c5\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u90e8\u5916\u89c2\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u533a\u57df\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u5f81\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8868\u5f81\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u884c\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cARPGNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ARPGNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Using hardware-in-the-loop architecture search under edge latency and memory constraints, we obtain a compact hybrid backbone that combines gated short convolutions with a small number of grouped query attention blocks, delivering up to 2x faster prefill and decode on CPUs compared to similarly sized models. The LFM2 family covers 350M-8.3B parameters, including dense models (350M, 700M, 1.2B, 2.6B) and a mixture-of-experts variant (8.3B total, 1.5B active), all with 32K context length. LFM2's training pipeline includes a tempered, decoupled Top-K knowledge distillation objective that avoids support mismatch; curriculum learning with difficulty-ordered data; and a three-stage post-training recipe of supervised fine-tuning, length-normalized preference optimization, and model merging. Pre-trained on 10-12T tokens, LFM2 models achieve strong results across diverse benchmarks; for example, LFM2-2.6B reaches 79.56% on IFEval and 82.41% on GSM8K. We further build multimodal and retrieval variants: LFM2-VL for vision-language tasks, LFM2-Audio for speech, and LFM2-ColBERT for retrieval. LFM2-VL supports tunable accuracy-latency tradeoffs via token-efficient visual processing, while LFM2-Audio separates audio input and output pathways to enable real-time speech-to-speech interaction competitive with models 3x larger. LFM2-ColBERT provides a low-latency encoder for queries and documents, enabling high-performance retrieval across multiple languages.

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset.

Amino acid mutations in protein-nucleic acid complexes often lead to vital diseases. Experimental techniques have their own specific limitations in predicting mutational effects in protein-nucleic acid complexes. In this study, we compiled a large dataset of 1951 mutations including both protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes and integrated structural and sequential features to build a deep learning-based regression model named DeepPNI. This model estimates mutation-induced binding free energy changes in protein-nucleic acid complexes. The structural features are encoded via edge-aware RGCN and the sequential features are extracted using protein language model ESM-2. We have achieved a high average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.76 in the large dataset via five-fold cross-validation.

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6ASTRO\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e14\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u518d\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6eda\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u63a5\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "ASTRO\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728OGBench\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "ASTRO\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We propose the Histogram AutoEncoder (HistoAE), an unsupervised representation learning network featuring a custom histogram-based loss that enforces a physically structured latent space. Applied to silicon microstrip detectors, HistoAE learns an interpretable two-dimensional latent space corresponding to the particle's charge and impact position. After simple post-processing, it achieves a charge resolution of $0.25\\,e$ and a position resolution of $3\\,\u03bc\\mathrm{m}$ on beam-test data, comparable to the conventional approach.

However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks.

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions.

LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u67e5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u4f46\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u5168\u9762\u68c0\u67e5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u5bb3\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528StereoSet\u548cCrowSPairs\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ba1\u9f50\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1bLLMs\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models. While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. This challenge not only pertains to standard XAI techniques but also to human examination and conversational XAI approaches that need access to model internals to interpret them correctly and completely. To this end, we propose conceptually representing such interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks. These include the AI models themselves, as well as control mechanisms grounded in literature. The structural building blocks can then be explained through complementary explanatory building blocks, such as established XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP. The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an unambiguous overview of the underlying system, serving as a communication basis for both human and automated agents, thus aligning human and machine interpretability of the embedded AI models.

To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth. Last but not least, we adopt the low-degree Legendre polynomial to approximate the nonlinear smooth activation function SiLU under the guarantee of tiny accuracy error before and after encrypted inference.

Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations.

Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain.

It can be interpreted as a bound on adversary's capability to distinguish two adjacent datasets according to chosen adjacency relation. In practice, most DP implementations use the add/remove adjacency relation, where two datasets are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single record, thereby protecting membership. In many ML applications, however, the goal is to protect attributes of individual records (e.g., labels used in supervised fine-tuning). We show that privacy accounting under add/remove overstates attribute privacy compared to accounting under the substitute adjacency relation, which permits substituting one record. To demonstrate this gap, we develop novel attacks to audit DP under substitute adjacency, and show empirically that audit results are inconsistent with DP guarantees reported under add/remove, yet remain consistent with the budget accounted under the substitute adjacency relation.

Our studies, using two Brazilian Indigenous languages, related but with significant structural linguistic characteristics, indicated none or very limited influence from those training factors, suggesting differences between languages may play a significant role in the ability to produce translators by fine-tuning pre-trained models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u8d85\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6e05\u6d17\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9650\u5236\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e24\u79cd\u5df4\u897f\u571f\u8457\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\u6216\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become mainstream for social bot detection due to their ability to integrate structural and attribute features, with spectral-based approaches demonstrating particular efficacy due to discriminative patterns in the spectral domain. However, current spectral GNN methods face two limitations: (1) their broad-spectrum fitting mechanisms degrade the focus on bot-specific spectral features, and (2) certain domain knowledge valuable for bot detection, e.g., low homophily correlates with high-frequency features, has not been fully incorporated into existing methods.\n  To address these challenges, we propose HW-GNN, a novel homophily-aware graph spectral network with Gaussian window constraints. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a Gaussian-window constrained spectral network that employs learnable Gaussian windows to highlight bot-related spectral features, and (ii) a homophily-aware adaptation mechanism that injects domain knowledge between homophily ratios and frequency features into the Gaussian window optimization process.

However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

In this work, we develop a unified framework to derive explicit formulas for both first- and second-order tangent sets to various low-rank sets, including low-rank matrices, tensors, symmetric matrices, and positive semidefinite matrices. The framework also accommodates the intersection of a low-rank set and another set satisfying mild assumptions, thereby yielding a tangent intersection rule. Through the lens of tangent sets, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a nonsmooth problem and its smooth parameterization share equivalent second-order stationary points. Moreover, we exploit tangent sets to characterize optimality conditions for low-rank optimization and prove that verifying second-order optimality is NP-hard. In a separate line of analysis, we investigate variational geometry of the graph of the normal cone to matrix varieties, deriving the explicit Bouligand tangent cone, Fr\u00e9chet and Mordukhovich normal cones to the graph.

Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08QGC\uff09\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7840\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5QGC\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6548\u5e94\u57fa\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6548\u5e94\u57fa\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5QGC\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793aQGC\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u6a21\u7cca\u5206\u7ea7\u96b6\u5c5e\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u503c\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas.

When fusing multiple diarization systems, DOVER-Lap remains the only established approach, operating at the segment level with hard decisions. We propose working with continuous probability outputs, which enables more sophisticated calibration and fusion techniques that can leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing EEND models at the probability level. We investigate two output formulations (multilabel and powerset representations) and their impact on calibration and fusion effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark, we demonstrate that proper calibration provides substantial improvements even for individual models (up to 19% relative DER reduction), in some cases mitigating the absence of domain adaptation. We reveal that joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration, and that the Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms calibrating individual models before fusion while requiring calibration of only a single combined model. Our best configuration outperforms DOVER-Lap in terms of DER while providing reliable confidence estimates essential for downstream applications.

Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start.

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets.

ResearchArcade also preserves temporal evolution at both the manuscript and community levels, supporting the study of paper revisions as well as broader research trends over time. Additionally, ResearchArcade unifies diverse academic task definitions and supports various models with distinct input requirements.

Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408RNC\u635f\u5931\u57fa\u4e8eT1w\u7ed3\u6784MRI\u4f30\u8ba1\u8111\u9f84\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Grad - RAM\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u4e14\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408Rank - N - Contrast (RNC)\u635f\u5931\u57fa\u4e8eT1w\u7ed3\u6784MRI\u4f30\u8ba1\u8111\u9f84\uff0c\u5229\u7528Grad - RAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u56de\u5f52\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMAE\u4e3a4.27\u5e74\uff0c$R^2$\u4e3a0.93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff1bGrad - RAM\u663e\u793aRNC\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u7269\u8111\u9f84\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8111\u9f84\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6709\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data.

Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u865a\u62df\u58a8\u6c34\u7f51\u7edc\uff08VIN\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u624b\u672f\u5207\u9762\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u58a8\u6c34\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5207\u9664\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u7269\u7406\u58a8\u6c34\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u7535\u707c\u4f2a\u5f71\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u7247\u8fb9\u7f18\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "VIN\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u5c42\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528120\u5f20\u4eba\u6241\u6843\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7H&E\u67d3\u8272\u5207\u7247\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e2dVIN\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u5b9a\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea673.3%\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u5207\u7247\u8fb9\u7f18\u56fe\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VIN\u53ef\u6355\u6349\u7535\u707c\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u65e0\u58a8\u6c34\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u63cf\u7ed8\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7eb3\u5165\u5e38\u89c4\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency.

In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities.

Therefore, it is imperative to research the classification of the newly registered Pornographic and Gambling Domain Names (PGDN). However, scholarly investigation into this topic is limited. Previous efforts in PGDN classification pursue high accuracy using ideal sample data, while others employ up-to-date data from real-world scenarios but achieve lower classification accuracy. This paper introduces the Real-PGDN method, which accomplishes a complete process of timely and comprehensive real-data crawling, feature extraction with feature-missing tolerance, precise PGDN classification, and assessment of application effects in actual scenarios. Our two-level classifier, which integrates CoSENT (BERT-based), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and traditional classification algorithms, achieves a 97.88% precision. The research process amasses the NRD2024 dataset, which contains continuous detection information over 20 days for 1,500,000 newly registered domain names across 6 directions.

Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence.

However, this progress comes at a considerable cost to the environment as training and deploying these models consume significant computational resources and energy and are responsible for large carbon footprints in the atmosphere. In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work. This work not only provides actionable insights to mitigate the environmental impact of AI but also poses new research questions for the community to explore.

In a preregistered randomized controlled experiment, participants (N = 2,004) viewed mock search result pages varying in the presence (vs. absence), placement (top vs. middle), and stance (benefit-framed vs. harm-framed) of AI-generated summaries across four publicly debated topics. Compared to a no-summary control group, participants exposed to AI-generated summaries reported issue attitudes, behavioral intentions, and policy support that aligned more closely with the AI summary stance.

However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers.

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning.

To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCORTEX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f46\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORTEX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u56fe\u50cf - \u6587\u672c\u53cc\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6355\u6349\u4ec5\u9760\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data. For the 2D OPG track, the top method improved the Instance Affinity (IA) score by over 44 percentage points. For the 3D CBCT track, the winning approach boosted the Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points. This challenge confirms the substantial benefit of SSL for complex, instance-level medical image segmentation tasks where labeled data is scarce. The most effective approaches consistently leveraged hybrid semi-supervised frameworks that combined knowledge from foundational models like SAM with multi-stage, coarse-to-fine refinement pipelines.

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models.

While recent advances have improved low-level humanoid locomotion and robot manipulation, language-conditioned whole-body control remains a significant challenge.

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability.

In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks.

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning.

This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency.

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u5bf9\u513f\u79d1\u624b\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u9aa8\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fee\u590d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66AI\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u4fee\u590d\u513f\u79d1\u624b\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u975e\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u8bb0\u533a\u57df\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u9aa8\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528RSNA\u9aa8\u9f84\u6311\u6218\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9009200\u5f20\u539f\u59cbX\u5149\u7247\uff0c\u7528gpt - image - 1\u751f\u6210600\u5f20\u4fee\u590d\u7248\u672c\uff1b\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5MAE\u548cAUC\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u590d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9aa8\u9f84MAE\u4ece6.26\u589e\u81f330.11\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7bAUC\u4ece0.955\u964d\u81f30.704\uff1b\u4fee\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u867d\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u96c6\u6210\u6b64\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u524d\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

While the potential benefits of swarm-based UAV networks are growing significantly, they are vulnerable to various security attacks that can jeopardize the overall mission success by degrading their performance, disrupting decision-making, and compromising the trajectory planning process. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a vital role in identifying potential security attacks to ensure the secure operation of UAV swarm networks. However, conventional IDS primarily focuses on binary classification with resource-intensive neural networks and faces challenges, including latency, privacy breaches, increased performance overhead, and model drift.

This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages.

This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCogIP - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u56fe\u50cf\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u53d7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CogIP - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u5fae\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u521b\u610f\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7c7b\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u5f00\u542f\u66f4\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u3002"}}

A Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Counterfactual Expected Goals", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.AI", "stat.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "This study develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework that integrates expert domain knowledge to quantify player-specific effects in expected goals (xG) estimation, addressing a limitation of standard models that treat all players as identical finishers. Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG).

To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting.

Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence.

While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D C\u00f3rdoba-C\u00f3rdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u662f\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5c06PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u820d\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u5982IPM\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7b2c4\u4e2a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b64\u5b50\u65cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6570\u503c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

Five models -- including GPT-4 and lightweight open-source alternatives -- are tested across three heterogeneous datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) and two prompting strategies (minimal vs. enriched with linguistic and psychological cues). Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance, but also introduce a systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies substantially: Openness and Agreeableness are relatively easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value.

Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory.

Workshop: LAW 2025: Bridging Language, Agent, and World Models", "summary": "To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying \"what to do\". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5 LED - WM \u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u6e38\u620f\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa LED - WM \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MESSENGER \u548c MESSENGER - WM \u4e24\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cLED - WM \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "conclusion": "LED - WM \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence.

This architecture inherently mitigates scattering interference between the object and the detector but sensitive to scattering between the light source and the object. To address this challenge, we propose an optical diffraction neural networks (ODNNs) assisted ghost imaging method for imaging through dynamic scattering media. In our scheme, a set of fixed ODNNs, trained on simulated datasets, is incorporated into the experimental optical path to actively correct random distortions induced by dynamic scattering media.

Proactive detection of cyber threats has become essential to help security teams identify potential risks and implement effective mitigation measures. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) plays a key role by providing security analysts with evidence-based knowledge about cyber threats. CTI information can be extracted using various techniques and data sources; however, machine learning has proven promising. As for data sources, social networks and online discussion forums are commonly explored. In this study, we apply text mining techniques and machine learning to data collected from Dark Web forums in Brazilian Portuguese to identify malicious posts. Our contributions include the creation of three original datasets, a novel multi-stage labeling process combining indicators of compromise (IoCs), contextual keywords, and manual analysis, and a comprehensive evaluation of text representations and classifiers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus specifically on Brazilian Portuguese content in this domain.

Prior methods relying on marker-based prediction struggle with modeling the intricate relationships among elements and experience sharp performance declines when predicting higher-order elements (e.g., c and s) under standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence. Specifically, we generate element-wise confusable candidates via syntactic and semantic proximity, then train the model with listwise objectives to prefer the gold candidates over closely competing alternatives.

We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object.

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network.

Conference proceedings pending to be published", "summary": "Voltage overscaling, or undervolting, is an enticing approximate technique in the context of energy-efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) acceleration, given the quadratic relationship between power and voltage. Nevertheless, its very high error rate has thwarted its general adoption. Moreover, recent undervolting accelerators rely on 8-bit arithmetic and cannot compete with state-of-the-art low-precision (<8b) architectures. To overcome these issues, we propose a new technique called Guarded Aggressive underVolting (GAV), which combines the ideas of undervolting and bit-serial computation to create a flexible approximation method based on aggressively lowering the supply voltage on a select number of least significant bit combinations. Based on this idea, we implement GAVINA (GAV mIxed-precisioN Accelerator), a novel architecture that supports arbitrary mixed precision and flexible undervolting, with an energy efficiency of up to 89 TOP/sW in its most aggressive configuration. By developing an error model of GAVINA, we show that GAV can achieve an energy efficiency boost of 20% via undervolting, with negligible accuracy degradation on ResNet-18.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGAV\u6280\u672f\u548cGAVINA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u538b\u8fc7\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6b20\u538b\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGAV\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b20\u538b\u548c\u4f4d\u4e32\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u90e8\u5206\u6700\u4f4e\u6709\u6548\u4f4d\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7535\u6e90\u7535\u538b\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0GAVINA\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "GAVINA\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6700\u6fc0\u8fdb\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u6548\u8fbe89 TOP/sW\uff0cGAV\u901a\u8fc7\u6b20\u538b\u4f7f\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u534720%\uff0cResNet - 18\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "GAV\u6280\u672f\u548cGAVINA\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead.

Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund).

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A", "summary": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528ESR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea6\u675f\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0cESR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7269\u7406\u548c\u91cd\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea6\u675f\u6655\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u8d85\u989d\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "5%\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\uff0c20\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6837\u672cESR\u80fd\u6062\u590dNFW\u5256\u9762\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u8c03\u67e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u53d7\u9752\u7750\uff0c\u4f46NFW\u4ecd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ESR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u771f\u6b63\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6655\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5f20\u5730\u9762RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u7b97\u68ee\u6797\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\uff08AGB\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u7b97AGB\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u78b3\u50a8\u91cf\u548c\u91ce\u706b\u71c3\u6599\u8d1f\u8377\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06AGB\u4f30\u7b97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165AGB\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u62103D SPREAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u901f\u751f\u957f\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97AGB\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bAGB\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684SPREAD\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cAGB\u4f30\u7b97\u4e2d\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.22 kg/m\u00b2\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e3a1.94 kg/m\u00b2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5355\u5f20RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u7b97AGB\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u5021\u8bae\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002"}}

This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payload sizes, and per-client costs rendering them impractical for many edge deployments.\n  In this work, we present Hyb-Agg, a lightweight and communication-efficient secure aggregation protocol that integrates Multi-Key CKKS (MK-CKKS) homomorphic encryption with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)-based additive masking. Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients.\n  We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size. By directly addressing the communication bottleneck, Hyb-Agg enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning that is practical for real-world IoT deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8baeHyb - Agg\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u96c6\u4e2d\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Multi - Key CKKS\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eECDH\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u63a9\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21\u975e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e9a\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u5b50\u7ea6\u4e3a\u660e\u6587\u768412\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Hyb - Agg\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters.

We synthesised the results by summarising discrimination and calibration performance statistics and evaluated study quality by examining risk of bias and clinical utility.\n  Results We identified 38 studies reporting the development and validation of 40 models. Most studies reported Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the discrimination statistic with a range of 0.68-0.99. Only eight studies reported calibration performance, and three studies reported external validation. 31 studies had a high risk of bias, mainly in the analysis domain, and three studies had low risk of bias. The overall clinical utility of violence prediction models is poor, as indicated by risks of overfitting due to small samples, lack of transparent reporting, and low generalisability.\n  Conclusion Although black box machine learning models currently have limited applicability in clinical settings, they may show promise for identifying high-risk individuals. We recommend five key considerations for violence prediction modelling: (i) ensuring methodological quality (e.g. following guidelines) and interdisciplinary collaborations; (ii) using black box algorithms only for highly complex data; (iii) incorporating dynamic predictions to allow for risk monitoring; (iv) developing more trustworthy algorithms using explainable methods; and (v) applying causal machine learning approaches where appropriate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u66b4\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4f46\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5efa\u6a21\u4e94\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u66b4\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u4e5d\u4e2a\u4e66\u76ee\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5b66\u672f\u81f32025\u5e749\u6708\u5173\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u66b4\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u5224\u522b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a38\u9879\u62a5\u544a40\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u62a5\u544aAUC\u8303\u56f40.68 - 0.99\uff0c\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u62a5\u544a\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c31\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9ad8\u504f\u501a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u66b4\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u66b4\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e94\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs.

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUSArt\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u6821\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUSArt\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u91c7\u6837\u76842D\u8111\u89e3\u5256\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b05\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "USArt\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits.

Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm.

While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset.

Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

However, developing AI-driven chatbots for this purpose requires large, high-quality question-and-answer (Q&A) datasets, which are typically expensive and resource-intensive to produce, especially for low-resource languages like Persian. In this paper, we introduce MegaChat, the first fully synthetic Persian Q&A dataset designed to evaluate intelligent sales chatbots in Telegram-based e-commerce. We propose a novel, automated multi-agent architecture that generates persona-aware Q&A pairs by collecting data from active Telegram shopping channels. The system employs specialized agents for question generation, validation, and refinement, ensuring the production of realistic and diverse conversational data. To evaluate answer generation, we compare three classic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models with our advanced agentic system, which features multi-query retrieval, reranking, and persona-aligned response synthesis. Using GPT-5.1 for evaluation across six quality dimensions, our results show that the agentic architecture outperformed traditional RAG models in 4 out of 5 diverse channels, demonstrating its ability to generate scalable, high-quality datasets without relying on expensive human annotation or complex fine-tuning. MegaChat provides SMEs with an efficient, cost-effective solution for building intelligent customer engagement systems in specialized commercial domains, enabling advancements in multilingual conversational AI for low-resource languages.
