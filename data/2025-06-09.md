### [1] [A Path to Loving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05352)
*John Beverley,Regina Hurley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文为爱情的本体论表征奠定基础，区分爱情不同含义，解决相关质疑，为跨学科应用奠基。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决爱情的哲学复杂性和科学相关性问题，强调其对AI应用的提升作用。

Method: 借鉴基础形式本体（BFO）和其他应用本体方法区分爱情的不同含义，提出因果关联模型解决质疑。

Result: 给出了精确且可扩展的本体论解释，明确爱情是被动感觉和主动评价判断的串联。

Conclusion: 为未来跨学科应用奠定基础，使爱情成为本体工程、人工智能和科学的正式研究对象。

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

### [2] [Contextual Memory Intelligence -- A Foundational Paradigm for Human-AI Collaboration and Reflective Generative AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05370)
*Kristy Wedel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出上下文记忆智能（CMI）作为构建智能系统的新范式，介绍洞察层实现该愿景，解决当前AI架构盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI系统在组织环境应用中存在记忆局限，导致重复错误和缺乏清晰度，需新范式解决问题。

Method: 借鉴认知科学、组织理论、人机交互和AI治理，形式化上下文的捕获、推理和再生；提出洞察层模块化架构，利用人在环反思等将上下文记忆融入系统。

Result: CMI使系统能结合数据、历史、判断和变化的上下文进行推理。

Conclusion: CMI为创建有效、可反思、可审计和对社会负责的智能系统提供框架，增强人机协作等。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

### [3] [Constructive Symbolic Reinforcement Learning via Intuitionistic Logic and Goal-Chaining Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05422)
*Andrei T. Patrascu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于构造性逻辑推理的学习与规划框架，替代传统基于奖励的优化方法，在网格世界实验中表现良好，为强化学习提供新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖奖励优化，存在探索成本高、有不安全或无效过渡的问题，需新方法保证逻辑有效性和安全性。

Method: 将动作、过渡和目标表示为逻辑命题，在直觉主义逻辑下构建构造性证明，通过目标链、条件跟踪和知识积累制定计划。

Result: 与Q学习的实验对比表明，该方法实现完美安全、行为可解释、无无效动作且收敛高效。

Conclusion: 此工作为强化学习提供了基于构造性逻辑和证明理论的新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

### [4] [Towards Data Systems That Are Business Semantic-Centric and AI Agents-Assisted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05520)
*Cecil Pang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出以业务语义为中心、AI 代理辅助的数据系统 BSDS，解决现有数据平台不足，经实践验证有良好效果，还给出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代企业需快速适应动态环境，但现有数据平台重工具轻业务需求，导致效率低和延迟。

Method: 提出 BSDS 系统，有模块化架构，含关联业务实体的数据、知识库和数据管道；AI 代理辅助；结合优化的工作流；考虑人的因素。

Result: 经实际实施验证，BSDS 加速数据驱动计划上市时间，增强跨职能协作，为各规模企业提供可扩展蓝图。

Conclusion: BSDS 可将数据系统转变为业务成功的积极推动者，未来可基于其用复杂系统和自适应网络理论探索优化策略及开发自主数据系统。

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

### [5] [Avoiding Death through Fear Intrinsic Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05529)
*Rodney Sanchez,Ferat Sahin,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文受生物和心理概念启发，引入受早期杏仁核发育启发的内在奖励函数，通过MANN架构实现，在Miniworld Sidewalk环境中展示避免行为，得到生物启发的神经架构和恐惧条件范式框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法评估需工程化外在奖励，且现实环境含高负奖励无反馈状态，如死亡，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入受早期杏仁核发育启发的内在奖励函数，通过新颖的记忆增强神经网络（MANN）架构产生内在奖励。

Result: 内在动机能阻止对终端状态的探索，产生类似动物恐惧条件的避免行为，修改恐惧响应阈值能产生符合广泛性焦虑症范式的行为，在Miniworld Sidewalk环境中得到验证。

Conclusion: 得到生物启发的神经架构和恐惧条件范式框架，构建的智能体可解决非描述性终端条件的环境。

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

### [6] [When Models Know More Than They Can Explain: Quantifying Knowledge Transfer in Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05579)
*Quan Shi,Carlos E. Jimenez,Shunyu Yao,Nick Haber,Diyi Yang,Karthik Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍KITE框架开展大规模人类研究，发现模型基准性能与协作结果关系不一致，需专门优化知识转移，并识别出影响因素，还公布相关资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI推理进步是否带来更好的知识转移，即模型能否以人类可理解、应用和学习的方式交流推理。

Method: 引入KITE框架，进行大规模人类研究，分两阶段让人类先与AI构思策略，再独立实施解决方案。

Result: 模型基准性能与协作结果的关系不一致，有显著异常值。

Conclusion: 知识转移需要专门优化，分析确定了影响成功知识转移的行为和战略因素，公布资源支持后续研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

### [7] [MMTU: A Massive Multi-Task Table Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05587)
*Junjie Xing,Yeye He,Mengyu Zhou,Haoyu Dong,Shi Han,Lingjiao Chen,Dongmei Zhang,Surajit Chaudhuri,H. V. Jagadish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍大规模基准MMTU，含超30K问题、25个真实表格任务，用于评估模型专家级表格处理能力，前沿模型表现不佳，代码数据开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型表格能力综合基准有限，表格相关任务评估稀缺且片面，限制该领域理解与模型进展。

Method: 引入MMTU基准，涵盖25个来自计算机科学研究的真实表格任务，用其评估模型。

Result: MMTU要求多种技能，前沿模型如OpenAI o4 - mini和DeepSeek R1得分仅约60%，有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: 希望MMTU基准推动结构化数据处理分析基础模型的理解与发展。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMTU-benchmark/MMTU.

### [8] [Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05616)
*Lianhao Zhou,Hongyi Ling,Keqiang Yan,Kaiji Zhao,Xiaoning Qian,Raymundo Arróyave,Xiaofeng Qian,Shuiwang Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MAPPS框架用于晶体材料发现，可提高自主性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计具有更高自主性的语言智能体用于晶体材料发现，突破现有研究局限。

Method: 提出MAPPS框架，包含工作流规划器、工具代码生成器和科学中介，使用大语言模型等技术。

Result: 在MP - 20数据上评估，稳定性、唯一性和新颖率比先前生成模型提高五倍。

Conclusion: MAPPS是用于自主材料发现的有前景的框架。

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出新颖偏好学习框架，从成对比较数据推断评估者群体分布，构建满足公理的策略，用软最大松弛法权衡表现，并通过实验验证其有效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法聚合偏好时倾向多数意见，可能导致策略偏向某些意见或群体，需开发能使聚合意见和策略与评估者偏好真实群体分布成比例的框架。

Method: 直接从成对比较数据推断评估者群体分布的可行集，构建满足社会选择理论公理及新引入公理的策略，提出软最大松弛法权衡表现。

Result: 通过表格推荐任务和大规模语言模型对齐实验验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提出的偏好学习框架有效且可扩展，能使聚合意见和策略与评估者偏好真实群体分布成比例。

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型虽表现优异，但成功的内在机制不明，需研究。

Method: 引入推理图概念，聚类各推理步骤的隐藏状态表示，分析循环性、直径和小世界指数等图论属性。

Result: 蒸馏推理模型比基础模型有更多循环、更大图直径和明显小世界特征，结构优势随任务难度和模型容量增长，与准确率正相关，监督微调可扩大推理图直径并提升性能。

Conclusion: 本研究结合推理图结构理论与数据构建实践建议，提高了大型推理模型的可解释性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

TL;DR: 介绍SPRINT框架使大推理模型在推理过程中动态并行化，减少推理时间且不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型推理时生成顺序思维链长，推理时间久，需解决该问题。

Method: 引入SPRINT框架，含数据整理流程，用少量整理数据微调模型，使其识别并并行执行子任务。

Result: 微调模型在数学等复杂领域表现相当，在长输出问题上减少顺序token，在两个分布外任务中也有减少顺序token且性能相当。

Conclusion: SPRINT框架能有效减少大推理模型推理时的顺序token，提高推理效率且不影响性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Motivation: 现有受限解码方法会扭曲模型分布，在程序模糊测试等应用中有局限，需要改进。

Result: 在合成基准和实际程序模糊测试任务中，所提采样器优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提基于MCMC的受限采样框架能同时满足约束满足、单调收敛和高效三个核心要求，是有效的方法。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

Motivation: 人工智能在敏感领域应用增加，需要既准确又可解释、值得信赖的系统，但现有可解释AI方法未考虑不同受众。

Method: 提出包含算法与领域、以人为本、社会可解释性三个层次的多层次框架，强调大语言模型在增强社会层面的作用，并结合案例研究。

Result: 该方法有助于实现技术保真、用户参与和社会责任。

Conclusion: 可将XAI重塑为一个动态的、建立信任的过程。

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user
engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic,
trust-building process.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming
visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and
labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address
these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key
contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that
synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset,
a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants
capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page:

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Motivation: 现有城市犯罪建模方法存在预测准确性、可解释性及适应环境变化能力不足的问题，需新方法。

Method: 提出CrimeMind框架，集成RAT理论，用无训练文本梯度法让其感知与人类判断对齐。

Result: 在四个美国城市实验中，CrimeMind在犯罪热点预测和空间分布准确性上优于传统ABM和深度学习基线，最高提升24%，能模拟反事实场景。

Conclusion: CrimeMind可对个体行为进行细粒度建模，便于评估现实干预措施。

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

Method: 引入CP - Bench数据集，比较评估大语言模型在三种不同约束建模系统的建模能力，评估提示和推理计算方法。

Conclusion: 新数据集和评估方法能有效评估大语言模型在约束编程建模中的能力，提示和推理方法可提升准确率。

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

Result: 在真实数据集上评估，与现有多目标行程规划算法对比实验，表明该方法更优，问题规模越大优势越明显。

Conclusion: 所提算法在大规模行程规划中表现出色，具有优越性。

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

solvers have adopted an ILP solver as part of their portfolios. This paper
investigates the impact of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) preprocessing

techniques help WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024
in the unweighted track, solve 15 additional instances. Moreover, current
state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily use an ILP solver in their portfolios,
while our proposed approach reduces the need to call an ILP solver in a
portfolio including WMaxCDCL or MaxCDCL.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型代理采用一刀切方法，缺乏灵活性，无法满足用户多样需求和偏好。

Method: 开发PersonaAgent框架，集成个性化记忆和行动模块，以用户独有的系统提示为中介连接两者，提出测试时用户偏好对齐策略优化提示。

Result: 实验表明PersonaAgent显著优于其他基线方法，能有效个性化行动空间并在实际应用中可扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法可行且有潜力提供定制化、动态的用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Motivation: 离线强化学习因数据有限有高认知不确定性，现有方法依赖固定保守策略，适应性和泛化性受限。

Method: 提出Reflect - then - Plan (RefPlan)，一种新颖的双贝叶斯离线基于模型的规划方法，将规划重铸为贝叶斯后验估计，在部署时用实时观测更新对环境动态的信念，通过边缘化将不确定性纳入基于模型的规划。

Result: 在标准基准测试上，RefPlan显著提高保守离线强化学习策略的性能。

Conclusion: RefPlan在高认知不确定性和有限数据下保持稳健性能，对环境动态变化有恢复力，提升了离线学习策略的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的嵌入有潜力改善查询性能，为无训练、基于嵌入的优化器指导系统开辟新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,

Result: 模型实现显著优于生产级替代方案，在执行时间和吞吐量上表现更好，且功能更丰富。

Conclusion: Stream DaQ可无缝集成到现代数据科学工作流，使广大数据科学社区能进行持续质量监控。

Abstract: Data quality is fundamental to modern data science workflows, where data
continuously flows as unbounded streams feeding critical downstream tasks, from
elementary analytics to advanced artificial intelligence models. Existing data
quality approaches either focus exclusively on static data or treat streaming
as an extension of batch processing, lacking the temporal granularity and
contextual awareness required for true streaming applications. In this paper,
we present a novel data quality monitoring model specifically designed for
unbounded data streams. Our model introduces stream-first concepts, such as
configurable windowing mechanisms, dynamic constraint adaptation, and
continuous assessment that produces quality meta-streams for real-time pipeline
awareness. To demonstrate practical applicability, we developed Stream DaQ, an
open-source Python framework that implements our theoretical model. Stream DaQ
unifies and adapts over 30 quality checks fragmented across existing static
tools into a comprehensive streaming suite, enabling practitioners to define
sophisticated, context-aware quality constraints through compositional
expressiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model's implementation
significantly outperforms a production-grade alternative in both execution time
and throughput while offering richer functionality via native streaming
capabilities compared to other choices. Through its Python-native design,
Stream DaQ seamlessly integrates with modern data science workflows, making
continuous quality monitoring accessible to the broader data science community.

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

Motivation: 传统HPAs无法应对资源中断问题，导致资源浪费、服务不可用和性能下降，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 扩展Smart HPA，提出SecureSmart HPA，监控资源需求、检测中断、评估浪费并动态调整缩放决策，还支持微服务间资源共享。

Result: 在不同中断严重程度下实验，SecureSmart HPA可使CPU过度使用最多降低57.2%，资源分配最多增加51.1%。

Conclusion: SecureSmart HPA能在不稳定和资源受限环境中实现有弹性且高效的自动缩放操作。

Abstract: Horizontal Pod Auto-scalers (HPAs) are crucial for managing resource
allocation in microservice architectures to handle fluctuating workloads.
However, traditional HPAs fail to address resource disruptions caused by
faults, cyberattacks, maintenance, and other operational challenges. These
disruptions result in resource wastage, service unavailability, and HPA
performance degradation. To address these challenges, we extend our prior work
on Smart HPA and propose SecureSmart HPA, which offers resilient and
resource-efficient auto-scaling for microservice architectures. SecureSmart HPA
monitors microservice resource demands, detects disruptions, evaluates resource
wastage, and dynamically adjusts scaling decisions to enhance the resilience of
auto-scaling operations. Furthermore, SecureSmart HPA enables resource sharing
among microservices, optimizing scaling efficiency in resource-constrained
environments. Experimental evaluation at varying disruption severities, with
25%, 50%, and 75% resource wastage, demonstrates that SecureSmart HPA performs
effectively across different levels of disruptions. It achieves up to a 57.2%
reduction in CPU overutilization and a 51.1% increase in resource allocation
compared to Smart HPA, highlighting its ability to deliver resilient and
efficient auto-scaling operations in volatile and resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Wireless communication provides great advantages that are not available
through their wired counterparts such as flexibility, ease of deployment and
use, cost reductions, and convenience. Wireless multi-hop networks (WMN) do not
have any centralized management infrastructure. Wireless multi-hop networks
have many benefits since proposed. In such networks when a node wants to send a
packet to a destination where is not in the transmission range, depend on some
intermediate nodes. In this type of networks packet sending is in the form of
multiple hop until destination and this work is dynamic. Lack of centralized
management cause that some nodes show malicious function. Malicious nodes are
that receive packets and drop them maliciously. These malicious nodes could
have many reasons such as hardware failure, software failure or lack of power.
Such nodes make multiple packets drop from the network and the performance of
network strongly decreases. As a result, the throughput of the network
decrease, increase end-to-end delay and increase overhead. Therefore, we must
aware from presence of malicious node in the network and do routing based on
this awareness. Therefore, this paper aims to study and review the present
malicious node detection methods that proposed in literatures. We categorized
networks in groups, including ad hoc networks, MANET, DTN, Opportunistic

Conclusion: 不同模型下算法复杂度不同，随机算法在端口编号模型有效，KT_1假设下确定性算法有更好复杂度，且结果在标准CONGEST模型也成立。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a perfect matching problem in a
synchronous distributed network, where the network topology corresponds to a
complete bipartite graph. The communication between nodes is restricted to
activating communication links, which means that instead of sending messages
containing a number of bits, each node can only send a pulse over some of its
incident links in each round. In the port numbering model, where nodes are
unaware of their neighbor's IDs, we give a randomized algorithm that terminates
in $O( \log n )$ rounds and has a pulse complexity of $O( n\log n )$, which
corresponds to the number of pulses sent over all links. We also show that
randomness is crucial in the port numbering model, as any deterministic
algorithm must send at least $\Omega( n^2 )$ messages in the standard LOCAL
model, where the messages can be of unbounded size. Then, we turn our attention
to the KT_1 assumption, where each node starts out knowing its neighbors' IDs.
We show that this additional knowledge enables significantly improved bounds
even for deterministic algorithms. First, we give an $O( \log n )$ time
deterministic algorithm that sends only $O( n )$ pulses. Finally, we apply this
algorithm recursively to obtain an exponential reduction in the time complexity
to $O( \log^*n\log\log n )$, while slightly increasing the pulse complexity to
$O( n\log^*n )$. All our bounds also hold in the standard CONGEST model with
single-bit messages.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

Result: 针对两个经典搜索问题设计出能实现类似权衡的算法。

Conclusion: 差分隐私可用于解决搜索问题的自适应查询，通过特定参数设计的算法能返回解向量。

Abstract: Recently differential privacy has been used for a number of streaming, data
structure, and dynamic graph problems as a means of hiding the internal
randomness of the data structure, so that multiple possibly adaptive queries
can be made without sacrificing the correctness of the responses. Although
these works use differential privacy to show that for some problems it is
possible to tolerate $T$ queries using $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ copies of a
data structure, such results only apply to numerical estimation problems, and
only return the cost of an optimization problem rather than the solution
itself. In this paper, we investigate the use of differential privacy for
adaptive queries to search problems, which are significantly more challenging
since the responses to queries can reveal much more about the internal
randomness than a single numerical query. We focus on two classical search
problems: nearest neighbor queries and regression with arbitrary turnstile
updates. We identify key parameters to these problems, such as the number of
$c$-approximate near neighbors and the matrix condition number, and use
different differential privacy techniques to design algorithms returning the
solution vector with memory and time depending on these parameters. We give
algorithms for each of these problems that achieve similar tradeoffs.

Conclusion: SVE概念和对应算法可有效解答交通条件使最短交通感知路线与最短无交通路线不同的问题。

Abstract: Users of routing services like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze frequently
wonder why a given route is proposed. This question particularly arises when
dynamic conditions like traffic and road closures cause unusual routes to be
proposed. While many dynamic conditions may exist in a road network at any
time, only a small fraction of those conditions are typically relevant to a
given user's route. In this work, we introduce the concept of a simple valid
explanation (SVE), which consists of a small set of traffic-laden road segments
that answer the following question: Which traffic conditions cause a particular
shortest traffic-aware route to differ from the shortest traffic-free route? We
give an efficient algorithm for finding SVEs and show that they theoretically
and experimentally lead to small and interpretable answers to the question.

Conclusion: 安全投标策略在实际中很有吸引力。

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

Result: 简化的博弈论模型展示了不同算法优先级可改变创作者策略。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解社交媒体影响力的均衡动态提供了见解。

Abstract: Social media platforms are ecosystems in which many decisions are constantly
made for the benefit of the creators in order to maximize engagement, which
leads to a maximization of income. The decisions, ranging from collaboration to
public conflict or ``beefing,'' are heavily influenced by social media
algorithms, viewer preferences, and sponsor risk. This paper models this
interaction as a Stackelberg game in which the algorithm is the leader, setting
exposure and reward rules, and the content creators are the followers, who
optimize their content to maximize engagement. It focuses on two influencer
strategies of collaborating and beefing. Viewer preferences are modeled
indirectly through the algorithm's utility function, which rewards engagement
metrics like click-through rate and watch time. Our simplified game-theoretic
model demonstrates how different algorithmic priorities can shift creator
strategies and provides insight into the equilibrium dynamics of social media
influence.

Conclusion: 为未来大语言模型的可持续和公平数据市场奠定了原则基础。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods for subadditive
agents. While constant-\textsf{MMS} bounds have been given for additive and
fractionally subadditive agents, the best existential bound for the case of
subadditive agents is $1/O(\log n \log \log n)$. In this work, we improve this
bound to a $1/O((\log \log n)^2)$-\textsf{MMS} guarantee. To this end, we
introduce new matching techniques and rounding methods for subadditive
valuations that we believe are of independent interest and will find their
applications in future work.

Abstract: We study a new class of contract design problems where a principal delegates
the execution of multiple projects to a set of agents. The principal's expected
reward from each project is a combinatorial function of the agents working on
it. Each agent has limited capacity and can work on at most one project, and
the agents are heterogeneous, with different costs and contributions for
participating in different projects. The main challenge of the principal is to
decide how to allocate the agents to projects when the number of projects grows
in scale.
  We analyze this problem under different assumptions on the structure of the
expected reward functions. As our main result, for XOS functions we show how to
derive a constant approximation to the optimal multi-project contract in
polynomial time, given access to value and demand oracles. Along the way (and
of possible independent interest), we develop approximate demand queries for
\emph{capped} subadditive functions, by reducing to demand queries for the
original functions. Our work paves the way to combinatorial contract design in
richer settings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned
by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost
$\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of
items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq
U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer
has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the
sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are
incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of
the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a
set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le
B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the
literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and
various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor
approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular,
and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known
approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given
access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the
number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a budget-feasible
mechanism for subadditive valuations that \emph{achieves a
substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in
polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.}

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

Conclusion: 近似本假设且学校需求不超供给的市场应设计尽可能长的偏好列表，以利于所有参与者。

Abstract: Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong
theoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the
preferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that
participants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over
agents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often
very large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of
all options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the
impact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant
matching.
  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where
each agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of
length $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools,
each of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students
primarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to
ending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\leq n$ will prefer
markets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand
will always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the
impact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.
  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our
hypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be
designed with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would
favor all agents.

Conclusion: 直接证实了SPGs已知的NP∩coNP复杂度，为回合制随机博弈中奇偶和可达性目标之间的关系提供了新见解。

Abstract: Significant progress has been recently achieved in developing efficient
solutions for simple stochastic games (SSGs), focusing on reachability
objectives. While reductions from stochastic parity games (SPGs) to SSGs have
been presented in the literature through the use of multiple intermediate game
models, a direct and simple reduction has been notably absent. This paper
introduces a novel and direct polynomial-time reduction from quantitative SPGs
to quantitative SSGs. By leveraging a gadget-based transformation that
effectively removes the priority function, we construct an SSG that simulates
the behavior of a given SPG. We formally establish the correctness of our
direct reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under binary encoding this
reduction is polynomial, thereby directly corroborating the known
$\textbf{NP}\,\mathbf{\cap}\,\textbf{coNP}$ complexity of SPGs and providing
new understanding in the relationship between parity and reachability
objectives in turn-based stochastic games.

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

Conclusion: NGA是一种有效的工业在线广告拍卖框架，能更好地满足在线广告拍卖的需求。

Abstract: Online advertising auctions are fundamental to internet commerce, demanding
solutions that not only maximize revenue but also ensure incentive
compatibility, high-quality user experience, and real-time efficiency. While
recent learning-based auction frameworks have improved context modeling by
capturing intra-list dependencies among ads, they remain limited in addressing
global externalities and often suffer from inefficiencies caused by sequential
processing. In this work, we introduce the Non-autoregressive Generative
Auction with global externalities (NGA), a novel end-to-end framework designed
for industrial online advertising. NGA explicitly models global externalities
by jointly capturing the relationships among ads as well as the effects of
adjacent organic content. To further enhance efficiency, NGA utilizes a
non-autoregressive, constraint-based decoding strategy and a parallel
multi-tower evaluator for unified list-wise reward and payment computation.
Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B testing on commercial
advertising platforms demonstrate that NGA consistently outperforms existing

TL;DR: 提出轻量级语义ID推荐框架RPG，能并行预测长语义ID，提升性能和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语义ID的生成式推荐模型推理效率低，语义ID长度受限、表达能力不足。

Method: 提出RPG框架，产生无序长语义ID，用多令牌预测损失独立预测每个令牌，推理时构建图引导解码。

Result: 将语义ID长度扩展到64，RPG在NDCG@10上平均比生成式基线模型高12.6%，且提高了推理效率。

Conclusion: RPG框架有效解决了现有模型的问题，提升了推荐性能和推理效率。

Abstract: Semantic ID-based recommendation models tokenize each item into a small
number of discrete tokens that preserve specific semantics, leading to better
performance, scalability, and memory efficiency. While recent models adopt a
generative approach, they often suffer from inefficient inference due to the
reliance on resource-intensive beam search and multiple forward passes through
the neural sequence model. As a result, the length of semantic IDs is typically
restricted (e.g. to just 4 tokens), limiting their expressiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose RPG, a lightweight framework for semantic ID-based
recommendation. The key idea is to produce unordered, long semantic IDs,
allowing the model to predict all tokens in parallel. We train the model to
predict each token independently using a multi-token prediction loss, directly
integrating semantics into the learning objective. During inference, we
construct a graph connecting similar semantic IDs and guide decoding to avoid
generating invalid IDs. Experiments show that scaling up semantic ID length to
64 enables RPG to outperform generative baselines by an average of 12.6% on the
NDCG@10, while also improving inference efficiency. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法难以捕捉用户潜在偏好和复杂关系，个性化金融产品推荐需求增长。

Method: 提出混合框架，用预训练大语言模型编码文本数据，构建异质用户 - 产品图，通过定制消息传递机制在图神经网络中融合文本和图信息。

Result: 在公开和真实金融数据集上实验显示，模型在准确率、召回率和 NDCG 方面优于单独的大语言模型或图神经网络，且有强解释性。

Conclusion: 为个性化金融推荐和更广泛推荐任务中的跨模态融合提供新见解。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'
latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework
integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial
recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文指出基于大语言模型的检索增强生成（RAG）在处理叙事文档时存在问题，构建了ChronoQA基准测试，提出E^2RAG框架，在测试中表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理有时间结构的叙事文档时存在不足，标准非结构化RAG方法缺乏对时间信息的编码和利用机制，知识图谱RAG框架会抹去实体的演变上下文。

Method: 构建ChronoQA基准测试来衡量RAG在叙事文档中的性能；提出Entity - Event RAG (E^2RAG) 双图框架，保留实体和事件子图并通过二分映射连接。

Result: 在ChronoQA上，E^2RAG方法优于现有的非结构化和基于知识图谱的RAG基线，在因果和角色一致性查询上有显著提升。

Conclusion: E^2RAG为需要基于时间信息给出精确答案的任务提供了更具上下文感知的检索途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on large language models often
falters on narrative documents with inherent temporal structures. Standard
unstructured RAG methods rely solely on embedding-similarity matching and lack
any general mechanism to encode or exploit chronological information, while
knowledge graph RAG (KG-RAG) frameworks collapse every mention of an entity
into a single node, erasing the evolving context that drives many queries. To
formalize this challenge and draw the community's attention, we construct
ChronoQA, a robust and discriminative QA benchmark that measures temporal,
causal, and character consistency understanding in narrative documents (e.g.,
novels) under the RAG setting. We then introduce Entity-Event RAG (E^2RAG), a
dual-graph framework that keeps separate entity and event subgraphs linked by a
bipartite mapping, thereby preserving the temporal and causal facets needed for
fine-grained reasoning. Across ChronoQA, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art unstructured and KG-based RAG baselines, with notable gains on
causal and character consistency queries. E^2RAG therefore offers a practical
path to more context-aware retrieval for tasks that require precise answers
grounded in chronological information.

Abstract: Generative AI (genAI) technologies -- specifically, large language models
(LLMs) -- and search have evolving relations. We argue for a novel perspective:
using genAI to enrich a document corpus so as to improve query-based retrieval
effectiveness. The enrichment is based on modifying existing documents or
generating new ones. As an empirical proof of concept, we use LLMs to generate
documents relevant to a topic which are more retrievable than existing ones. In
addition, we demonstrate the potential merits of using corpus enrichment for
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and answer attribution in question
answering.

Method: 提出MTMH模型，包含多任务学习损失和多头I2I检索架构。

Result: 使用商业平台数据评估，相比现有模型，召回率最多提升14.4%，语义相关性最多提升56.6%，实时实验证明能提升短期消费指标和长期用户体验指标。

Conclusion: 该工作为联合优化I2I召回率和语义相关性提供原则性方法，对提升推荐系统整体性能有重要意义。

Abstract: The task of item-to-item (I2I) retrieval is to identify a set of relevant and
highly engaging items based on a given trigger item. It is a crucial component
in modern recommendation systems, where users' previously engaged items serve
as trigger items to retrieve relevant content for future engagement. However,
existing I2I retrieval models in industry are primarily built on co-engagement
data and optimized using the recall measure, which overly emphasizes
co-engagement patterns while failing to capture semantic relevance. This often
leads to overfitting short-term co-engagement trends at the expense of
long-term benefits such as discovering novel interests and promoting content
diversity. To address this challenge, we propose MTMH, a Multi-Task and
Multi-Head I2I retrieval model that achieves both high recall and semantic
relevance. Our model consists of two key components: 1) a multi-task learning
loss for formally optimizing the trade-off between recall and semantic
relevance, and 2) a multi-head I2I retrieval architecture for retrieving both
highly co-engaged and semantically relevant items. We evaluate MTMH using
proprietary data from a commercial platform serving billions of users and
demonstrate that it can improve recall by up to 14.4% and semantic relevance by
up to 56.6% compared with prior state-of-the-art models. We also conduct live
experiments to verify that MTMH can enhance both short-term consumption metrics
and long-term user-experience-related metrics. Our work provides a principled
approach for jointly optimizing I2I recall and semantic relevance, which has
significant implications for improving the overall performance of
recommendation systems.

Motivation: 解决推荐系统跨领域需大量重新训练、传统基于ID方法在冷启动和跨领域场景失效的问题。

Method: 从文本特征导出物品表示，引入有限标量量化的统一物品分词、混合双向因果注意力、高效的目录感知束搜索解码器。

Result: 综合评估显示在六个数据集和工业场景中有一致的性能优势。

Conclusion: RecGPT通过领域不变的分词机制可自然地连接不同推荐场景。

Abstract: This work addresses a fundamental barrier in recommender systems: the
inability to generalize across domains without extensive retraining.
Traditional ID-based approaches fail entirely in cold-start and cross-domain
scenarios where new users or items lack sufficient interaction history.
Inspired by foundation models' cross-domain success, we develop a foundation
model for sequential recommendation that achieves genuine zero-shot
generalization capabilities. Our approach fundamentally departs from existing
ID-based methods by deriving item representations exclusively from textual
features. This enables immediate embedding of any new item without model
retraining. We introduce unified item tokenization with Finite Scalar
Quantization that transforms heterogeneous textual descriptions into
standardized discrete tokens. This eliminates domain barriers that plague
existing systems. Additionally, the framework features hybrid
bidirectional-causal attention that captures both intra-item token coherence
and inter-item sequential dependencies. An efficient catalog-aware beam search
decoder enables real-time token-to-item mapping. Unlike conventional approaches
confined to their training domains, RecGPT naturally bridges diverse
recommendation contexts through its domain-invariant tokenization mechanism.
Comprehensive evaluations across six datasets and industrial scenarios
demonstrate consistent performance advantages.

Conclusion: MTPNet通过条件深度学习内化交互模式，实现活性悬崖统一预测，有助于加速化合物优化和设计。

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

Motivation: ICRL存在状态 - 动作 - 奖励数据的多模态和决策任务的异质性两个挑战，需解决以充分利用上下文学习。

Method: 提出T2MIR框架，用token-wise MoE和task-wise MoE替换前馈层，引入对比学习方法增强任务路由。

Result: T2MIR显著提升上下文学习能力，优于多种基线。

Conclusion: 将MoE引入ICRL，提供简单可扩展的架构增强，推动ICRL发展。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Motivation: 传统最优执行策略如静态Almgren - Chriss模型在动态金融市场往往表现不佳，需要新方法解决。

Method: 提出flowOE框架，从多种传统专家策略学习，模仿过程中引入精炼损失函数，自适应选择适合当前市场条件的专家行为。

Result: 在各种市场条件下的实证评估显示，flowOE显著优于专门校准的专家模型和其他传统基准，能降低风险并提高利润。

Conclusion: flowOE具有实际应用价值和提升自适应最优执行的潜力。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

Conclusion: EqCollide是有效的可变形物体碰撞模拟方法，具有良好性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Conclusion: MCI - Diff框架能实现实时风险评估和高预测性能，可用于MCI转换的早期预测。

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

Motivation: 大语言模型因参数规模大在边缘部署面临挑战，现有向量量化方法存在问题，如方向和幅度耦合量化及欧氏距离度量导致量化误差大。

Method: 提出 Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector Quantization (PCDVQ) 框架，包含 Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD) 模块和 Distribution Aligned Codebook Construction (DACC) 模块。

Result: PCDVQ 在 2 比特水平上零样本准确率至少比基线方法高 1.5%。

Conclusion: PCDVQ 为精确且高度压缩的大语言模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

TL;DR: 提出Prefix Grouper算法优化GRPO，减少计算开销，提高可扩展性，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO处理长共享前缀时计算开销大，成为长上下文学习可扩展性瓶颈。

Method: 采用Shared - Prefix Forward策略，将自注意力重构为两部分，仅对共享前缀编码一次。

Result: Prefix Grouper与标准GRPO训练等效，显著降低训练计算成本，尤其在长前缀场景。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper可即插即用，能在相同计算预算下使用更大组大小，提升GRPO对复杂任务和大模型的可扩展性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now
available at https://github.com/johncaged/PrefixGrouper

Conclusion: 实验验证了零阶优化理论结果。

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 本文提出AutoQD方法自动生成行为描述符，解决传统QD算法依赖手工设计描述符的问题，实验证明其在无预定义描述符下发现多样策略的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统质量多样性（QD）算法严重依赖手工设计的行为描述符，限制了对多样性的探索。

Method: 利用策略和占用度量的等价性，通过将马尔可夫决策过程中策略的占用度量嵌入，使用随机傅里叶特征近似策略占用度量间的最大均值差异（MMD）创建嵌入，低维投影后的嵌入用作行为描述符。

Result: 证明嵌入会随采样轨迹数量和嵌入维度增加收敛到占用度量间的真实MMD距离，在多个连续控制任务实验中展示了AutoQD在无预定义描述符下发现多样策略的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督强化学习和QD优化提供了替代方案，为无需领域特定知识的顺序决策环境中的开放式学习和自动行为发现开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

Motivation: 经典共形预测在对抗攻击下保证失效，现有鲁棒共形预测方法在大规模问题中存在预测集过大或计算需求高的问题。

Method: 提出利用Lipschitz有界网络估计鲁棒共形预测集的lip - rcp方法，研究受攻击下普通共形预测并推导最坏情况覆盖界限。

Result: lip - rcp方法在中大规模场景如ImageNet中，在鲁棒共形预测集大小和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: lip - rcp方法有效，能使受攻击下普通共形预测方法高效且有鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

Motivation: 现有联邦微调方法难以解决灾难性遗忘问题，传统方法不适应联邦环境，数据分布和设备能力差异加剧问题。

Method: 提出 FedBE 框架，集成自适应变压器块扩展机制和动态可训练块分配策略，分离新知识与预训练表示，并根据客户端情况分配可训练块。

Result: 与现有方法相比，FedBE 在微调后通用任务上准确率保留提高 12 - 74%，模型收敛加速 1.9 - 3.1 倍，且不降低下游任务准确率。

Conclusion: FedBE 能更好适应异构联邦环境，增强模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效检测包装状态，模型精度高、尺寸小且功耗合理。

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series,
demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.

Motivation: 现有HI构建方法依赖专家知识进行特征提取，且忽视序列退化过程中的动态信息，限制了HI对退化趋势的表征和预测能力。

Method: 先通过基于跳跃连接的自编码器组成的退化特征学习模块将原始信号映射到退化特征空间以自动提取特征，再在该空间中用嵌入内部HI预测块的HI生成模块构建动态HI。

Result: 在两个轴承生命周期数据集上的实验结果表明，所提HI构建方法优于对比方法。

Conclusion: 所构建的动态HI能捕捉退化过程的动态内容，对退化趋势建模和未来退化预测更有效。

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

Motivation: 现有训练流动模型的方法存在训练慢和推理成本高的问题，理论上最优传输（OT）可带来高效流动，近期工作虽提出用OT求解器重新排序点对，但批量大小有限，需进一步探索。

Method: 增大批量大小n三到四个数量级，仔细研究Sinkhorn算法中熵正则化参数ε的影响，引入新的尺度不变量报告耦合锐度，利用多GPU或GPU节点的分片计算扩展n。

Result: 在合成和图像生成任务中，流动模型在使用大的Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化参数ε时表现更好。

Conclusion: 大的Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化对流动模型训练有显著好处。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Conclusion: UniPTMs框架有效提升多类型PTM预测性能，且开发的轻量级变体可平衡模型复杂度和性能。

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，DoSAC在混杂设置下优于基线，具有更好的鲁棒性、泛化性和策略可靠性。

Conclusion: DoSAC能有效解决强化学习中隐藏混杂因素带来的问题。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Result: 随着任务多样性增加，transformer从仅在预训练任务分布内表现ICL的专门化解决方案过渡到能分布外泛化到整个任务空间的解决方案，在非线性回归问题中也观察到类似转变。

Conclusion: 任务多样性对ICL的出现和分布外泛化有重要影响，且模型深度和回归问题维度等因素会影响这一转变。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

Method: 分析语言模型训练过程中损失曲线在对数 - 对数空间的表现，提出零和学习（ZSL）概念解释损失减速。

Result: 语言模型训练早期会出现损失减速，扩大模型规模可缓解；损失减速源于零和学习，即样本梯度相互对立导致损失变化相互干扰。

Conclusion: 损失减速和 ZSL 为语言模型缩放定律的训练动态提供新见解，可独立于规模改进语言模型。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决子群体分布偏移问题，在多种基准测试中表现良好。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard

Conclusion: 朝着阐明反向折叠模型自由能基础迈出了步伐，简单方法能有效提升零样本预测性能。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

Motivation: 探究诱导神经网络grokking现象的因素。

Method: 研究不同正则化方式（如l1、核范数正则化）、增加模型深度、改变数据选择等对grokking的影响。

Result: 正则化能诱导grokking；增加深度可在无显式正则化下实现或消除grokking；l2范数在特定正则化下不可靠；可通过数据选择放大grokking。

Conclusion: 多种因素（正则化、过参数化、数据选择）会影响神经网络的grokking现象。

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

Conclusion: CPQ框架适用于黑盒大语言模型的不确定性量化，在性能和信息性上有优势。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 在深度序数回归任务中存在ONC现象，证明了其特性，讨论了在序数回归中利用这些特性，强调固定阈值的使用。

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Conclusion: 使用同时具有物理和对称约束的PDE替代模型能提升性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Conclusion: 提出的方法可在简单频谱图上提高SGNNs的表达能力。

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Conclusion: Ravan是大语言模型联邦微调的稳健且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Conclusion: TabFlex在大规模数据集上效果好，结合降维、数据采样等技术可显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large
and complex datasets. Our work enhances the efficiency and scalability of
TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality
reduction and data sampling.

Motivation: 已有神经网络局部事后解释研究较多，但构建可解释神经网络架构的工作较少，因此提出新型架构。

Method: 提出受连分数启发的CoFrNet架构，采用不同证明策略证明其为通用近似器，并在非线性合成函数和七个真实数据集上进行实验。

Conclusion: CoFrNet架构具有较强的表示能力和可解释性，是一种有效的可解释神经网络架构。

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级时空Transformer FaCTR用于时间序列预测，性能优、参数少、可解释且支持自监督预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers在时间序列预测中因架构复杂出现收益递减，时间序列数据有低信息密度和复杂依赖的特点，需解决不匹配和参数过多问题。

Method: 提出FaCTR，通过可学习门控机制将低秩因子分解机建模的动态对称跨通道交互注入时间上下文块嵌入，进一步编码静态和动态协变量进行多变量调节。

Result: 在十一个公共预测基准上达到了最先进的性能，最大变体参数接近400K，平均比竞争的时空Transformer基线小50倍。

Conclusion: FaCTR结构紧凑、性能好、可解释，支持自监督预训练，可作为下游时间序列任务的基础。

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Method: 对多种控制问题进行实验。

Result: 具体展示了熵最大化在复杂控制任务中误导策略优化的效应。

Conclusion: 分析有助于更好地理解在具有挑战性的控制问题中如何平衡奖励设计和熵最大化。

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Result: 通过数值实验验证方法高效，能计算高维卷积映射完整奇异值集合及对应奇异向量。

Conclusion: 所提方法可扩展，为高维卷积映射奇异值计算提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Conclusion: 研究成果推动对化学语言模型生成机制的理解和引导。

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 该技术能让小模型捕获特定任务所需的较窄范围知识。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，可提升生成模型数据归因效果。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Conclusion: BAQ在损失最小化和复杂度间取得良好平衡，可集成到标准量化流程，研究为性能提升提供理论解释。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA注册的AI医疗工具中仅有9%有部署后监测计划，现有监测方法不适合临床模型的动态环境。

Method: 将数据变化和模型性能下降的检测构建为统计假设检验问题，以统计严谨性为监测基础。

Result: 未提及具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 以统计为基础的监测为临床AI系统可靠性提供科学依据，为技术界开辟新研究方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 所提出的AACL框架能有效解决CL - DC问题，在跨动作空间的策略泛化上有更好表现。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

Result: 所提框架在低信噪比和分布偏移情况下显著优于传统神经网络语义通信基线。

Conclusion: 为未来6G系统中基于生成式人工智能的鲁棒语义传输指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

Motivation: LoRA在微调时易陷入次优极小值，影响模型泛化及下游操作。

Method: 提出CoTo策略，逐步增加适配器激活概率，随机停用适配器，进行理论分析并采用合作博弈方法量化贡献。

Result: 实验表明CoTo提升单任务性能、多任务合并准确率、剪枝鲁棒性，降低训练开销。

Conclusion: CoTo策略有效，能优化LoRA微调，且与多种LoRA变体兼容。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

Conclusion: 系统地结合算法改进有潜力，精心集成集成和多步方法可带来显著收益。

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

Conclusion: 新设计的损失函数能有效提升多标签分类性能，且不增加额外参数和计算复杂度。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Method: 形式化广义增量学习问题GILCD，提出CSFA框架，包括无训练原型校准机制和源自由适应算法RSGS，采用熵基不确定性过滤。

Result: 广泛实验验证了CSFA相较于现有方法具有优越性能和有效性。

Conclusion: CSFA为开放世界流式场景中语义和分布的稳定适应建立了统一框架。

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决现代RLHF流程中奖励模型训练成本高的瓶颈问题。

Method: 用单行JSON规则和秩为16的LoRA适配器增强冻结的7B指令微调LLM。

Result: 该模型在RewardBench上准确率达96.2%，使7B actor在GSM - 8K上超越70B DPO基线，在可解释性上GPT - 4评分接近人类解释。

Conclusion: 提示工程和小LoRA结合产生了经济高效、透明且易调整的奖励函数，去除离线阶段并取得新的最优结果。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff能有效利用关键状态扩展状态空间，促进数据集多样性，是一种有效的离线强化学习数据增强方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDO方法求解子问题需高精度，导致计算开销大，为降低计算开销并提高效率。

Method: 提出Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO)方法，放宽子问题精度要求并利用平均函数相似度。

Result: 实验表明SPDO显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPDO方法在PDO框架内达到了最优的通信和计算复杂度。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to
ongoing research in machine learning and data science.

Result: PiPE在分子属性预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: PiPE方法推进了图表示学习的前沿，代码开源。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

Conclusion: WDAN是一个有效的、模型无关的框架，能解决时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，提高预测精度。代码可在https://github.com/MonBG/WDAN获取。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Conclusion: 该算法是首个专为聚类集成设计的可解释算法，为可解释聚类的未来研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of

### [135] [Quantifying Adversarial Uncertainty in Evidential Deep Learning using Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05937)
*Charmaine Barker,Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou*

TL;DR: 本文提出冲突感知证据深度学习（C - EDL）方法，可增强对抗和OOD鲁棒性，实验表明其显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型可靠性对高风险应用至关重要，现有证据深度学习（EDL）易受对抗输入影响，会产生过度自信错误。

Method: C - EDL是轻量级事后不确定性量化方法，为每个输入生成多样、保留任务的变换，量化表征分歧以校准不确定性估计。

Result: C - EDL显著优于现有EDL变体和竞争基线，在多种数据集、攻击类型和不确定性指标下，OOD数据覆盖度最多降低55%，对抗数据覆盖度最多降低90%。

Conclusion: C - EDL能有效提高模型在对抗和OOD输入下的鲁棒性，且计算开销低，维持高分布内准确率。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

Motivation: 去噪扩散和流匹配在表格数据生成应用受限，需开发新方法。

Method: 开发TabbyFlow，引入EF - VFM，基于矩匹配获目标函数，建立变分流匹配与广义流匹配联系。

Result: 在表格数据基准测试中相比基线模型有最优表现。

Conclusion: TabbyFlow方法在表格数据生成中有效，有较好应用前景。

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

Motivation: 准确预测对企业至关重要，具有竞争优势，该研究旨在评估应用于实体零售数据集的预测模型。

Method: 构建预测框架解决零售环境问题，比较树基集成（如XGBoost和LightGBM）和神经网络架构（如N - BEATS、NHITS和Temporal Fusion Transformer）在不同实验设置下的表现。

Result: 局部建模策略，特别是在未插补数据的个别组上使用树基模型，能持续提供更优的预测准确性和计算效率；神经模型受益于高级插补方法，但处理实体零售数据的不规则性仍不足。

Conclusion: 研究结果增进了对零售环境中模型选择的实际理解，强调了数据预处理对提高预测性能的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,
unexplored area with promising potential. This work presents a novel method for
the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

Result: 在约束控制任务上对C - PG的基于动作（C - PGAE）和基于参数（C - PGPE）变体进行实验，对比现有基线方法。

Conclusion: C - PG算法有效，特别是训练后部署确定性策略时。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

Result: 通过理论分析和大量实验，PrunE实现了出色的分布外性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PrunE通过剪枝虚假边能更全面保留不变子图，提升图神经网络分布外泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 扩散模型推理对硬件资源要求高，现有模型量化策略多采用均匀标量量化，而向量量化在大语言模型量化中取得成功，因此尝试将其用于扩散模型压缩。

Method: 应用基于码本的加性向量量化方法对扩散模型进行压缩。

Result: 在LDM - 4的标准类条件基准测试上取得新的帕累托前沿，在W4A8时sFID比全精度模型低1.92点，在W2A8时FID、sFID和ISC有最佳报告结果，还通过高效推理内核展示了任意硬件上的FLOPs节省。

Conclusion: 基于码本的加性向量量化可有效用于扩散模型压缩，在极低比特权重量化方面表现良好并能实现FLOPs节省。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Conclusion: 将贝尔曼最优算子引入演员 - 评论家框架，配合退火方法可加速学习并减少偏差，提升算法性能。

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

Conclusion: LaDEEP在弹塑性固体大变形计算中兼具精度和效率，适用于实际工业应用。

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 成员推理测试在放宽定义后依然不可靠，存在训练数据投毒导致测试错误的问题。

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

Conclusion: 显式建模更适合具有不同耦合模式的多固体系统，可避免信息混合和混淆。

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is
avaiable at \href{this link}{https://github.com/therontau0054/Unisoma}.

Result: 能在不了解底层因果图的情况下准确估计因果效应，消融实验显示Do - PFN在不同因果特征数据集上具有可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 预训练PFNs可有效应用于因果效应估计问题。

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

Result: ROBIN在2D和3D固体力学基准测试中达到了最先进的准确性，大幅超越现有模拟器，减少推理时间。

Conclusion: ROBIN有效解决了现有图基学习模拟器的局限，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

Motivation: 标准不确定性估计技术难以清晰区分可靠和不可靠预测，原因是分类器权重有噪声影响细粒度统计信息。

Method: 提出一种新的测试时优化方法，考虑噪声影响以产生更可靠的置信度估计。

Result: 该方法定义的分数对应单调子集选择函数，移除低分样本时总体准确率提升，在AUSE和AURC等标准风险指标上表现出色，还能识别训练和测试分布差异等。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效解决现有不确定性估计技术的问题，具有良好性能和多种应用价值。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Result: 得到新定义及对应算法，理论分析了删除容量、准确率、内存和计算时间的权衡。

Conclusion: 新定义能让系统针对系统感知攻击者更安全高效地更新模型。

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

Result: 与现有工作相比，STOF在MHA计算中实现最高1.7倍加速，端到端推理实现最高1.5倍加速。

Conclusion: STOF框架能有效优化稀疏Transformer性能，提升计算和推理速度。

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

Conclusion: 该方法向基础模型专业化民主化迈出重要一步，能以最少计算需求实现基于语言的适配。

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering
performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure
meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted
$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and
extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing

Conclusion: 流注意力机制可有效增强基于注意力的GNN在图相关任务上的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Result: 一系列实验测试表明SAM - GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中有效。

Conclusion: 梯度大小相似性在多任务深度学习的梯度聚合正则化和学习过程优化中起关键作用。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Motivation: 表格推理对小语言模型有挑战，传统文本式表格推理有局限，应用基于程序的表格推理到小语言模型又有新问题，需解决这些局限。

Method: 提出两阶段P - TR方法Table - r1，第一阶段引入自监督学习任务提高表格布局泛化能力；第二阶段采用Group Relative Policy Optimization的混合范式变体，必要时可回退到文本式表格推理。

Result: 在四个表格推理基准测试中，Table - r1优于所有基于小语言模型的方法，在所有数据集上比基础模型（LLaMA - 8B）准确率至少提高15%，表现与大语言模型有竞争力。

Conclusion: Table - r1有效解决了小语言模型在表格推理中的问题，提高了推理性能。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型训练和部署与人类用户的反馈循环是否会导致用户现有价值观和信念固化，造成多样性丧失和错误信念锁定。

Method: 使用基于代理的大语言模型模拟和真实世界的GPT使用数据进行实证测试。

Result: 分析显示新GPT版本发布后出现多样性突然且持续的下降，与假设的人机反馈循环一致。

Conclusion: 大语言模型与人类用户的反馈循环可能会导致价值观和信念多样性的丧失，验证了假设。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Method: 引入幂均值校正到多重重要性加权估计器，提出RPG算法结合新旧轨迹更新策略。

Result: 理论证明RPG在既定假设下样本复杂度为$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$，是文献中已知最优速率，实验验证优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 广泛重用过往非策略轨迹能显著加速策略梯度方法收敛，RPG算法有效。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Conclusion: PINC能有效近似PDE解，无需迭代求解器，是工程中流体流动监测和优化的有前景替代方案。

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Conclusion: 这是首个在低保真稳态数值模拟中有效适应时变风况的基于深度强化学习的尾流转向控制器。

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明MGCL达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 将生成模型融入图对比学习具有优势。

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new

accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 扩展EP到随时间变化的输入是具有挑战性的问题，需要新的方法。

Result: GLEP根据系统边界条件产生不同学习算法，许多不实用；HEL是GLEP的特例。

Conclusion: HEL是GLEP中唯一继承了使EP成为硬件实现中反向传播理想替代方案特性的实例。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

Conclusion: 蒸馏可增强去学习鲁棒性，在蒸馏前加入去学习步骤是去除能力的便捷途径。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent
neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its
last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors,
RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for
reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based
RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing
method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation
that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper
systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC
systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also
propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6%
while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other
methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing
strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%
and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance
with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by
6.3${\times}$.

Abstract: Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) is a key part of evolutionary
machine learning, which commonly utilizes evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to
automatically design high-performing deep neural architectures. During past
years, various ENAS methods have been proposed with exceptional performance.
However, the theory research of ENAS is still in the infant. In this work, we
step for the runtime analysis, which is an essential theory aspect of EAs, of
ENAS upon multiclass classification problems. Specifically, we first propose a
benchmark to lay the groundwork for the analysis. Furthermore, we design a
two-level search space, making it suitable for multiclass classification
problems and consistent with the common settings of ENAS. Based on both
designs, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithms with one-bit and bit-wise mutations,
and analyze their upper and lower bounds on the expected runtime. We prove that
the algorithm using both mutations can find the optimum with the expected
runtime upper bound of $O(rM\ln{rM})$ and lower bound of $\Omega(rM\ln{M})$.
This suggests that a simple one-bit mutation may be greatly considered, given
that most state-of-the-art ENAS methods are laboriously designed with the
bit-wise mutation. Empirical studies also support our theoretical proof.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在医学图像识别应用受限，难以达到传统深度学习模型性能，需改进。

Method: 提出结合SNN与LZC的乳腺癌分类方法，探索LIF和LB神经元模型在不同学习机制下表现，用ANN - to - SNN转换方法实验。

Result: LB模型准确率超90%，LIF模型超85%，最高准确率98.25%，计算成本低至传统1/100。

Conclusion: SNN结合LZC为医学诊断提供有前景、生物合理的替代方案，适用于资源受限或实时系统。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) event-driven nature enables efficient encoding
of spatial and temporal features, making them suitable for dynamic
time-dependent data processing. Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have
seen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in
matching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this,
we propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs
with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of
sequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of
spike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our
study explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and
probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised,
and hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer
Wisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging.
LB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models
reached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an
ANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to
traditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower
computational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with
the efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower
computational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding,
spike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient
feature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer
promising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks
in medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time
systems.

that map out communication pathways and optimize data flow. It further explores
architectural variations suited to different degrees of agent autonomy and
system complexity. Real-world applications in domains such as real-time
financial processing and investment banking are discussed, illustrating how
these patterns and MCP can meet specific operational demands. The article
concludes by outlining open challenges, potential security risks, and promising
directions for advancing robust, interoperable, and scalable multi-agent LLM
ecosystems.

Conclusion: 为从业者选择最佳提示技术提供指导。

Abstract: A growing variety of prompt engineering techniques has been proposed for
Large Language Models (LLMs), yet systematic evaluation of each technique on
individual software engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. In this
study, we present a systematic evaluation of 14 established prompt techniques
across 10 SE tasks using four LLM models. As identified in the prior
literature, the selected prompting techniques span six core dimensions
(Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Thought Generation, Ensembling, Self-Criticism, and
Decomposition). They are evaluated on tasks such as code generation, bug
fixing, and code-oriented question answering, to name a few. Our results show
which prompting techniques are most effective for SE tasks requiring complex
logic and intensive reasoning versus those that rely more on contextual
understanding and example-driven scenarios. We also analyze correlations
between the linguistic characteristics of prompts and the factors that
contribute to the effectiveness of prompting techniques in enhancing
performance on SE tasks. Additionally, we report the time and token consumption
for each prompting technique when applied to a specific task and model,
offering guidance for practitioners in selecting the optimal prompting
technique for their use cases.

Motivation: 当前对IaC模板评估侧重于语法正确性，忽略了可部署性这一关键指标，需要填补该研究空白。

Method: 提出以可部署性为中心的框架IaCGen，利用迭代反馈机制生成IaC模板；构建可部署性基准测试DPIaC - Eval，涵盖153个真实场景。

Result: 现有LLM初始表现不佳，Claude - 3.5和Claude - 3.7首次部署成功率低；IaCGen显著提升性能，评估模型passItr@25超90%，Claude - 3.5和Claude - 3.7成功率达98%。

Conclusion: 工作首次全面评估以可部署性为中心的IaC模板生成，为未来研究奠定基础，同时指出用户意图对齐和安全合规性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的代理系统能为竞赛编程问题创建高质量测试用例，提升测试用例质量对评估和强化学习有益。

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: Centralized electrical/electronic architectures and High-Performance
Computers (HPCs) are redefining automotive software development, challenging
traditional microcontroller-based approaches. Ensuring real-time, safety, and
scalability in software-defined vehicles necessitates reevaluating how
mixed-criticality software is integrated into centralized architectures. While
existing research on automotive SoftWare Architectures (SWAs) is relevant to
the industry, it often lacks validation through systematic, empirical methods.
To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review focusing on
automotive mixed-criticality SWAs. Our goal is to provide practitioner-oriented
guidelines that assist automotive software architects and developers design
centralized, mixed-criticality SWAs based on a rigorous and transparent
methodology. First, we set up a systematic review protocol grounded in
established guidelines. Second, we apply this protocol to identify relevant
studies. Third, we extract key functional domains, constraints, and enabling
technologies that drive changes in automotive SWAs, thereby assessing the
protocol's effectiveness. Additionally, we extract techniques, architectural
patterns, and design practices for integrating mixed-criticality requirements
into HPC-based SWAs, further demonstrating the protocol's applicability. Based
on these insights, we propose an exemplary SWA for a microprocessor-based
system-on-chip. In conclusion, this study provides a structured approach to
explore and realize mixed-criticality software integration for next-generation
automotive SWAs, offering valuable insights for industry and research
applications.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating
computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However,
generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language
models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive
programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse
datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for
5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the
International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner
performance.

Conclusion: 所提出的系统能应对现有污点分析的挑战，且可通过开源平台供社区使用。

Abstract: Taint analysis using explicit whole-program data-dependence graphs is
powerful for vulnerability discovery but faces two major challenges. First,
accurately modeling taint propagation through calls to external library
procedures requires extensive manual annotations, which becomes impractical for
large ecosystems. Second, the sheer size of whole-program graph representations
leads to serious scalability and performance issues, particularly when quick
analysis is needed in continuous development pipelines.
  This paper presents the design and implementation of a system for a
language-agnostic data-dependence representation. The system accommodates
missing annotations describing the behavior of library procedures by
over-approximating data flows, allowing annotations to be added later without
recalculation. We contribute this data-flow analysis system to the open-source
code analysis platform Joern making it available to the community.

Conclusion: DesignBench为自动前端开发未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

Result: 最佳模型准确分类96.43%的交易，对合法和非法交易分类准确率高，误判率低，还生成特征排名。

Conclusion: 简单强大的自动化端到端方法可释放资源，金融和交易特征能揭露欺诈行为。

Abstract: According to The Exchange Act, 1934 unlawful insider trading is the abuse of
access to privileged corporate information. While a blurred line between
"routine" the "opportunistic" insider trading exists, detection of strategies
that insiders mold to maneuver fair market prices to their advantage is an
uphill battle for hand-engineered approaches. In the context of detailed
high-dimensional financial and trade data that are structurally built by
multiple covariates, in this study, we explore, implement and provide detailed
comparison to the existing study (Deng et al. (2019)) and independently
implement automated end-to-end state-of-art methods by integrating principal
component analysis to the random forest (PCA-RF) followed by a standalone
random forest (RF) with 320 and 3984 randomly selected, semi-manually labeled
and normalized transactions from multiple industry. The settings successfully
uncover latent structures and detect unlawful insider trading. Among the
multiple scenarios, our best-performing model accurately classified 96.43
percent of transactions. Among all transactions the models find 95.47 lawful as
lawful and $98.00$ unlawful as unlawful percent. Besides, the model makes very
few mistakes in classifying lawful as unlawful by missing only 2.00 percent. In
addition to the classification task, model generated Gini Impurity based
features ranking, our analysis show ownership and governance related features
based on permutation values play important roles. In summary, a simple yet
powerful automated end-to-end method relieves labor-intensive activities to
redirect resources to enhance rule-making and tracking the uncaptured unlawful
insider trading transactions. We emphasize that developed financial and trading
features are capable of uncovering fraudulent behaviors.

and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文针对现有因果发现方法的局限性，提出基于PANM的顺序过程确定CPDAG中无向边的因果方向，开发了非线性ANMs下学习因果DAG的算法，并验证其性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在模型假设限制、依赖独立性测试、计算时间长等问题。

Method: 提出顺序过程利用PANM确定CPDAG中无向边的因果方向；开发基于约束的算法学习非线性ANMs下的因果DAG；设计排名过程对无向边排序；设计统计测试确定边的方向。

Result: 证明该过程在受限ANM下可恢复真实因果DAG；建立算法在大样本下的结构学习一致性；实验表明方法计算高效、对模型误设稳健且性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决现有方法的局限性，在因果DAG学习中表现良好。

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Motivation: 现有神经SBI方法在模拟器计算成本高时性能受限，需提升其在有限计算预算下的性能。

Method: 提出一种利用多级蒙特卡罗技术的新型神经SBI方法，适用于有不同成本和保真度模拟器的场景。

Result: 通过理论分析和大量实验表明，在固定计算预算下该方法能显著提高SBI方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的新型方法能有效提升神经SBI在有限计算资源下的性能。

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估机器学习模型公平性是关键，有偏模型会加剧结构不平等，所以需要有效工具评估。

Method: 使用{fairmetrics} R包评估多种基于组的公平性标准，通过方便的包装函数提供多个指标的点和区间估计。

Result: {fairmetrics}能对众多基于组的公平性标准进行严格评估，还提供示例数据集。

Conclusion: {fairmetrics}为评估机器学习模型公平性提供了用户友好的框架。

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Result: 建立优化FP准则与SQ下界的等价关系，统一简化已知SQ下界推导，得到新SQ下界。

Conclusion: 改进的FP准则在统计推理计算复杂度领域有重要作用，能统一和拓展相关理论。

Abstract: Bandeira et al. (2022) introduced the Franz-Parisi (FP) criterion for
characterizing the computational hard phases in statistical detection problems.
The FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi
potential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree
polynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting
two distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in
statistical inference. In this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that
aims to better capture the geometric ``overlap" structure of statistical
models. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is
equivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds -- another foundational
framework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this
equivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad
class of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse
models, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI)
models, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of
convex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian
correlation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry.
  In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the
derivation of several known SQ lower bounds -- such as for the NGCA model
(Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024) -- but also
yields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the
computational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and
convex truncation (De et al., 2023).

Motivation: 在使用CAR的随机实验中，实际数据集除分层指标外还有额外协变量，需一种方法纳入这些协变量以提高分布处理效应估计的精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效利用额外协变量，提高分布处理效应估计的精度，在实际应用中有优势。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the estimation of distributional treatment effects in
randomized experiments that use covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR). These
include designs such as Efron's biased-coin design and stratified block
randomization, where participants are first grouped into strata based on
baseline covariates and assigned treatments within each stratum to ensure
balance across groups. In practice, datasets often contain additional
covariates beyond the strata indicators. We propose a flexible distribution
regression framework that leverages off-the-shelf machine learning methods to
incorporate these additional covariates, enhancing the precision of
distributional treatment effect estimates. We establish the asymptotic
distribution of the proposed estimator and introduce a valid inference
procedure. Furthermore, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for
distributional treatment effects under CAR and demonstrate that our
regression-adjusted estimator attains this bound. Simulation studies and
empirical analyses of microcredit programs highlight the practical advantages
of our method.

TL;DR: 针对现实时间序列非平稳性，提出移动估计器方法，聚焦其在alpha - Stable分布应用，并用金融数据展示其评估市场稳定性的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实时间序列具有非平稳性，经典ARMA - ARCH方法存在任意选定依赖类型的偏差，需更可靠方法。

Method: 采用移动估计器，对每个时间t单独估计参数，通过指数移动平均（EMA）更新参数，如绝对中心矩。

Result: 在DJIA金融时间序列上展示应用，能估计中心μ、尺度参数σ和α参数的演变。

Conclusion: 移动估计器可用于alpha - Stable分布的自适应估计，能连续评估市场稳定性，控制极端事件概率。

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

Result: 通过对加拿大啤酒风味话语的协变量效应分析展示了方法。

Conclusion: 所提倡的简单非参数方法比生成模型更快、更易解释，且有更好的推理依据。

Abstract: We introduce an approach to topic modelling with document-level covariates
that remains tractable in the face of large text corpora. This is achieved by
de-emphasizing the role of parameter estimation in an underlying probabilistic
model, assuming instead that the data come from a fixed but unknown
distribution whose statistical functionals are of interest. We propose
combining a convex formulation of non-negative matrix factorization with
standard regression techniques as a fast-to-compute and useful estimate of such
a functional. Uncertainty quantification can then be achieved by reposing
non-parametric resampling methods on top of this scheme. This is in contrast to
popular topic modelling paradigms, which posit a complex and often hard-to-fit
generative model of the data. We argue that the simple, non-parametric approach
advocated here is faster, more interpretable, and enjoys better inferential
justification than said generative models. Finally, our methods are
demonstrated with an application analysing covariate effects on discourse of
flavours attributed to Canadian beers.

Result: 新算法经验上优于现有最优算法，PDE的回火版本未加快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 提出的新算法有更好性能，PDE回火版本在收敛速度提升上无效。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It
is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the
space of probability distribution in which we aim to minimise the
Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$. We consider several partial
differential equations (PDEs) whose solution is a minimiser of the
Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$ and connect them to well-known Monte
Carlo algorithms. We focus in particular on PDEs obtained by considering the
Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry over the space of probabilities and show that
these lead to a natural implementation using importance sampling and sequential
Monte Carlo. We propose a novel algorithm to approximate the
Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao flow of the Kullback--Leibler divergence which
empirically outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
  We study tempered versions of these PDEs obtained by replacing the target
distribution with a geometric mixture of initial and target distribution and
show that these do not lead to a convergence speed up.

Abstract: Kernel-based hypothesis tests offer a flexible, non-parametric tool to detect
high-order interactions in multivariate data, beyond pairwise relationships.
Yet the scalability of such tests is limited by the computationally demanding
permutation schemes used to generate null approximations. Here we introduce a
family of permutation-free high-order tests for joint independence and partial
factorisations of $d$ variables. Our tests eliminate the need for
permutation-based approximations by leveraging V-statistics and a novel
cross-centring technique to yield test statistics with a standard normal
limiting distribution under the null. We present implementations of the tests
and showcase their efficacy and scalability through synthetic datasets. We also
show applications inspired by causal discovery and feature selection, which
highlight both the importance of high-order interactions in data and the need
for efficient computational methods.

Abstract: Stablecoins face an unresolved trilemma of balancing decentralization,
stability, and regulatory compliance. We present a hybrid stabilization
protocol that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures
contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to achieve robust price adherence
while preserving user privacy. At its core, the protocol introduces
stabilization futures contracts (SFCs), non-collateralized derivatives that
programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price
deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize
delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), while zkSNARKs prove
compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing
identities or transaction details. Our cryptographic design reduces cross-chain
liquidity concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in
single-chain systems) and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic
assumptions. The protocol's layered architecture encompassing
incentive-compatible SFCs, AI-driven market making, and zero-knowledge

Result: 在真实数据上对DPClustX进行广泛实验分析，表明其在严格隐私约束下也能提供有洞察力和准确的解释。

Conclusion: DPClustX能有效解决差分隐私下聚类结果解释问题，同时保证隐私性。

Abstract: The dire need to protect sensitive data has led to various flavors of privacy
definitions. Among these, Differential privacy (DP) is considered one of the
most rigorous and secure notions of privacy, enabling data analysis while
preserving the privacy of data contributors. One of the fundamental tasks of
data analysis is clustering , which is meant to unravel hidden patterns within
complex datasets. However, interpreting clustering results poses significant
challenges, and often necessitates an extensive analytical process.
Interpreting clustering results under DP is even more challenging, as analysts
are provided with noisy responses to queries, and longer, manual exploration
sessions require additional noise to meet privacy constraints. While increasing
attention has been given to clustering explanation frameworks that aim at
assisting analysts by automatically uncovering the characteristics of each
cluster, such frameworks may also disclose sensitive information within the
dataset, leading to a breach in privacy. To address these challenges, we
present DPClustX, a framework that provides explanations for black-box
clustering results while satisfying DP. DPClustX takes as input the sensitive
dataset alongside privately computed clustering labels, and outputs a global
explanation, emphasizing prominent characteristics of each cluster while
guaranteeing DP. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of DPClustX on
real data, showing that it provides insightful and accurate explanations even
under tight privacy constraints.

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有方法，能保持强大的隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法可让组织协作训练安全高效的大语言模型。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and
fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources
across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It
addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated
with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive
for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of
task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains
vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient
inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized
Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at
preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters,
enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the
attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore,
optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability
and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA
substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL
feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy
protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and
efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于图的二进制代码相似性分析方法在代码混淆下因控制流不稳定而性能下降。

Method: 开发基于支配增强语义图（DESG）的抗混淆二进制代码相似性分析模型ORCAS，DESG能捕捉更多无控制流结构的隐式语义。

Result: 在BinKit数据集上显著优于八个基线，使用三种混淆选项时平均PR - AUC增益12.1%；在真实世界混淆漏洞数据集上召回率最高提升43%。

Conclusion: ORCAS模型能有效应对代码混淆，提升二进制代码相似性分析性能。

Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a core technique for binary
analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection. While current graph-based BCSA
approaches capture substantial semantics and show strong performance, their
performance suffers under code obfuscation due to the unstable control flow. To
address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based
on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary
code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without
control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations, inter-basic
block relations, and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS robustly scores
semantic similarity across binary functions from different obfuscation options,
optimization levels, and instruction set architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BinKit dataset shows ORCAS significantly outperforms eight baselines,
achieving an average 12.1% PR-AUC gain when using combined three obfuscation
options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, ORCAS
improves recall by up to 43% on an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability
dataset, which we released to facilitate future research.

Result: 文中未提及具体研究结果。

Conclusion: 采用提出的研究优先级，红队研究才能充分应对AI快速发展带来的新威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

classifiers). This study investigates black-box adversarial attacks in computer
vision. This is a realistic scenario, where attackers have query-only access to
the target model. Three properties are introduced to evaluate attack
feasibility: robustness to compression, stealthiness to automatic detection,
and stealthiness to human inspection. State-of-the-Art methods tend to
prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between
the three properties.

### [212] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文从互信息差分隐私视角重新审视1位梯度压缩，提出FERRET方法，证明其隐私损失，实验表明该方法在隐私、效用和效率上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从互信息差分隐私视角改进1位梯度压缩，解决隐私、效用和性能的三难困境。

Method: 基于signSGD，提出FERRET方法，通过伯努利掩码每个参数组最多传输一个符号位。

Result: FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH在困惑度上优于DPSGD，MI - AUC表现与DPSGD相当，FERRET使用更少训练时间。

Conclusion: 基于符号的互信息差分隐私更接近实现隐私、效用和性能的平衡，FERRET能在无附加噪声下提供隐私保证。

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

Motivation: 现有针对BCSD模型的对抗攻击方法缺乏理论基础且处理复杂程序耗时，需改进以应对目标攻击场景。

Result: 与现有攻击方法相比，提出的攻击方法在几乎所有场景中攻击成功率更高，且提高了效率和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 真实案例表明提出的攻击方法有安全影响，需增强现有BCSD模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced
features and fine-tuning on an extensive and diverse dataset comprising a few
open-source and private collections, Sentinel achieves state-of-the-art
performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's
architecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a
thorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.

Method: 提出StealthInk水印方案，推导固定等错误率下水印检测所需的最少token数。

Result: 综合实验评估表明StealthInk具有隐蔽性、可检测性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StealthInk是大语言模型水印应用的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Conclusion: 揭示了大语言模型在安全代码生成方面的紧迫挑战，为未来改进提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged
as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior
research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated
code. In this work, we introduce \benchmark, a benchmark specifically designed
to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide
range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types.
Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that
leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging
to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code.
Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we
reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free
code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights
for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The
data and code will be released soon.

Result: 通过实验评估了PPA对现有攻击的防御效果，并与其他防御方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: PPA能以近乎零开销防御提示注入攻击，在不影响性能的情况下增强安全性。

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SeroneySun/LpLA_code.

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

Motivation: 现有联邦对抗训练（FAT）生成的通用全局模型难以处理客户端数据分布的多样性和异构性，训练中通信挑战大，需要个性化防御模型。

Method: Sylva分两阶段，第一阶段用LoRA进行本地对抗微调，上传LoRA参数降低通信成本；第二阶段引入基于博弈的层选择策略提高良性数据准确性。

Conclusion: Sylva能为每个客户端提供有效平衡鲁棒性和准确性的定制防御模型。

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统易受语料库中毒攻击，且现有攻击策略将检索和生成阶段分离，效果有限。

Method: 提出Joint - GCG框架，包含跨词汇投影、梯度标记对齐和自适应加权融合三项创新。

Result: 在多个检索器和生成器上，攻击成功率比先前方法最多高25%，平均高5%，生成的毒物对未见模型有可迁移性。

Conclusion: Joint - GCG统一检索和生成阶段基于梯度的攻击，重塑了对RAG系统漏洞的理解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at

Result: Stealix在相同查询预算下显著优于其他方法，包括可访问类名或细粒度提示的方法。

Conclusion: Stealix具有可扩展性，预训练生成模型在模型窃取中的风险可能比之前认识的更大。

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.

Method: 提出DHR算法的扩展EDHR，可将0 - 1背包问题实例化为至多$n^i$子实例，$i$可按需设置。

Result: 在随机生成的数据实例上进行计算实验，EDHR比CPLEX大幅减小搜索树规模。

Conclusion: EDHR算法在解决0 - 1背包问题上比CPLEX更有效，能减小搜索树规模。

Abstract: Dembo-Hammer's Reduction Algorithm (DHR) is one of the classical algorithms
for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem (0-1 KP) and its variants, which reduces an
instance of the 0-1 KP to a sub-instance of smaller size with reduction time
complexity $O(n)$. We present an extension of DHR (abbreviated as EDHR), which
reduces an instance of 0-1 KP to at most $n^i$ sub-instances for any positive
integer $i$. In practice, $i$ can be set as needed. In particular, if we choose
$i=1$ then EDHR is exactly DHR. Finally, computational experiments on randomly
generated data instances demonstrate that EDHR substantially reduces the search
tree size compared to CPLEX.

inefficiencies and rigidity of current models but also lays the groundwork for
scalable, generalizable artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

TL;DR: 本文扩展吸引子范式，用多阶段中间表示学习说话人属性，并用Conformer替换Transformer，在CALLHOME数据集上提升了说话人分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升端到端说话人分割方法性能，处理可变说话人数量并在训练时更好地引导网络。

Method: 扩展吸引子范式，用多阶段中间表示学习说话人属性；用Conformer（卷积增强的Transformer）替换Transformer以建模局部依赖。

Result: 在CALLHOME数据集上的说话人分割性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的扩展吸引子范式和架构改进方法有助于提升说话人分割性能。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出WhisQ多模态架构用于文本到音乐系统的MOS预测，在MusicEval Track - 1数据集上表现优于基线，消融实验显示最优传输正则化很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到音乐系统MOS预测中评估整体音乐质量和文本提示对齐的双重挑战。

Method: 采用Whisper Base预训练模型进行音频编码、Qwen 3进行文本编码，有专门预测路径，用Sinkhorn最优传输损失加强语义对齐。

Result: 在MusicEval Track - 1数据集上，整体音乐质量的Spearman相关性提高7%，文本对齐提高14%。

Conclusion: 最优传输正则化带来最大性能提升，显式跨模态对齐对文本到音乐评估很重要。

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

TL;DR: 开发零样本TTS语音印象控制方法，用低维向量表示语音印象对强度，评估证明其有效，可通过大模型生成向量实现目标印象生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本TTS虽有高说话人保真度，但调控副语言/非语言信息控制语音印象有挑战。

Method: 开发利用低维向量表示各种语音印象对强度的语音印象控制方法，通过大语言模型生成该向量。

Result: 客观和主观评估都证明了该方法在印象控制上的有效性。

Conclusion: 此方法有效，能通过大语言模型从自然语言描述生成目标印象，无需手动优化。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

TL;DR: 本文研究CTC隐含的上下文依赖，提出基于知识蒸馏的上下文依赖ILM估计方法及正则化方法，实验表明上下文依赖ILM在跨域评估中表现更好，标签级KD平滑方法表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CTC的ILM中隐含的上下文依赖。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏的上下文依赖ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法，在Librispeech和TED - LIUM Release 2数据集上进行实验。

Result: 上下文依赖ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文无关先验，标签级KD平滑方法比浅融合在词错误率上有超13%的相对提升。

Conclusion: CTC能学习上下文依赖的ILM，提出的标签级KD平滑方法是更优的ILM估计方法。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Motivation: 现有设计MAS方法依赖部署环境知识，在复杂低可读性环境中应用成本高或有安全问题。

Method: 结合多智能体强化学习过程和组织模型来提供相关组织规范。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 引入AOMEA可缓解MAS组织设计面临的问题。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

TL;DR: 提出FinanceReasoning基准评估大推理模型金融数值推理能力，有可信度、全面性和挑战性三方面改进，还展示结合模型可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大推理模型在金融数值推理问题上的推理能力，改进现有基准。

Method: 更新公开数据集问题，标注新问题并给出Python解决方案，细化评估标准；构建Python格式函数；设置难题让模型进行推理。

Result: FinanceReasoning在覆盖金融概念和公式上表现出色，构建函数提升了模型能力，结合模型能有效提升性能，最佳模型准确率达89.1%，但模型仍有数值精度挑战。

Conclusion: 为未来评估和改进大推理模型在特定领域复杂推理任务的研究奠定基础。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 端到端自动语音识别模型训练数据获取成本高，且对近期或不常见电影标题识别效果差。

Method: 构建语音校正系统，包括基于ASR模型输出的语音搜索生成语音替代项，以及结合识别结果和替代项选择最终输出的重评分组件。

Result: 在流行电影标题基准测试中，相对于一系列竞争基线，单词错误率降低4.4% - 7.6%。

Conclusion: 所提语音校正系统能有效提升电影标题的语音识别效果。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的临床文本生成方法在根据有限患者信息生成长格式记录方面不足。

Method: 提出R2AG，用强化学习从医学知识图中检索推理路径指导大语言模型；提出GRO以组相对奖励提高检索质量。

Result: 在MIMIC - IV - Note数据集上实验表明R2AG在临床有效性和自然语言生成指标上优于基线。

Conclusion: R2AG能填补稀疏输入场景的语义空白，检索的推理路径助大语言模型避免临床误解。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Motivation: 传统解码方法在文本生成中难以平衡流畅性、多样性和连贯性，需要改进。

Method: 提出Adaptive Semantic - Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)算法，结合动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖惩调整。

Result: 通过多基准测试，使用困惑度、MAUVE和多样性分数等指标评估，ASTS减少重复、增强语义对齐、提高流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS优于现有采样技术，能确保上下文连贯和多样化文本生成，且保持计算效率。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

Result: 在多个流行大语言模型实验中，SmoothRot在语言生成和零样本推理任务上持续缩小量化与FP16模型约10 - 30%的性能差距，且无额外推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot是一种有效的提升大语言模型4位量化效率的后训练量化技术。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe方法在个性化奖励建模方面表现出色，能有效提升大语言模型的个性化性能。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with

Result: Rel - LLM在关键RDL任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Rel - LLM是一种可扩展且高效的将大语言模型与结构化数据源集成的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for

verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出R2 - Reasoner框架，实现跨异构大语言模型协作推理，降低API成本且保持或超越基线准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理扩展推理链成本高，简单步骤可用小模型处理，但实现模型协作需准确任务分解和难度感知分配，此为难点。

Method: 提出R2 - Reasoner框架，核心是强化模型路由器，含任务分解器和子任务分配器；采用分阶段管道训练，结合监督微调与组相对策略优化算法。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准测试中，R2 - Reasoner降低API成本86.85%，保持或超越基线准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为更具成本效益和适应性的大语言模型推理铺平道路。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

Result: 实验表明异质MoA在性能和参数效率上优于同质MoE - LoRA方法。

Conclusion: 异质MoA方法是解决现有MoE - LoRA架构问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Conclusion: DynamicMind能有效提升大语言模型零样本问答性能与效率

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

Result: 开展大量实验验证框架有效性，数据和代码公开。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和机制可让LLMs生成更有效的情感支持回复。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解当前框架确定的三种AI危害，尤其针对电商场景。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

Motivation: 现有研究对大语言模型在动态图（现实世界演化网络）的应用探索不足，真实世界时间图应用仍是开放问题。

Method: 引入TGTalker框架，利用时间图中的近期偏差提取结构信息并转为自然语言供大语言模型使用，利用时间邻居信息进行预测。

Result: TGTalker在链路预测上与现有Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN)模型相比有竞争力，在五个真实网络中表现与现有方法相当，且持续优于TGN和HTGN等流行模型，还能为预测生成文本解释。

Conclusion: TGTalker为时间链路预测的可解释性和可解释性开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

Method: 提出Shoes - of - Others (SoO) prefixing方法，在大语言模型输出开始指定“Let's put ourselves in A's shoes.”。

Result: 在两个评估无世界状态变化的对话和叙事语境中心智理论的基准测试中，该方法在五类心理状态上持续提升心智理论表现。

Conclusion: SoO prefixing能引发真实想法，从而提高心智理论表现。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

Result: 评估指标准确率达89.2%，动态思维链减少超35%标记消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为思维链推理机制提供新视角，为其高效部署提供框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

Result: AvR显著优于传统偏好优化方法，仅用3k合成样本就让LLaMA - 3 - 8B - Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0胜率提升超20%。

Conclusion: AvR方法能有效解锁大语言模型通过长形式思维链进行递归推理的潜力。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SR - DCR是解决大语言模型参数知识与上下文输入冲突的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Motivation: 大语言模型依赖大规模专有数据集，存在版权侵权风险，且现有数据集推理方法依赖模型内部信息，而许多模型开始隐藏这些信息，因此需要不依赖模型内部信息的仅标签方法。

Method: 引入CatShift框架，利用灾难性遗忘现象，比较模型对可疑数据集和已知非成员验证集的输出变化，统计判断可疑数据集是否为原训练集。

Result: 在开源和基于API的大语言模型上的大量实验验证了CatShift在无法访问模型对数概率的情况下的有效性。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了一个强大且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

Conclusion: 强调需要强大的防御策略，为隐私保护联邦学习的未来研究提供新的基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Motivation: 传统诊断方法可能忽略细微发展模式，本研究旨在用无监督机器学习技术识别有和无SLI儿童的自然语言发展轨迹，为早期识别和干预提供依据。

Method: 对三个语料库中1163名4 - 16岁儿童的叙事样本进行主成分分析（PCA）和聚类分析，评估64个语言特征。

Result: 出现两个主要聚类，一是高语言产出且低SLI患病率，二是产出有限但句法复杂度高且高SLI患病率，边界情况呈现中间特征，支持语言能力连续体模型。

Conclusion: SLI主要通过降低产出能力而非句法复杂度缺陷体现，结果挑战了分类诊断框架，凸显无监督学习技术在完善诊断标准和干预策略方面的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的上下文词嵌入，并探究与格结构选择对语义解释的上下文影响。

Method: 引入semantic - features库，设计包含450对句子的数据集，使用该库研究三种掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入。

Result: 三种掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入显示出预期的敏感性。

Conclusion: 对semantic - features工具的实用性持乐观态度。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在开放式谜题推理场景的性能未被充分测试，需评估其逐步、开放式和创造性多模态推理能力。

Method: 创建包含667个谜题的PuzzleWorld基准，标注最终答案、推理过程和认知技能标签，测试模型并进行误差分析。

Result: 多数模型最终答案准确率仅1 - 2%，最佳模型解出14%谜题，逐步推理准确率40%；基于推理痕迹微调小模型可提升逐步推理准确率，仅训练最终答案会降低性能。

Conclusion: 当前模型存在短视推理、语言推理受限和缺乏绘图能力等问题，发布PuzzleWorld以支持构建更通用的推理系统。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in

Conclusion: 新数据集可助力研究语言模型的两种记忆过程，同时构建现实的虚构合成数据存在挑战。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型知识蒸馏方法在训练中难以防止学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘等问题。

Method: 提出POCL框架，含难度测量器和训练调度器，按从易到难顺序引入训练样本并调整损失函数温度。

Result: 在指令跟随设置实验中，POCL在多种白盒KD方法和模型族中提升了蒸馏学生模型的性能。

Conclusion: 排序训练样本在大语言模型知识蒸馏中有效，可在KD过程中结构化训练数据提升蒸馏大语言模型的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Result: 在新构建的基准上实验表明框架能更现实和严格评估遗忘性能，发现当前评估策略高估遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 所提知识遗忘评估框架有效，当前评估策略存在高估问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Motivation: 当前使用大语言模型结合上下文学习回答查询时，KV缓存内存消耗随输入长度增加，服务成本高，需探索替代方案。

Method: 提出self - study训练方法，通过生成关于语料库的合成对话，以上下文蒸馏目标训练Cartridge。

Result: Self - study训练的Cartridge复制了ICL的功能，在长上下文基准测试中，使用的内存少38.6倍，吞吐量高26.4倍，还能扩展模型有效上下文长度，且可在推理时组合使用。

Conclusion: Self - study训练的Cartridge是一种比ICL更具成本效益的处理长文本查询的方法。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Conclusion: 强调任务级条件对大语言模型生成代码检测的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

Conclusion: 该方法能将空间模式有效表示为相空间中的相关向量，为分类、预测、参数拟合和预报开辟了道路。

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing

first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and

Conclusion: TriPSS能捕捉细微视觉和语义信息，为大规模检索场景下的视频内容理解设定了新基准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Motivation: 现有检索系统将多模态视为独立检索源，会导致检索结果嘈杂、质量不佳，需要能动态选择模态的有效检索器。

Method: 引入CLaMR联合索引4种模态，用统一多模态骨干联合编码；构建大规模合成训练数据集MultiVENT 2.0++；提出模态感知损失进行联合训练。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上，CLaMR性能优于现有检索器；在长视频问答任务中，CLaMR比其他方法有性能提升。

Conclusion: CLaMR在多模态视频内容检索和长视频问答任务中具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,

motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the

vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Motivation: 生成式AI为艺术和文化遗产领域带来新视角，需创新以方便获取和突出数字藏品内容。

Method: 基于自主图像概念，使用开源大语言、人脸检测、文本转语音和音频转动画模型构建新框架。

Result: 可从数字化艺术品自动组装出主角动画解释内容的短视频。

Conclusion: 整个过程引发对大语言模型文化偏见、数字图像潜力、艺术作品深度伪造用于教育及艺术史领域相关担忧的思考。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中质量评分和推理描述任务分离的问题，提出统一的两阶段训练框架，实验表明模型表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述作为分离任务，存在权衡问题，阻碍了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出统一的两阶段训练框架，第一阶段通过专家设计提示从教师模型中提炼高质量数据，用交叉熵损失监督初始化推理能力；第二阶段引入新奖励和GRPO联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q - Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提高6.5%，在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效，模型具有在不同任务上的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

Result: 在多个VLMs上的广泛实验显示，该方法最大可降低57.58%的延迟，最大可提高44%的物体检测精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的AD - EE框架能有效解决VLMs在自动驾驶实时应用中的效率问题。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Motivation: 现有AV - LLMs和基准主要关注静态或2D场景，缺乏对动态视听环境中3D空间推理的研究。

Method: 提出SAVVY训练自由推理管道，包含以自我为中心的空间轨迹估计和动态全局地图构建两个阶段。

Result: SAVVY大幅提升了现有AV - LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: SAVVY为AV - LLMs中的动态3D空间推理设定了新标准和阶段。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Method: 设计Self - Predictive Dynamics (SPD)方法，并行使用弱和强增强，通过预测双向增强版本的反向和正向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和自动驾驶任务（CARLA）中，SPD在复杂观测中优于先前研究，显著提高了对未见观测的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法能有效提取任务相关特征，提升模型在复杂和未见观测下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Result: 在DeepMind Control套件和Robosuite的随机环境中，Dr. G分别比先前工作性能提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G方法能有效提升世界模型对视觉干扰的鲁棒性，增强MBRL的泛化性能。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Result: 该策略在视觉问答和视觉推理数据集上优于其他多模态和单模态攻击方法。

Conclusion: 该策略能有效削弱多个预训练多模态模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉表征能为语言解码器提供语义信息；视觉表征上下文减少时，语言解码器可补偿不足并恢复性能。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型中存在动态分工，建议未来架构将更多视觉处理任务交给语言解码器。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Result: FastDrive在结构化数据集上性能有竞争力，决策任务准确率提升约20%，推理速度比大参数基线快超10倍。

Conclusion: FastDrive能有效应对自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的问题，场景注释对决策任务很重要。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Result: 用先进模型实验发现各推理类别存在显著性能差距，抽象和规划任务差距尤其大。

Conclusion: MORSE - 500适合对下一代模型进行压力测试，开源资源可支持多模态推理研究。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Result: 与AI - CT标签对比，健康成人队列中位Dice系数0.79；专家手动标注验证中，健康个体中位Dice为0.83，肿瘤病例为0.81，优于先前方法；可接受性测试接受率89%，盲法对比审查表现出色。

Conclusion: TissUnet能快速、准确和可重复地分割颅外组织，支持相关大规模研究。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

TL;DR: 提出针对VLA模型的DriveAction基准，含大量QA对，实验表明VLMs需视觉和语言引导，评估能精准定位模型瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏场景多样性、可靠动作标注和符合人类偏好的评估协议，需改进。

Method: 引入DriveAction基准，利用真实驾驶数据，提供动作标签，采用树状评估框架。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在无视觉、语言或两者皆无输入时，动作预测准确率分别下降3.3%、4.1%和8.0%，评估结果稳健一致。

Conclusion: DriveAction为自动驾驶中类人决策的发展提供新见解和坚实基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 提出新颖且与模型无关的方法解决自动驾驶传感器融合中传感器陈旧问题，在同步和陈旧条件下都有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器陈旧问题导致传感器模态时间不对齐，影响目标状态估计和轨迹预测质量，影响自动驾驶感知系统性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出每点时间戳偏移特征实现细粒度时间感知，采用数据增强策略模拟实际传感器陈旧模式，并集成到多传感器视角检测模型。

Result: 传统模型在一个传感器模态陈旧时性能显著下降，而该方法在同步和陈旧条件下都能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决传感器融合中传感器陈旧问题。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出新多尺度特征融合方法改进 UNet 解码过程，实验展示其优势且代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UNet 家族的跳跃连接存在不同尺度特征缺乏有效交互、信息集成操作简单的局限，现有改进忽视这些问题。

Method: 将 UNet 解码过程视为求解初值问题，把跳跃连接作为离散节点，利用线性多步法原理提出自适应常微分方程方法实现多尺度特征融合，且该方法独立于编解码器架构。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上实验，展示出改进的特征利用、减少的网络参数和高性能。

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度特征融合方法能有效解决 UNet 跳跃连接的局限，具有良好适应性和性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Conclusion: 所提出的HMVLM框架及三项升级有效提升了驾驶性能。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public

*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出新指标RSS评估语义分割模型，发现半监督方法常牺牲可靠性换精度，倡导用更全面指标评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督语义分割评估协议只关注分割精度，忽略可靠性和鲁棒性，无法满足安全关键应用需求。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS) 指标，通过调和平均结合预测准确性、校准和不确定性质量度量。

Result: 综合评估显示半监督方法常牺牲可靠性换精度，UniMatchV2有鲁棒性但可靠性有不足。

Conclusion: 倡导评估协议向更全面的指标如RSS转变，以更好契合实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

TL;DR: 本文提出无训练视频编辑方法FADE，利用预训练视频扩散模型先验进行高效编辑，实验效果良好。


<details>

Motivation: 传统图像扩散模型处理视频动态不足，现有视频扩散模型难以高效编辑。

Method: 引入FADE，通过频率感知分解利用预训练模型先验，分析注意力模式，提出分解策略，设计频谱引导调制。

Result: 在真实视频上的实验表明，方法能在质量和数量上实现高质量、逼真且时间连贯的编辑结果。

Conclusion: FADE是一种有效的无训练视频编辑方法，可高效、灵活编辑视频。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的文本到运动生成在高保真、流式能力、实时响应和可扩展性上存在挑战。

Method: 提出MOGO框架，含MoSA - VQ模块对运动序列分层离散化，RQHC - Transformer单步生成多层运动令牌，还引入文本条件对齐机制。

Result: 在HumanML3D等基准数据集上实验，MOGO生成质量有竞争力或更优，实时性能、流式生成和零样本泛化能力提升。

Conclusion: MOGO框架能有效解决现有挑战，实现高效实时3D运动生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出对象级自蒸馏（ODIS）方法，将自蒸馏粒度从图像转移到对象，提升视觉表征效果，在 ImageNet1k 上有高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法依赖以对象为中心的数据集进行图像级自蒸馏，假设每张图像含单个对象，该假设不总是成立且限制了对场景中心数据集的扩展性。

Method: 引入 ODIS 方法，使用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力，将场景级任务转化为对象级子任务。

Result: 该方法在图像和 patch 级别改善了视觉表征，使用掩码在推理时，在 ImageNet1k 上用 ViT - Large 达到 82.6% 的 k - NN 准确率。

Conclusion: ODIS 方法有效，能提升视觉预训练效果。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Conclusion: 微调基础模型获取动力学模型相对容易，且动力学模型能有效引导世界模型，提升图像编辑性能。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Method: 提出含AutoKL Adapter和CLIP Adapter的HAVIR模型，通过Versatile Diffusion融合两种适配器表示生成重建图像，用文本描述和合成语义图像训练CLIP Adapter。

Result: HAVIR能有效重建复杂场景中视觉刺激的结构特征和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR在重建复杂视觉信息方面表现出色，具有有效性。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Conclusion: 本文建立了新任务、数据集和有效生成式检索方法，为该方向未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: 当前AI视觉模型存在根本局限，VGA为实现类人概念化提供框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPT是诊断吸入性过敏致敏的金标准，SPAT设备设计用于提高测试结果一致性，需设计自动检测和描绘风团的方法。

Method: 使用868名疑似吸入性过敏患者的SPAT数据，手动标注10416个风团，方法分两部分：神经网络进行像素级分割，算法方法检测和描绘风团。

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上评估方法性能，以单张传统光照SPT图像为基线。

Conclusion: 使用32张不同光照条件的SPAT图像比单张传统均匀光照图像有更高准确性。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

TL;DR: 本文发现扩散净化方法中每个样本的最优噪声水平不同，提出SSNI框架根据样本偏离干净数据分布的程度自适应调整噪声水平，结合现有方法在CIFAR - 10和ImageNet - 1K上提升了准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散净化方法对所有样本使用恒定噪声水平，而实际上每个样本的最优噪声水平可能不同，干净样本应注入更少噪声。

Method: 提出Sample - specific Score - aware Noise Injection (SSNI)框架，用预训练得分网络估计数据点偏离干净数据分布的程度（得分范数），基于得分范数用重加权函数自适应调整每个样本的噪声水平。

Result: 将SSNI框架与现有扩散净化方法结合，在CIFAR - 10和ImageNet - 1K上显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 扩散净化方法中有必要为不同样本分配不同的噪声水平。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习中图像或高阶张量数据普遍，其高维特性使次二次层处理此类数据需求更迫切。

Method: 利用‘角树’提出线性成本的张量到张量层，构建FIS层并与其他层集成。

Result: 在分类任务中，用FIS替换小ResNet部分层，与大ResNet精度相近且减少参数和运算；异常检测中，在MVTec AD数据集上平均AUROC达97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层在处理高维张量数据的分类和异常检测任务中有效且可用，代码公开。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

Motivation: 当前基于CNN的红外小目标检测方法忽视深浅层特征异质性，未系统建模不同特征层次的依赖关系和融合机制，导致检测性能受限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出SDS - Net网络，采用双分支架构分别建模特征结构和语义特性，引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Conclusion: SDS - Net在红外小目标检测任务中具有优越的检测性能和广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Method: 构建H2Crop数据集，提出双流Transformer架构，包含光谱空间Transformer和时间Swin Transformer，设计分层分类头。

Conclusion: H2Crop数据集为细粒度农业作物分类和高光谱图像处理建立重要基准，所提方法有效且高光谱数据有益。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Result: 实验显示现有开放和封闭的最先进模型表现远不及人类。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型缺乏人类保留和推理关键叙事信息的能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

Result: 证明了网络在不同时间尺度下的收敛性，给出全局最小值表达式，结果得到数值实验支持。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，可用于主子空间投影。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic

Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding
of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We
examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking
pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address
these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI普及，需为老年人提供知识以理解其利弊，老年人采用新兴技术更谨慎，需针对性素养支持。

Method: 采用混合研究方法，通过聊天机器人Litti向老年人提供生成式AI素养教育，并评估其对老年人AI素养的影响。

Result: 定量数据显示AI素养有提升趋势但不显著，定性访谈显示老年人对生成式AI熟悉程度不同且有强烈学习意愿，Litti提供积极学习体验，但未显著提升信任和安全感。

Conclusion: 本探索性案例研究凸显了为老年人群设计AI素养教育的挑战与机遇。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

Motivation: 研究观察小部分图像像素预测未观察部分，提升图像重建质量。

Method: 提出适用于实值和彩色图像的卷积神经自回归分布估计器（ConvNADE）模型的广义高效版本，研究随机和低差异像素块观察时的图像重建质量。

Result: 在基准数据集实验显示，选择类似低差异序列的像素可降低测试损失，生成更真实的重建图像。

Conclusion: 选择类似低差异序列的像素对图像重建有积极效果。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,

Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类任务中因单向特征传递和缺乏上下文信息关联方法而效果不佳，且胎儿超声图像存在低对比度、高相似性和高噪声问题。

Method: 提出FPDANet，设计位置注意力机制（DAN）模块增强特征表示，设计双边多尺度（FPAN）信息融合模块捕获不同特征尺度的上下文和全局特征依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top - 1和Top - 5指标分别达到91.05%和100%。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了FPDANet的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

Motivation: 肺部肿瘤体积分割在放疗、手术及化疗评估中有重要作用，但目前缺少自动或半自动的纵向肿瘤分割方案。

Method: 放射科医生提供肿瘤初始位置，LinGuinE采样肿瘤内点，通过刚性配准传播到其他时间点，用点击有效性分类器选择仍在肿瘤内的点，自动创建新时间点的分割。

Result: 在两个测试集上，63项纵向研究中LinGuinE使Dice系数提高超20%（p< 0.05），任意时间点都可作起点，消融实验表明其设置效果最佳。

Conclusion: LinGuinE在肺部肿瘤纵向分割中效果良好。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Motivation: 传统训练算法训练BiNNs存在局限，量子超网络为优化BiNNs提供新范式。

Method: 使用变分量子算法通过量子电路测量生成二值权重，推导ELBO，针对不同分布情况分别处理，对隐式分布引入基于MMD的替代ELBO。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法优于标准最大似然估计（MLE）。

Conclusion: 所提方法能提高BiNNs的可训练性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Result: 提出了关于可证明概率安全的三个核心问题，为理论安全保障和实际部署之间架起桥梁。

Conclusion: 研究为具身AI系统在安全关键应用中的更安全、大规模采用提供了途径。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

Result: 能够在低维数据空间中通过少量解释的运行模式总结大量历史数据库，显示各情况下涉及的变量和设施单元。

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Conclusion: Pegasus能解决现有数据平面深度学习推理的局限，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

Abstract: High-quality mobility data remains scarce despite growing interest from
researchers and urban stakeholders in understanding individual-level movement
patterns. The Netmob25 Data Challenge addresses this gap by releasing a unique
GPS-based mobility dataset derived from the EMG 2023 GNSS-based mobility survey
conducted in the Ile-de-France region (Greater Paris area), France. This
dataset captures detailed daily mobility over a full week for 3,337 volunteer
residents aged 16 to 80, collected between October 2022 and May 2023. Each
participant was equipped with a dedicated GPS tracking device configured to
record location points every 2-3 seconds and was asked to maintain a digital or
paper logbook of their trips. All inferred mobility traces were algorithmically
processed and validated through follow-up phone interviews.
  The dataset includes three components: (i) an Individuals database describing
demographic, socioeconomic, and household characteristics; (ii) a Trips
database with over 80,000 annotated displacements including timestamps,
transport modes, and trip purposes; and (iii) a Raw GPS Traces database
comprising about 500 million high-frequency points. A statistical weighting
mechanism is provided to support population-level estimates. An extensive
anonymization pipeline was applied to the GPS traces to ensure GDPR compliance
while preserving analytical value. Access to the dataset requires acceptance of
the challenge's Terms and Conditions and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
This paper describes the survey design, collection protocol, processing
methodology, and characteristics of the released dataset.

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust
and dynamic information

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网上教育材料相互脱节、存在平台壁垒的问题。

Method: 以组织和广泛教学原则为起点，提出Curriculum KG Ontology框架，并为原型开放知识网络用例提供物化图。

Result: 为原型开放知识网络用例提供了物化图，并通过领域专家和教育工作者的能力问题进行验证。

Conclusion: Curriculum KG Ontology框架可用于实现教育材料的密集互连。

Abstract: Educational, learning, and training materials have become extremely
commonplace across the Internet. Yet, they frequently remain disconnected from
each other, fall into platform silos, and so on. One way to overcome this is to
provide a mechanism to integrate the material and provide cross-links across
topics.
  In this paper, we present the Curriculum KG Ontology, which we use as a
framework for the dense interlinking of educational materials, by first
starting with organizational and broad pedagogical principles. We provide a
materialized graph for the Prototype Open Knowledge Network use-case, and
validate it using competency questions sourced from domain experts and
educators.

<details>

Motivation: 现有教育解决方案依赖云端或专有工具，成本高且有隐私问题，有预算限制的行业需要经济实惠的自托管解决方案。

Method: 引入端到端开源框架，利用小参数本地部署大语言模型，结合交互式循环和辅助验证器，采用RAG/CAG技术。

Conclusion: 精心设计的小语言模型系统能为教育工作者提供强大、经济、实用且安全的支持，在特定任务上可达到与大模型相当的效用。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an
evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that
carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical,
and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for
targeted tasks.

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

Motivation: 为提高深度学习模型在识别新行星候选体时的鲁棒性，需利用不同凌星调查数据的互补性。

Method: 提出卷积神经网络DART - Vetter，处理折叠在相对信号周期上的光变曲线，并在公开的TESS和Kepler光变曲线数据集上训练和测试。

Result: DART - Vetter在TESS和Kepler数据上召回率达91%，与Exominer和Astronet - Triage相比有竞争力。

Conclusion: DART - Vetter架构紧凑、开源且易复制，是自动化筛选或辅助人工审查的有用工具，在特定条件下有一定泛化能力。

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

Motivation: 探究银行倒闭的原因。

Method: 创建涵盖1863年至2024年美国大多数商业银行的面板数据进行研究。

Result: 倒闭银行有资产损失上升、偿付能力恶化等特征，可用会计指标预测倒闭；有挤兑的倒闭与基本面弱相关；失败银行资产回收率低。

Conclusion: 银行倒闭和银行危机的主要原因几乎总是银行基本面的恶化。

Abstract: Why do banks fail? We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1863
through 2024 to study the history of failing banks in the United States.
Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency,
and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. These commonalities
imply that bank failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics
from publicly available financial statements. Failures with runs were common
before deposit insurance, but these failures are strongly related to weak
fundamentals, casting doubt on the importance of non-fundamental runs.
Furthermore, low recovery rates on failed banks' assets suggest that most
failed banks were fundamentally insolvent, barring strong assumptions about the
value destruction of receiverships. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the
primary cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and
everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals.

Motivation: 野外活动输入数据缺乏导致计算机视觉任务性能低，尤其在体育等领域，现有合成数据集多样性有限。

Method: 引入Gen4D，集成专家驱动运动编码、基于扩散的高斯 splatting 提示引导头像生成和人感知背景合成；构建SportPAL数据集。

Result: Gen4D能生成多样且逼真的人类序列，SportPAL是涵盖三项运动的大规模合成数据集。

Conclusion: Gen4D和SportPAL为野外以人为中心的视觉任务构建合成数据集提供了可扩展基础，无需手动3D建模和场景设计。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their
characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By
examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene
authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to
how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current
models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for
assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into
their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive

research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced
generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high
computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like
cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the
quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation
metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统在预测未来时表现不佳，只能较好地进行插值，需要一种方法实现动态3D场景长期预测。

Method: 先学习高保真、时间条件变形模型并冻结，再训练Transformer编码器将过去高斯轨迹总结为潜在状态，由神经ODE控制其连续演化，通过数值积分得到高斯轨迹。

Result: 在D - NeRF和NVFI基准测试中达到SOTA，PSNR提升达10 dB，感知误差LPIPS减半。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景真实感预测的强大实用途径。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency
of LE-FALC with acyclic TBoxes by unraveling.

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to

neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Conclusion: PyGemini 为未来海上机器人与自主研究提供可扩展、可维护和高性能基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs)
requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation,
testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current
landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on
disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system
integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the
creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory
bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance
bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration
workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively
licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini
to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel
Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support
modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework
functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded
library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We
demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D
content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for
autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence
pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable,
and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy
research.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效实现轮腿机器人摔倒自适应恢复，无需特定平台调优。

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效提高零样本对象导航的成功率和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

extraction, coordinate transformation, area decomposition and path generation
using our novel AdaptiveDecompositionCPP algorithm, preview and customization
through an interactive coverage path visualizer, and conversion to actionable
GPS waypoints. The AdaptiveDecompositionCPP algorithm combines cellular
decomposition with an adaptive merging strategy to reduce non-mowing travel
thereby enhancing operational efficiency. Experimental evaluations,
encompassing both simulations and real-world lawnmower tests, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the framework in coverage completeness and mowing efficiency.

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于向量量化或字节对编码的动作分词器有局限，需要一种无需单独训练、能生成统一长度标记且可保证轨迹平滑的动作分词器。

Method: 提出B - spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST)，将其与三种不同模型架构集成，在多个基准和机器人设置上进行评估。

Result: 显著降低训练和推理计算成本，生成适合连续控制任务的平滑高频控制信号，取得与现有先进方法有竞争力的任务成功率。

Conclusion: BEAST具有与大型预训练模型的兼容性和可扩展性，在计算成本、信号生成和任务成功率方面表现良好。

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合作自主机器人系统在复杂多任务执行中需快速任务内适应，现有强化学习方法存在不足，需要新方法提升其弹性。

Method: 将合作任务重规划问题定义为多旅行商问题的新变种，开发基于图注意力网络和注意力模型的编码器/解码器模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为提高自主多智能体系统的弹性铺平了道路。

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 基于半定技术得出关于在线Frank - Wolfe算法后悔界等方面的结论。

Abstract: This work studies and develop projection-free algorithms for online learning
with linear optimization oracles (a.k.a. Frank-Wolfe) for handling the
constraint set. More precisely, this work (i) provides an improved (optimized)
variant of an online Frank-Wolfe algorithm along with its conceptually simple
potential-based proof, and (ii) shows how to leverage semidefinite programming
to jointly design and analyze online Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms numerically in
a variety of settings-that include the design of the variant (i). Based on the
semidefinite technique, we conclude with strong numerical evidence suggesting
that no pure online Frank-Wolfe algorithm within our model class can have a
regret guarantee better than O(T^3/4) (T is the time horizon) without
additional assumptions, that the current algorithms do not have optimal
constants, that the algorithm benefits from similar anytime properties O(t^3/4)
not requiring to know T in advance, and that multiple linear optimization
rounds do not generally help to obtain better regret bounds.

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

Conclusion: 该方法相比标准蒙特卡罗方法，能为任意系统输出严格上下界，无需先验分析收敛速度。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

Conclusion: ScaleRTL能有效解决RTL代码生成中的数据瓶颈和测试时缩放问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.
