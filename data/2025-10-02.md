### [1] [Learning to Lead Themselves: Agentic AI in MAS using MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00022)
*Ansh Kamthan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨自主智能体如何改进多智能体系统的任务分配与协调，采用轻量级多智能体近端策略优化方法实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主系统从原型走向实际部署，多智能体进行分散合作决策的能力成为核心需求，需研究如何改进多智能体系统任务分配与协调。

Method: 在合作多智能体强化学习环境中构建问题，在集中训练、分散执行范式下用PyTorch实现轻量级多智能体近端策略优化（IPPO）方法。

Result: 在PettingZoo环境中进行实验，多个同质无人机或智能体可在无明确通信下自组织覆盖不同目标。

Conclusion: 未明确提及结论，但暗示了所提方法在多智能体系统任务分配与协调上可能有效。

Abstract: As autonomous systems move from prototypes to real deployments, the ability
of multiple agents to make decentralized, cooperative decisions becomes a core
requirement. This paper examines how agentic artificial intelligence, agents
that act independently, adaptively and proactively can improve task allocation
and coordination in multi-agent systems, with primary emphasis on drone
delivery and secondary relevance to warehouse automation. We formulate the
problem in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning setting and
implement a lightweight multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization, called IPPO,
approach in PyTorch under a centralized-training, decentralized-execution
paradigm. Experiments are conducted in PettingZoo environment, where multiple
homogeneous drones or agents must self-organize to cover distinct targets
without explicit communication.

### [2] [Improving Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump Detection through Ensemble-Based Models and Synthetic Oversampling Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00836)
*Jieun Yu,Minjung Park,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究运用SMOTE和集成学习模型检测加密货币市场P&D操纵，实验表明方法有效，XGBoost和LightGBM表现佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场P&D事件稀缺导致类别不平衡，阻碍准确检测，需解决此问题。

Method: 应用SMOTE技术，并评估先进的集成学习模型区分操纵性交易和正常市场活动。

Result: 应用SMOTE增强模型检测能力，XGBoost和LightGBM召回率高，F1分数好，计算性能快。

Conclusion: 数据平衡技术与集成方法结合可显著提高操纵活动的早期检测，有助于创建更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

### [3] [ToolBrain: A Flexible Reinforcement Learning Framework for Agentic Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00023)
*Quy Minh Le,Minh Sao Khue Luu,Khanh-Tung Tran,Duc-Hai Nguyen,Hoang-Quoc-Viet Pham,Quan Le,Hoang Thanh Lam,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ToolBrain框架，支持多种训练策略，有诸多实用功能，通过用例展示其在提升工具使用技能上效果好且代码简单可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练代理使用工具存在手动设计奖励、训练数据有限、多工具选择差等问题，导致适应慢、资源浪费和性能不佳，需解决这些问题。

Method: 引入ToolBrain框架，支持多种训练策略，可自定义奖励或用LLM作为评判系统生成奖励，具备知识蒸馏、自动任务生成等能力。

Result: 通过训练CodeAct代理执行邮件搜索任务等用例，工具使用技能有快速、有针对性的提升（最高30.0%），代码库简单可扩展。

Conclusion: ToolBrain框架能有效解决训练代理使用工具的难题，可促进基于大语言模型的代理适应特定领域，框架已公开。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at
https://toolbrain.org.

### [4] [ARS: Adaptive Reasoning Suppression for Efficient Large Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00071)
*Dongqi Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)方法，可动态抑制冗余推理步骤，在多基准测试中实现了令牌、延迟和能耗的显著降低，同时保持或提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理语言模型存在计算效率低问题，现有高效推理方法难以平衡推理质量和推理成本。

Method: 提出无需训练的Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)方法，引入多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进式抑制阈值。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，实现了高达53%、46.1%和57.9%的令牌、延迟和能耗降低，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS方法能有效降低计算成本，同时保证推理质量。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

*Fabian Kovac,Sebastian Neumaier,Timea Pahi,Torsten Priebe,Rafael Rodrigues,Dimitrios Christodoulou,Maxime Cordy,Sylvain Kubler,Ali Kordia,Georgios Pitsiladis,John Soldatos,Petros Zervoudakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 人工智能影响欧洲社会经济，但带来伦理、法律和监管挑战，CERTAIN项目开发框架应对，本文介绍构建框架核心组件方法，通过试点验证推进合规与负责任创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能在欧洲发展过程中带来的伦理、法律和监管挑战。

Method: 提出语义机器学习运营（MLOps）用于结构化AI生命周期管理、本体驱动的数据谱系跟踪确保可追溯性和问责制、监管运营（RegOps）工作流实现合规要求。

Result: 未提及具体结果，目标是通过在不同试点中实施和验证解决方案来推进监管合规。

Conclusion: CERTAIN项目旨在推进监管合规，促进符合欧洲标准的负责任AI创新。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has rapidly become a cornerstone technology,
significantly influencing Europe's societal and economic landscapes. However,
the proliferation of AI also raises critical ethical, legal, and regulatory
challenges. The CERTAIN (Certification for Ethical and Regulatory Transparency
in Artificial Intelligence) project addresses these issues by developing a
comprehensive framework that integrates regulatory compliance, ethical
standards, and transparency into AI systems. In this position paper, we outline
the methodological steps for building the core components of this framework.
Specifically, we present: (i) semantic Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for
structured AI lifecycle management, (ii) ontology-driven data lineage tracking
to ensure traceability and accountability, and (iii) regulatory operations
(RegOps) workflows to operationalize compliance requirements. By implementing
and validating its solutions across diverse pilots, CERTAIN aims to advance
regulatory compliance and to promote responsible AI innovation aligned with
European standards.

### [6] [NeurIPS should lead scientific consensus on AI policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00075)
*Rishi Bommasani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文认为NeurIPS应积极促进AI政策的科学共识形成，并建议借鉴IPCC经验开展试点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计明智的AI政策需要严格证据和科学共识，但目前共识形成机制缺失。

Method: 提出NeurIPS是促进AI政策科学共识的最佳选择，并建议借鉴IPCC经验开展初始试点，还反驳了常见反对观点。

Result: 无明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: NeurIPS在多方面引领AI，应倡导科学共识以制定更高质量的AI政策。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

### [7] [When Hallucination Costs Millions: Benchmarking AI Agents in High-Stakes Adversarial Financial Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00332)
*Zeshi Dai,Zimo Peng,Zerui Cheng,Ryan Yihe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CAIA基准，揭示AI评估盲点，评估17个模型，发现能力差距、工具选择问题等，发布CAIA并强调对抗鲁棒性重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法评估模型在对抗性、高风险环境中的能力，现实部署需要模型具备抗欺骗能力。

Method: 以加密市场为测试平台，对17个模型进行178个时间锚定任务评估。

Result: 无工具时模型准确率仅28%，工具增强后最高67.4%，低于人类基线；模型存在工具选择问题，Pass@k指标掩盖危险行为。

Conclusion: 当前模型虽推理得分高，但在有主动对抗的环境中仍未做好准备，对抗鲁棒性是可信AI自主的必要条件。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

### [8] [A Neuro-Fuzzy System for Interpretable Long-Term Stock Market Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00960)
*Miha Ožbot,Igor Škrjanc,Vitomir Štruc*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Fuzzy Transformer（Fuzzformer）用于多元股票市场数据长期时间序列预测，性能与传统模型相当且有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多元时间序列预测中实现准确性和可解释性是重大挑战，本文旨在解决此问题。

Method: 结合多头自注意力和模糊推理系统的新型循环神经网络架构Fuzzformer，利用LSTM网络和时间注意力将多元数据浓缩为适合模糊推理系统的可解释特征。

Result: 在标准普尔500指数上测试，有可解释性预测潜力，也发现当前性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有实际应用价值，可用于理解和预测股票市场行为。

Abstract: In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving
both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network
architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference
systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time
series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention
to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy
inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting
performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing
meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the
real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for
interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs,
suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market
behavior.

### [9] [Judging by Appearances? Auditing and Intervening Vision-Language Models for Bail Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00088)
*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文审计了独立大视觉语言模型在保释决策预测任务中的效率，发现表现不佳，设计干预算法提升了性能，为未来设计智能干预奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大视觉语言模型增多，法律判决预测系统可利用罪犯图像，但可能有不良后果，因此研究其在保释决策预测任务中的效率。

Method: 先审计独立大视觉语言模型在保释决策预测任务中的效率，再通过RAG管道引入法律先例并使用创新方案微调模型来设计干预算法。

Result: 独立大视觉语言模型在多个交叉群体和模型中的表现较差，错误地拒绝给予应获保释者保释；设计的干预算法显著提高了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 为未来在大视觉语言模型部署于现实法律判决预测之前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

*Songran Bai,Bingzhe Wu,Yiwei Zhang,Chengke Wu,Xiaolong Zheng,Yaze Yuan,Ke Wu,Jianqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出审计领域专业知识增强的多智能体推理框架AuditAgent用于金融欺诈检测，实验表明其优于通用智能体范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中金融欺诈检测因证据隐蔽分散面临挑战，需要有效方法进行检测。

Method: 引入AuditAgent框架，利用专家标注数据集，整合主体级风险先验、混合检索策略和专业智能体模块。

Result: 方法在召回率和可解释性上大幅优于通用智能体范式，为自动化透明金融取证建立新基准。

Conclusion: 领域特定推理和数据集构建对实际监管应用中推进稳健金融欺诈检测有重要价值。

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 传统无人机应对突发事件方法有局限，体现式AI可实时评估并行动，在模拟场景验证其能实现新决策管道，提升自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法应对无人机应对突发事件时的大量现实意外情况，需要新方案。

Method: 利用体现式AI和大视觉语言模型进行常识推理，在虚幻引擎模拟城市基准测试中验证。

Result: 体现式AI使以前无法手动设计的自适应恢复和决策管道成为可能。

Conclusion: 体现式AI能提升自主航空系统的恢复能力和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

*Gabriel de Olim Gaul,Adam Gould,Avinash Kori,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出用于图像分类的神经符号管道SAA - CBR，探索其与神经组件的集成，在CLEVR - Hans数据集上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建有效的图像分类神经符号管道，结合对象中心学习与基于案例推理的符号推理。

Method: 提出SAA - CBR，探索AA - CBR与神经组件的多种集成方式，如特征组合、案例库缩减、部分排序、多类分类策略等。

Result: SAA - CBR在CLEVR - Hans数据集上是有效的分类器，性能与基线模型有竞争力。

Conclusion: SAA - CBR是一种有效的图像分类方法。

Abstract: We introduce Slot Attention Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (SAA-CBR),
a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline for image classification that integrates
object-centric learning via a neural Slot Attention (SA) component with
symbolic reasoning conducted by Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(AA-CBR). We explore novel integrations of AA-CBR with the neural component,
including feature combination strategies, casebase reduction via representative
samples, novel count-based partial orders, a One-Vs-Rest strategy for extending
AA-CBR to multi-class classification, and an application of Supported AA-CBR, a
bipolar variant of AA-CBR. We demonstrate that SAA-CBR is an effective
classifier on the CLEVR-Hans datasets, showing competitive performance against
baseline models.

### [13] [Thinkquel: A Model Dedicated to Text-to-dbt Using Synthetic Data and a Span-Aware Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00186)
*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍Thinkquel模型用于生成数据库查询，在测试集有良好表现，在Spider实验提升训练稳定性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转化为可靠的数据转换具有挑战，包括模式链接、方言适配、数据收集成本高和训练信号不匹配等问题。

Method: Thinkquel集成新合成数据管道TS - SQL和Token - Sequence GRPO (TS - GRPO)，使用两阶段SFT课程微调大语言模型。

Result: 在500 - example TS - SQL测试集上，Thinkquel (32B)执行成功率达93.2%，精确结果匹配率61.8%；在Spider (14B)实验中，TS - GRPO提升训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Conclusion: Thinkquel能生成健壮、可移植和可执行验证的数据库查询，TS - GRPO有效解决训练信号不匹配问题。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 研究提出解耦微调方法和DualTune推理框架提升本地大语言模型工具调用能力，实验表明可显著提高工具调用准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型任务自动化需隐私保护和低成本的本地推理，但本地模型在工具调用场景表现不佳。

Method: 将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成子任务，提出解耦微调方法创建LoRA适配器，构建DualTune推理框架动态加载适配器生成工具调用并实现分层编排。

Result: 在MCP - Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen - 2.5 - 7B模型工具调用准确率提升46%，优于同尺寸和两倍大小的其他模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调方法和DualTune推理框架能有效提升本地大语言模型在工具调用场景的性能。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用社交媒体平台数据进行抑郁严重程度检测，以应对心理健康评估需求。

Method: 提出AttentionDep模型，对帖子进行分层编码，通过注意力机制突出关键标记，结合心理健康知识图谱的领域知识，使用序数回归框架预测抑郁严重程度。

Result: AttentionDep在各数据集上分级F1分数比现有基线模型高5%以上，并能为预测提供可解释见解。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了基于社交媒体的心理健康评估中可信且透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法在计算成本、探索覆盖和多智能体适应方面存在局限，需解决深度强化学习智能体决策过程理解的挑战。

Method: 提出MAGIC - MASK框架，集成近端策略优化、自适应epsilon - 贪心探索和轻量级智能体间协作，基于轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化统一数学形式。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中，MAGIC - MASK在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性上优于现有基线，能提供可解释和可迁移的解释。

Conclusion: MAGIC - MASK框架能有效解决现有可解释性方法的局限，可从单智能体推广到多智能体系统。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

TL;DR: 研究ICL指南对跨领域认知能力的影响，发现存在效率与推理灵活性的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究ICL指南对跨领域认知能力的影响，此前该影响未被探索。

Method: 使用GPT - OSS:20b模型的六个变体（一个基线模型和五个ICL配置），进行840项测试，用ANOVA进行统计分析。

Result: ICL变体有显著行为改变，在常识任务上准确率91% - 99%，复杂推理问题上性能下降，奥数问题不受ICL优化影响。

Conclusion: ICL指南在效率和推理灵活性之间存在系统权衡，对大语言模型部署和AI安全有重要意义。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文引入基准评估大语言模型代理工具选择偏差，测试发现存在不公平现象，研究了偏差来源并提出缓解方法，指出偏差是公平部署工具增强大语言模型的关键障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代理在选择外部工具时可能存在系统偏差，影响用户体验和市场竞争公平性，因此需要评估和研究这种偏差。

Method: 引入包含多种功能等效工具的基准评估工具选择偏差，对七个模型进行测试；通过控制实验研究偏差来源；提出过滤候选工具并均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 模型存在工具选择不公平现象，语义对齐是选择的最强预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，预训练暴露会放大偏差；提出的缓解方法可减少偏差并保持良好的任务覆盖。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏差是公平部署工具增强大语言模型的关键障碍。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断面临数据稀缺、隐私问题和边缘设备资源有限等挑战。

Method: 提出AFFR框架，集成少样本联邦优化与元学习、能量感知客户端调度、带校准差分隐私的安全聚合。

Result: 在模拟数据集上，与基线FL相比精度提高达10%，减少超50%客户端退出且不影响收敛，隐私-效用权衡在临床可接受范围。

Conclusion: AFFR是公平且可信的罕见病联邦诊断实用途径。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers在逻辑推理方面存在困难，Hierarchical Reasoning Model虽有成果但尚处早期，需深入研究。

Method: 对Hierarchical Reasoning Model进行批判性回顾，研究关键设计选择并提出变体模型。

Result: 提出的变体模型在Sudoku - Extreme和Maze - Hard任务上比之前表现显著更好，还有意外发现。

Conclusion: 研究提出的变体有更好表现，同时为进一步研究提供了有趣方向。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从静态、手动策划的基准到动态、自我进化的评估系统的范式转变，为智能体发展提供可持续且有挑战性的途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI自由文本回应的黄金标准（人工专家评审）劳动强度大、速度慢，自动化指标与人类判断一致性不一且常依赖上下文，需解决自动化评估AI回应患者住院相关问题的可行性。

Method: 针对100个患者案例，收集28个AI系统的回应（共2800个），从是否回答问题、是否恰当使用临床记录证据、是否运用一般医学知识三个维度进行评估，并使用临床医生撰写的参考答案来校准指标。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评级高度匹配。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可扩大AI系统比较评估规模并支持医患沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何从数据构建球员级代理模型，使其学习的值和策略在战术上可解释且在不同数据源上稳健的问题。

Method: 提出EDMS，用关系变量增强原始位置和速度，结合动作掩码方案，让有球和无球代理有不同决策集。

Result: EDMS降低了动作预测损失和时间差分误差，突出高风险高回报战术模式，且集成到开源库，兼容多数据集。

Conclusion: EDMS在构建球员级代理模型上有效，能实现战术解释和跨数据源的稳健性，可进行跨供应商评估和可重复实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 以往工作认为过程奖励模型优于结果奖励模型的观点主要基于狭窄的数学相关领域，需要在更多领域统一评估。

Method: 对四种奖励模型变体（判别式结果和过程奖励模型、生成式结果和过程奖励模型）在14个不同领域进行评估。

Result: 判别式结果奖励模型与判别式过程奖励模型表现相当；生成式过程奖励模型竞争力不足；生成式结果奖励模型最稳健。

Conclusion: 挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的假设，支持生成式结果验证用于多领域部署，并公开代码等资源以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，为解锁新应用和学习实体级信息，需为嵌入模型添加视觉交互能力。

Method: 提出VIRTUE，扩展分割模型和视觉语言模型能力到表征学习领域；引入SCaR基准测试。

Result: VIRTUE在36个通用MMEB任务和5个视觉交互SCaR任务上显著提升，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE能有效处理视觉交互，提升嵌入模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Result: 得出RAG系统四个处理阶段的15个不同数据质量维度。

Conclusion: 传统数据质量框架需添加新维度，应采取前置质量管理策略，需动态、分步骤的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

Result: 提出的方法显著缓解漏洞，对任务性能影响小，提升了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调了针对DLMs进行特定安全研究的必要性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发HARPA解决自动科学发现中假设生成难题，评估显示其在多方面表现良好，还能基于实验结果学习奖励模型，推动AI驱动的科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动科学发现工具难以生成可测试且基于科学文献的假设，且现有构思工具无法适应先前实验结果。

Method: 借鉴人类研究人员的构思流程，先通过文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势，再探索假设设计空间，最后确定精确可测试的假设；还学习奖励模型根据先前实验结果对新假设评分。

Result: HARPA生成的假设驱动研究提案在多数定性维度上与强大基线相当，在可行性和依据性上显著提升；与ASD代理测试时成功率更高、失败率更低；奖励模型比未训练的基线评分器有约28%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 这些方法是AI驱动科学发现领域的一个进步。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究指出大语言模型知识编辑现有方法可能基于捷径而非语义，需重新审视基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在过时或错误知识，模型编辑虽有成果但可靠性基础脆弱，当前评估框架有缺陷。

Method: 系统开发一套新评估方法。

Result: 最先进方法在简单否定查询下失效，编辑可能基于捷径而非完整语义。

Conclusion: 在进一步推进前需重新审视模型编辑的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CDDM用于实时轻量级轨迹预测，在基准测试中达SOTA，实现资源高效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在轨迹预测中虽性能强，但模型大、采样慢，难以实际部署。

Method: 基于CPD，将知识从高容量教师模型逐步转移到轻量级学生模型，引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失。

Result: 在ETH - UCY和nuScenes基准测试中达SOTA，保留大部分ADE和FDE性能，参数少、采样步骤少、加速明显、延迟低。

Conclusion: CDDM能将高性能生成模型与实际部署约束结合，实现资源高效的概率预测。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出训练无关的KV缓存压缩方法Expected Attention及库KVPress，可跨阶段有效压缩KV缓存且性能佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存内存消耗是大语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的KV缓存剪枝方法有实际限制。

Method: 引入Expected Attention方法，利用LLM激活的分布特性计算每个KV对的预期注意力分数，对KV对进行排序和剪枝；发布KVPress库。

Result: 方法能在不降低性能的情况下有效压缩，在预填充和解码阶段均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Expected Attention方法有效解决了KV缓存压缩问题，KVPress库有助于研究人员开展相关工作。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch

loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and

Motivation: 许多游戏因游戏树指数增长未被解决，虽有AlphaZero等方法但仍需优化，且RZ不唯一，更小RZ更有利。

Method: 提出迭代RZ缩减方法，设计三种约束生成策略并集成RZ模式表。

Result: 在7x7 Killall - Go实验中，平均RZ大小降至原85.95%，缩减后的RZ可作为可复用知识用于未来求解任务。

Conclusion: 所提迭代RZ缩减方法有效，能减少搜索空间，缩减后的RZ具有复用价值。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，ACPO始终优于DAPO和PAPO等强基线，实现了最先进的性能、加速收敛和更好的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ACPO框架有效解决了现有策略优化算法的问题，提升了视觉语言模型的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Method: 从对称性和难度两个角度提出数据增强管道，包括基于AST的EvolAST、利用LLMs的EvolDomain和基于进化指令的EvolDifficulty，并用增强数据训练EvolProver。

Result: EvolProver在FormalMATH - Lite、MiniF2F - Test等多个基准测试中超越同类模型，取得新的SOTA成绩。

Conclusion: 数据增强管道在多个基准测试中有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 框架和结果能为行业和研究界提供对抗AI恶意使用的实用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于基于成本的语义和c-表示法的进一步研究。

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Motivation: 组织利用流程数据决策时，将数据转化为可用知识困难，自动知识发现存在复杂问题待解决。

Method: 引入基于蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS）的自动洞察与数据探索（AIDE）方法。

Result: 用真实和合成数据评估AIDE，证明其能识别数据转换和模型以发现有趣数据模式。

Conclusion: AIDE的MCTS框架有扩展性，是迈向自动知识发现综合解决方案的重要一步。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: 现有多模态知识图谱方法在低资源场景表现有限，本文提出FusionAdapter用于少样本关系学习，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态知识图谱方法主要将模态对齐到共享空间，忽略特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源场景下性能受限。

Method: 提出FusionAdapter，包含使各模态有效适应未见关系的适配器模块，以及在保留特定模态特征的同时融合多模态实体表示的融合策略。

Result: 在两个基准多模态知识图谱数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FusionAdapter通过有效适应和融合多模态信息，能在最少监督下提高对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: DAIL能跨未见环境和策略优化算法泛化，性能优于人类设计的基线。

Conclusion: 分析了DAIL训练更稳定的原因，为奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供新见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

Conclusion: 提出的测试时随机搜索方法能有效提升模型在CVRP问题中生成割平面的性能。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Conclusion: QUASAR框架能有效提升量子电路生成和优化效果。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

Result: 不同特征形成多种几何结构，SMDS揭示这些结构能反映概念特性、跨模型稳定、支持推理、随上下文动态变化

Conclusion: 研究结果阐明特征流形功能角色，支持语言模型编码和转换结构化表示的实体推理模型

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

Conclusion: 研究指出推动大语言模型成为人类概念表征模型的关键计算要素，弥补了大语言模型评估的基准测试缺口。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒可解释性方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成突变体，导致分布外图像，影响解释质量且选择遮挡值需领域知识。

Method: 引入AD范式，通过关闭模型对应部分去除遮挡输入特征影响；提出ConvAD机制，可添加到任意训练好的CNN中。

Result: 实验对比显示AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上稳健性最高提升62.5%。

Conclusion: ConvAD无需领域知识就能提取更稳健的解释，且不改变网络决策过程。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Result: 可将CoT推理痕迹转换成良好类型的证明，作为计算忠实性的可验证证书。

Conclusion: 该框架能将似是而非的叙述性解释转化为形式上可验证的程序，为构建更可靠、可信的AI系统提供了途径。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

Method: 提出Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL)方法，将模型内部信心转化为自我生成奖励信号，强化低熵拒绝行为。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20多种越狱方法防御成功率超89%，用15000个无标签提示超越资源密集型监督方法，且保留多方面性能。

Conclusion: 有效的对齐可以从模型内部产生，为减少人工监督的AI安全机制发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

Method: 第一层将订单-生产线分配作为约束规划（CP）问题，第二层将工人-生产线分配建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并实现贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种策略进行比较，通过与汽车行业专家的16次测试验证系统。

Conclusion: 结合CP与学习型决策为以人为本生产规划提供可靠方法，可同时优化吞吐量和员工福祉。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法无需昂贵微调或专用图数据库，可有效分析供应链风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

Motivation: 探索不依靠大规模参数，而是通过训练设计使模型达到前沿多模态推理性能。

Method: 从Pixtral - 12B开始，采用三阶段方法：深度提升、分阶段持续预训练、高质量纯文本监督微调。

Result: 模型在不使用强化学习和偏好优化下取得有竞争力结果，在相关指数和图像基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 精心的训练设计能缩小能力差距，让资源有限组织也可实现前沿多模态推理。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance
open-source research.

TL;DR: 提出Bridge方法并行生成相互依赖的响应，用少量新参数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有并行LLM推理中N个并行响应相互独立，未充分利用潜在信息，为获取更高质量响应和响应集。

Method: 重新将批量LLM隐藏状态视为整体张量，提出Bridge方法并行生成相互依赖的响应。

Result: 仅用2.8%-5.1%的新参数，将基于可验证奖励的强化学习相对平均准确率提升达50%，提高正确响应的一致性。

Conclusion: Bridge可扩展到任意生成宽度，性能优于独立生成，开启更通用的并行扩展模式，能有效利用序列间信息，与任何生成后聚合技术兼容。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

TL;DR: 提出基于LoRA的联邦微调方法解决大语言模型在医疗应用中的数据隐私和跨机构协作问题，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗应用受数据隐私和跨机构协作挑战阻碍，非IID特征使收敛和公平性问题更复杂。

Method: 提出基于LoRA的联邦微调方法，迭代结合本地LoRA适配和全局参数聚合，用区块链身份方案识别LLM。

Result: 在异构和高度非IID医疗文本数据集上实验，联邦LoRA增强跨客户端泛化，提升最弱客户端性能，实现稳定收敛和更公平结果。

Conclusion: 联邦LoRA微调是医疗领域适配大语言模型的实用有效范式，为多中心医疗AI协作提供新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show great promise in healthcare, but their
applications are hindered by data privacy restrictions and the challenges of
cross-institution collaboration. Sensitive medical data cannot be centralized,
while non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics
across institutions further complicate convergence and fairness. To address
these issues, we present a federated fine-tuning approach based on Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), enabling privacy-preserving knowledge flow across
institutions. The method iteratively combines local LoRA adaptation with global
parameter aggregation, allowing efficient knowledge sharing without exposing
raw data. A blockchain identity scheme is used for identifying individual LLM
in such a distributed network. We evaluate this approach on heterogeneous and
highly non-IID medical text datasets, where experiments demonstrate that
federated LoRA not only enhances cross-client generalization but also improves
the performance of the weakest client, achieving stable convergence and fairer
outcomes. These findings highlight federated LoRA fine-tuning as a practical
and effective paradigm for adapting LLMs in healthcare, offering a new path for
multi-center medical AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 论文探索无监督域适应技术，解决信号分类模型在不同域间泛化问题，实验表明STAR和JAN方法有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度神经网络的信号分类模型在实际场景泛化能力差，需缩小不匹配域间的泛化差距。

Method: 研究基于对抗学习、统计距离对齐和随机建模的适应方法，生成模拟OTA特征的调制信号，在三种场景下评估分类性能。

Result: 无监督域适应方法，尤其是STAR和JAN，相比基线模型有持续且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 无监督域适应方法，如STAR和JAN，在无线系统实际部署中有应用前景。

Abstract: Signal classification models based on deep neural networks are typically
trained on datasets collected under controlled conditions, either simulated or
over-the-air (OTA), which are constrained to specific channel environments with
limited variability, such as fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. As a
result, these models often fail to generalize when deployed in real-world
scenarios where the feature distribution significantly differs from the
training domain. This paper explores unsupervised domain adaptation techniques
to bridge the generalization gap between mismatched domains. Specifically, we
investigate adaptation methods based on adversarial learning, statistical
distance alignment, and stochastic modeling to align representations between
simulated and OTA signal domains. To emulate OTA characteristics, we
deliberately generate modulated signals subjected to realistic channel
impairments without demodulation. We evaluate classification performance under
three scenarios, i.e., cross-SNR, SNR-matched cross-domain, and stepwise
adaptation involving both SNR and domain shifts. Experimental results show that
unsupervised domain adaptation methods, particularly stochastic classifier
(STAR) and joint adaptive networks (JAN), enable consistent and substantial
performance gains over baseline models, which highlight their promise for
real-world deployment in wireless systems.

### [63] [The Economic Impact of DeFi Crime Events on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00669)
*Stefan Kitzler,Masarah Paquet-Clouston,Bernhard Haslhofer*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 研究分析2020 - 2022年22起DeFi犯罪事件对DAO治理资产价格、交易量和市值的经济影响，发现犯罪事件带来显著负面价格影响和交易量增加，估计间接经济损失超13亿美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi生态因犯罪事件有超10亿美元直接损失，且引发市场反应，需评估犯罪事件对DAO治理资产的经济影响。

Method: 利用DeFi交易数据，对22起犯罪事件进行事件研究，采用动态双重差分（DiD）框架和反事实治理资产进行日内因果推断。

Result: 55%犯罪事件导致显著负面价格影响，平均跌幅约14%；68%犯罪事件使治理资产交易量增加；估计DAO市值间接经济损失超13亿美元，占总损失74%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示犯罪事件对市场动态和DAO的影响，方法可重复且适用于评估其他加密资产间接经济影响。

Abstract: The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem has experienced over \$10 billion
in direct losses due to crime events. Beyond these immediate losses, such
events often trigger broader market reactions, including price declines,
trading activity changes, and reductions in market capitalization.
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) govern DeFi applications through
tradable governance assets that function like corporate shares for voting and
decision-making. Leveraging DeFi's granular trading data, we conduct an event
study on 22 crime events between 2020 and 2022 to assess their economic impact
on governance asset prices, trading volumes, and market capitalization. Using a
dynamic difference-in-differences (DiD) framework with counterfactual
governance assets, we aim for causal inference of intraday temporal effects.
Our results show that 55% of crime events lead to significant negative price
impacts, with an average decline of about 14%. Additionally, 68% of crime
events lead to increased governance asset trading volume. Based on these
impacts, we estimate indirect economic losses of over $1.3 billion in DAO
market capitalization, far exceeding direct victim costs and accounting for 74%
of total losses. Our study provides valuable insights into how crime events
shape market dynamics and affect DAOs. Moreover, our methodological approach is
reproducible and applicable beyond DAOs, offering a framework to assess the
indirect economic impact on other cryptoassets.

TL;DR: 本文介绍开源有限元框架COMMET，通过新算法和优化减少NCMs计算成本，加速大规模模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂材料模型下，NCMs在大规模有限元模拟中因计算成本高应用受限。

Method: 重新设计框架架构，采用新装配算法支持批量和矢量化本构评估，用计算图优化导数替代自动微分，通过MPI实现分布式内存并行。

Result: 显著减少运行时间，比传统非矢量化自动微分实现加速超三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算力学大规模、高保真模拟树立新标准，原理广泛适用于循环装配或本构更新限制性能的场景。

Abstract: Constitutive evaluations often dominate the computational cost of finite
element (FE) simulations whenever material models are complex. Neural
constitutive models (NCMs) offer a highly expressive and flexible framework for
modeling complex material behavior in solid mechanics. However, their practical
adoption in large-scale FE simulations remains limited due to significant
computational costs, especially in repeatedly evaluating stress and stiffness.
NCMs thus represent an extreme case: their large computational graphs make
stress and stiffness evaluations prohibitively expensive, restricting their use
to small-scale problems. In this work, we introduce COMMET, an open-source FE
framework whose architecture has been redesigned from the ground up to
accelerate high-cost constitutive updates. Our framework features a novel
assembly algorithm that supports batched and vectorized constitutive
evaluations, compute-graph-optimized derivatives that replace automatic
differentiation, and distributed-memory parallelism via MPI. These advances
dramatically reduce runtime, with speed-ups exceeding three orders of magnitude
relative to traditional non-vectorized automatic differentiation-based
implementations. While we demonstrate these gains primarily for NCMs, the same
principles apply broadly wherever for-loop based assembly or constitutive
updates limit performance, establishing a new standard for large-scale,
high-fidelity simulations in computational mechanics.

Motivation: 提出新的金融市场建模框架，以更好捕捉资产回报的统计特性。

Method: 基于多时间跨度的动量和风险特征对历史回报进行聚类，识别市场状态，构建概率状态机生成回报分布。

Result: 提出的基准在捕捉资产回报关键统计特性（偏度和峰度）上显著优于传统方法，跨随机资产和时间段的实验证实其稳健性。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于可解释概率状态机的金融市场建模框架有效且稳健。

Abstract: This work introduces a new framework for modeling financial markets through
an interpretable probabilistic state machine. By clustering historical returns
based on momentum and risk features across multiple time horizons, we identify
distinct market states that capture underlying regimes, such as expansion
phase, contraction, crisis, or recovery. From a transition matrix representing
the dynamics between these states, we construct a probabilistic state machine
that models the temporal evolution of the market. This state machine enables
the generation of a custom distribution of returns based on a mixture of
Gaussian components weighted by state frequencies. We show that the proposed
benchmark significantly outperforms the traditional approach in capturing key
statistical properties of asset returns, including skewness and kurtosis, and
our experiments across random assets and time periods confirm its robustness.

TL;DR: 提出AutoPK框架从复杂科学表格中提取药代动力学（PK）数据，在真实数据集上评估显示其性能优于直接使用大语言模型，适用于多领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PK数据常嵌于复杂异构表格，给自动检索和标准化带来挑战，需要有效方法提取数据。

Method: AutoPK分两阶段，第一阶段用大语言模型等识别提取PK参数变体，第二阶段过滤相关行、转换表格格式、重构标准化表格。

Result: 在605个PK表格数据集上评估，AutoPK在精度和召回率上显著提升，小模型配合AutoPK有2 - 7倍F1提升，开源模型能超越商业系统。

Conclusion: AutoPK可实现可扩展、高置信度的PK数据提取，适用于兽医药理学等关键应用，能应对表格结构和术语问题，具有跨参数的通用性。

Abstract: Pharmacokinetics (PK) plays a critical role in drug development and
regulatory decision-making for human and veterinary medicine, directly
affecting public health through drug safety and efficacy assessments. However,
PK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable
structures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for
automated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage
framework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex
scientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK
parameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity
metric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,
converts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct
a standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,
including captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in
precision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA
3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance
parameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and
0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with
AutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's
hallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled
open-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as
GPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and
high-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical
applications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public
health decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and
terminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据货币化背景下，需要一个全面的方法来评估数据质量，以实现数据质量管理与可持续价值创造的对齐。

Method: 通过系统文献综述，将超百个指标和KPI组织到平衡计分卡框架的四个子集群中。

Result: 提出的分类法将数据质量定位为平衡计分卡各视角的战略连接点，其“指标层”能使各维度改进相互促进。

Conclusion: 这种整体方法弥合了技术评估与高层决策的差距，为相关人员提供了可扩展、基于证据的参考。

Abstract: This chapter presents a comprehensive taxonomy for assessing data quality in
the context of data monetisation, developed through a systematic literature
review. Organising over one hundred metrics and Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) into four subclusters (Fundamental, Contextual, Resolution, and
Specialised) within the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework, the taxonomy
integrates both universal and domain-specific quality dimensions. By
positioning data quality as a strategic connector across the BSC's Financial,
Customer, Internal Processes, and Learning & Growth perspectives, it
demonstrates how quality metrics underpin valuation accuracy, customer trust,
operational efficiency, and innovation capacity. The framework's interconnected
"metrics layer" ensures that improvements in one dimension cascade into others,
maximising strategic impact. This holistic approach bridges the gap between
granular technical assessment and high-level decision-making, offering
practitioners, data stewards, and strategists a scalable, evidence-based
reference for aligning data quality management with sustainable value creation.

Motivation: 现有机器学习临床预测模型依赖电子病历结构化数据，但提取过程由硬编码、特定数据库管道主导，限制了可扩展性、可重复性和跨机构泛化性。

Method: 引入基于代理的EMR - AGENT框架，通过动态语言模型驱动交互替代手动规则编写，自动化完成队列选择、特征提取和代码映射，模块化代理利用SQL进行数据库观察和决策。开发三个EMR数据库的基准代码库。

Result: 在三个EMR数据库上表现出强性能和泛化性。

Conclusion: 自动化此前认为需专家设计的数据提取过程是可行的。

Abstract: Machine learning models for clinical prediction rely on structured data
extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), yet this process remains
dominated by hardcoded, database-specific pipelines for cohort definition,
feature selection, and code mapping. These manual efforts limit scalability,
reproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we
introduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an
agent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language
model-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.
Our framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping
through interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively
observe query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not
just for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and
decision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific
logic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for
three EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen
schema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization
across these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process
previously thought to require expert-driven design. The code will be released
publicly at https://github.com/AITRICS/EMR-AGENT/tree/main. For a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式AI工作负载扩展至数据中心外，现有解决方案不适用于异构无许可环境，需新通信基础架构。

Method: Lattica集成NAT遍历机制建立对等网络、基于CRDTs的去中心化数据存储、利用DHT和优化RPC协议的内容发现层。

Result: Lattica提供完整协议栈，实现独立于集中式中介的主权、弹性和可扩展AI系统。

Conclusion: Lattica适用于边缘智能、协作强化学习等大规模分布式机器学习场景。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads
beyond centralized data centers creates a demand for new communication
substrates. These substrates must operate reliably in heterogeneous and
permissionless environments, where Network Address Translators (NATs) and
firewalls impose significant constraints. Existing solutions, however, are
either designed for controlled data center deployments or implemented as
monolithic systems that tightly couple machine learning logic with networking
code. To address these limitations, we present Lattica, a decentralized
cross-NAT communication framework designed to support distributed AI systems.
Lattica integrates three core components. First, it employs a robust suite of
NAT traversal mechanisms to establish a globally addressable peer-to-peer mesh.
Second, it provides a decentralized data store based on Conflict-free
Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring verifiable and eventually consistent
state replication. Third, it incorporates a content discovery layer that
leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) together with an optimized RPC
protocol for efficient model synchronization. By integrating these components,
Lattica delivers a complete protocol stack for sovereign, resilient, and
scalable AI systems that operate independently of centralized intermediaries.
It is directly applicable to edge intelligence, collaborative reinforcement
learning, and other large-scale distributed machine learning scenarios.

Motivation: 现有分布式MoE训练工作主要关注MoE层内任务调度，忽略其他关键操作，为进一步提高训练效率，需提出新框架。

Method: 构建统一管道调度MHA计算、门控、专家计算和A2A通信；引入基于张量块的优先级调度机制使全规约通信与所有计算任务重叠；在PyTorch上实现自适应通用框架。

Result: 对675个典型MoE层和四个真实世界MoE模型在两个GPU集群上实验，FlowMoE框架减少训练时间13%-57%，能耗10%-39%，内存使用7%-32%。

Conclusion: FlowMoE框架在分布式MoE训练中表现优于现有框架，能有效提高训练效率。

Abstract: The parameter size of modern large language models (LLMs) can be scaled up
via the sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to avoid
excessive increase of the computational costs. To further improve training
efficiency, pipelining computation and communication has become a promising
solution for distributed MoE training. However, existing work primarily focuses
on scheduling tasks within the MoE layer, such as expert computing and
all-to-all (A2A) communication, while neglecting other key operations including
multi-head attention (MHA) computing, gating, and all-reduce communication. In
this paper, we propose FlowMoE, a scalable framework for scheduling multi-type
task pipelines. First, FlowMoE constructs a unified pipeline to consistently
scheduling MHA computing, gating, expert computing, and A2A communication.
Second, FlowMoE introduces a tensor chunk-based priority scheduling mechanism
to overlap the all-reduce communication with all computing tasks. We implement
FlowMoE as an adaptive and generic framework atop PyTorch. Extensive
experiments with 675 typical MoE layers and four real-world MoE models across
two GPU clusters demonstrate that our proposed FlowMoE framework outperforms
state-of-the-art MoE training frameworks, reducing training time by 13%-57%,
energy consumption by 10%-39%, and memory usage by 7%-32%.

Abstract: Modern blockchains need fast, reliable propagation to balance security and

iterative updates, leaving nodes out of sync. We present BlockSDN-VC, a
transaction-broadcast protocol that centralises coordinate computation and
forwarding control in an SDN controller, delivering global consistency, minimal
path stretch and rapid response to churn or congestion. In geo-distributed

convergence fourfold over state-of-the-art schemes with under 3% control-plane
overhead. In a real blockchain environment, BlockSDN-VC boosts
confirmed-transaction throughput by 17% under adversarial workloads, requiring
no modifications to existing clients.

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) systems are becoming increasingly
water-intensive due to their reliance on water-based cooling and the energy
used in power generation. However, the water footprint of HPC remains
relatively underexplored-especially in contrast to the growing focus on carbon
emissions. In this paper, we present ThirstyFLOPS - a comprehensive water
footprint analysis framework for HPC systems. Our approach incorporates
region-specific metrics, including Water Usage Effectiveness, Power Usage
Effectiveness, and Energy Water Factor, to quantify water consumption using
real-world data. Using four representative HPC systems - Marconi, Fugaku,
Polaris, and Frontier - as examples, we provide implications for HPC system
planning and management. We explore the impact of regional water scarcity and
nuclear-based energy strategies on HPC sustainability. Our findings aim to
advance the development of water-aware, environmentally responsible computing
infrastructures.

Conclusion: 两阶段生物启发混合算法能有效应对云资源管理的动态和多目标特性。

Abstract: Datacenters consume a growing share of energy, prompting the need for
sustainable resource management. This paper presents a Hybrid ACO-PSO (HAPSO)
algorithm for energy-aware virtual machine (VM) placement and migration in
green cloud datacenters. In the first stage, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
performs energy-efficient initial placement across physical hosts, ensuring
global feasibility. In the second stage, a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) refines allocations by migrating VMs from overloaded or underutilized
hosts. HAPSO introduces several innovations: sequential hybridization of
metaheuristics, system-informed particle initialization using ACO output,
heuristic-guided discretization for constraint handling, and a multi-objective
fitness function that minimizes active servers and resource wastage.
Implemented in CloudSimPlus, extensive simulations demonstrate that HAPSO
consistently outperforms classical heuristics (BFD, FFD), Unified Ant Colony
System (UACS), and ACO-only. Notably, HAPSO achieves up to 25% lower energy
consumption and 18% fewer SLA violations compared to UACS at large-scale
workloads, while sustaining stable cost and carbon emissions. These results
highlight the effectiveness of two-stage bio-inspired hybridization in
addressing the dynamic and multi-objective nature of cloud resource management.

TL;DR: 本文提出弹性训练系统ElasWave，通过多维度调度实现容错，在多方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模LLM预训练中故障常见，弹性训练成为必要，但现有工作未同时满足参数一致性、低平均恢复时间、高变更后吞吐量和计算一致性的目标。

Method: 提出ElasWave，通过跨图、数据流、频率和随机数生成的多维度调度提供每步容错，调整微批次工作负载，进行在线流水线重分片，使用DVFS吸收流水线气泡，重分片RNG等。

Result: 在96个NPUs上评估，吞吐量相比ReCycle提高1.35倍，相比TorchFT提高1.60倍；通信器恢复在一秒内完成；迁移MTTR最多下降51%；收敛偏差降低约78%。

Conclusion: ElasWave在大规模LLM预训练的弹性训练中表现出色，能有效实现多方面目标。

Abstract: Large-scale LLM pretraining today spans $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ accelerators,
making failures commonplace and elasticity no longer optional. We posit that an
elastic-native training system must simultaneously ensure (i) Parameter
Consistency, (ii) low Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), (iii) high post-change
Throughput, and (iv) Computation Consistency. This objective set not has never
been jointly attained by prior work. To achieve these goals, we present
ElasWave, which provides per-step fault tolerance via multi-dimensional
scheduling across Graph, Dataflow, Frequency, and Random Number Generation.
ElasWave resizes and reshards micro-batch workloads while preserving the global
batch size and gradient scale; it performs online pipeline resharding with
asynchronous parameter migration, interleaving ZeRO partitions so recovery
reduces to disjoint rank-to-rank transfers. It further uses DVFS to absorb
pipeline bubbles and reshards RNG to keep consistent computations. A dynamic
communicator enables in-place communication group edits, while per-step
in-memory snapshots support online verification and redistribution. We
evaluated ElasWave on 96 NPUs and benchmarked against state-of-the-art
baselines: throughput improves by $1.35\times$ over ReCycle and $1.60\times$
over TorchFT; communicator recovery completes within one second (up to
$82\times/3.6\times$ faster than full/partial rebuilds); migration MTTR drops
by as much as $51\%$; and convergence deviation is reduced by approximately
$78\%$.

Abstract: The integration of Terrestrial Networks (TN) and Non-Terrestrial Networks
(NTN) plays a crucial role in bridging the digital divide and enabling Sixth
Generation (6G) and beyond to achieve truly ubiquitous connectivity. However,
combining TN and NTN introduces significant energy challenges due to the

paper, we present for the first time a comprehensive overview of the design
challenges associated with achieving Net-Zero energy targets in integrated TN
and NTN systems. We outline a set of key enabling technologies that can support
the energy demands of such networks while aligning with Net-Zero objectives. To
enhance the Energy Efficiency (EE) of integrated TN and NTN systems, we provide
a use case analysis that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver
adaptable solutions across diverse deployment scenarios. Finally, we highlight
promising research directions that can guide the sustainable evolution of
integrated TN and NTN.

Abstract: Key graph-based problems play a central role in understanding network
topology and uncovering patterns of similarity in homogeneous and temporal
data. Such patterns can be revealed by analyzing communities formed by nodes,
which in turn can be effectively modeled through temporal $k$-cores. This paper
introduces a novel decentralized and incremental algorithm for computing the
core decomposition of temporal networks. Decentralized solutions leverage the
ability of network nodes to communicate and coordinate locally, addressing
complex problems in a scalable, adaptive, and timely manner. By leveraging
previously computed coreness values, our approach significantly reduces the
activation of nodes and the volume of message exchanges when the network
changes over time. This enables scalability with only a minimal trade-off in
precision. Experimental evaluations on large real-world networks under varying
levels of dynamism demonstrate the efficiency of our solution compared to a
state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of active nodes, communication
overhead, and convergence speed.

Result: 用ATLAS PanDA工作负载评估，校准精度显著提高，多站点模拟近线性扩展，分布式工作负载性能更好。

Conclusion: CGSim能在实际时间预算和普通硬件上模拟大规模分布式计算基础设施。

Abstract: Large-scale distributed computing infrastructures such as the Worldwide LHC
Computing Grid (WLCG) require comprehensive simulation tools for evaluating
performance, testing new algorithms, and optimizing resource allocation
strategies. However, existing simulators suffer from limited scalability,
hardwired algorithms, lack of real-time monitoring, and inability to generate
datasets suitable for modern machine learning approaches. We present CGSim, a
simulation framework for large-scale distributed computing environments that
addresses these limitations. Built upon the validated SimGrid simulation
framework, CGSim provides high-level abstractions for modeling heterogeneous
grid environments while maintaining accuracy and scalability. Key features
include a modular plugin mechanism for testing custom workflow scheduling and
data movement policies, interactive real-time visualization dashboards, and
automatic generation of event-level datasets suitable for AI-assisted
performance modeling. We demonstrate CGSim's capabilities through a
comprehensive evaluation using production ATLAS PanDA workloads, showing
significant calibration accuracy improvements across WLCG computing sites.
Scalability experiments show near-linear scaling for multi-site simulations,
with distributed workloads achieving 6x better performance compared to
single-site execution. The framework enables researchers to simulate WLCG-scale
infrastructures with hundreds of sites and thousands of concurrent jobs within
practical time budget constraints on commodity hardware.

Result: 得到数据访问和移动的完整细粒度视图，识别出违反数据中心作业分配原则的异常传输模式。

Conclusion: 提出缓解策略，强调加强PanDA - Rucio协调可提高资源利用率、减少不必要数据移动和增强系统弹性。

Abstract: Large-scale international collaborations such as ATLAS rely on globally
distributed workflows and data management to process, move, and store vast
volumes of data. ATLAS's Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) workflow
system and the Rucio data management system are each highly optimized for their
respective design goals. However, operating them together at global scale
exposes systemic inefficiencies, including underutilized resources, redundant
or unnecessary transfers, and altered error distributions. Moreover, PanDA and
Rucio currently lack shared performance awareness and coordinated, adaptive
strategies.
  This work charts a path toward co-optimizing the two systems by diagnosing
data-management pitfalls and prioritizing end-to-end improvements. With the
observation of spatially and temporally imbalanced transfer activities, we
develop a metadata-matching algorithm that links PanDA jobs and Rucio datasets
at the file level, yielding a complete, fine-grained view of data access and
movement. Using this linkage, we identify anomalous transfer patterns that
violate PanDA's data-centric job-allocation principle. We then outline
mitigation strategies for these patterns and highlight opportunities for
tighter PanDA-Rucio coordination to improve resource utilization, reduce
unnecessary data movement, and enhance overall system resilience.

Abstract: Federated unlearning (FUL) enables removing the data influence from the model
trained across distributed clients, upholding the right to be forgotten as
mandated by privacy regulations. FUL facilitates a value exchange where clients
gain privacy-preserving control over their data contributions, while service
providers leverage decentralized computing and data freshness. However, this
entire proposition is undermined because clients have no reliable way to verify
that their data influence has been provably removed, as current metrics and
simple notifications offer insufficient assurance. We envision unlearning
verification becoming a pivotal and trust-by-design part of the FUL life-cycle
development, essential for highly regulated and data-sensitive services and
applications like healthcare. This article introduces veriFUL, a reference
framework for verifiable FUL that formalizes verification entities, goals,
approaches, and metrics. Specifically, we consolidate existing efforts and
contribute new insights, concepts, and metrics to this domain. Finally, we
highlight research challenges and identify potential applications and
developments for verifiable FUL and veriFUL.

Abstract: Large-scale LLM training requires collective communication libraries to
exchange data among distributed GPUs. As a company dedicated to building and
operating large-scale GPU training clusters, we encounter several challenges
when using NCCL in production, including 1) limited efficiency with costly and
cumbersome P2P communication, 2) poor tolerance to frequent RNIC port failures,
and 3) insufficient observability of transient collective communication
anomalies. To address these issues, we propose ICCL, an efficient, reliable,
and observable collective communication library in large-scale GPU training
clusters. ICCL offloads the P2P communication from GPU kernels to CPU threads
for minimal SM consumption, and removes the redundant memory copies irrelevant
to the actual communicating process. ICCL also introduces a primary-backup QP
mechanism to tolerate frequent NIC port failures, and designs a window-based
monitor to observe network anomalies at O(us) level. We open-source ICCL and
deploy it in production training clusters for several months, with results
showing that compared to NCCL, ICCL achieves a 23.4%/28.5% improvement in P2P
throughput/latency as well as a 6.02% increase in training throughput. We also
share the operating experience of ICCL in large-scale clusters, hoping to give
the communities more insights on production-level collective communication
libraries in LLM training.

Conclusion: 确认了前人关于无权重单边局部交叉最小化问题NP难的猜想，且特定方案的中位数启发式有良好近似比。

Abstract: Drawing graphs with the minimum number of crossings is a classical problem
that has been studied extensively. Many restricted versions of the problem have
been considered. For example, bipartite graphs can be drawn such that the two
sets in the bipartition of the vertex set are mapped to two parallel lines, and
the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. In this setting, the number of
crossings depends only on the ordering of the vertices on the two lines. Two
natural variants of the problem have been studied. In the one-sided case, the
order of the vertices on one of the two lines is given and fixed; in the
two-sided case, no order is given. Both cases are important subproblems in the
so-called Sugiyama framework for drawing layered graphs with few crossings, and
both turned out to be NP-hard. For the one-sided case, Eades and Wormald
[Algorithmica 1994] introduced the median heuristic and showed that it has an
approximation ratio of 3.
  In recent years, researchers have focused on a local version of crossing
minimization where the aim is not to minimize the total number of crossings but
the maximum number of crossings per edge. Kobayashi, Okada, and Wolff [SoCG
2025] investigated the complexity of local crossing minimization parameterized
by the natural parameter. They showed that the weighted one-sided problem is
NP-hard and conjectured that the unweighted one-sided case remains NP-hard. In
this work, we confirm their conjecture. We also prove that the median heuristic
with a specific tie-breaking scheme has an approximation ratio of 3.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning exponential distributions under differential
privacy. Given $n$ i.i.d.\ samples from $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$, the goal is to
privately estimate $\lambda$ so that the learned distribution is close in total
variation distance to the truth. We present two complementary pure DP
algorithms: one adapts the classical maximum likelihood estimator via clipping
and Laplace noise, while the other leverages the fact that the
$(1-1/e)$-quantile equals $1/\lambda$. Each method excels in a different
regime, and we combine them into an adaptive best-of-both algorithm achieving
near-optimal sample complexity for all $\lambda$. We further extend our
approach to Pareto distributions via a logarithmic reduction, prove nearly
matching lower bounds using packing and group privacy \cite{Karwa2017FiniteSD},
and show how approximate $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP removes the need for externally
supplied bounds. Together, these results give the first tight characterization
of exponential distribution learning under DP and illustrate the power of
adaptive strategies for heavy-tailed laws.

Result: 为多割、有向多割、奇圈横截和顶点覆盖奇圈横截等问题获得随机多项式边界核化。

Conclusion: 图的局部部分通过边界分离足以进行这些方法的局部应用。

Abstract: A kernelization is an efficient algorithm that given an instance of a
parameterized problem returns an equivalent instance of size bounded by some
function of the input parameter value. It is quite well understood which
problems do or (conditionally) do not admit a kernelization where this size
bound is polynomial, a so-called polynomial kernelization. Unfortunately, such
polynomial kernelizations are known only in fairly restrictive settings where a
small parameter value corresponds to a strong restriction on the global
structure on the instance. Motivated by this, Antipov and Kratsch [WG 2025]
proposed a local variant of kernelization, called boundaried kernelization,
that requires only local structure to achieve a local improvement of the
instance, which is in the spirit of protrusion replacement used in
meta-kernelization [Bodlaender et al.\ JACM 2016]. They obtain polynomial
boundaried kernelizations as well as (unconditional) lower bounds for several
well-studied problems in kernelization.
  In this work, we leverage the matroid-based techniques of Kratsch and
Wahlstr\"om [JACM 2020] to obtain randomized polynomial boundaried
kernelizations for \smultiwaycut, \dtmultiwaycut, \oddcycletransversal, and
\vertexcoveroct, for which randomized polynomial kernelizations in the usual
sense were known before. A priori, these techniques rely on the global
connectivity of the graph to identify reducible (irrelevant) vertices.
Nevertheless, the separation of the local part by its boundary turns out to be
sufficient for a local application of these methods.

Method: 研究Ranking和Online Correlated Selection (OCS)这两种经典的在线匹配算法。

Result: 对于固定d≥2，OCS竞争比至少为0.835且高于Ranking；当d趋于无穷，OCS至少0.897竞争，Ranking至多0.816竞争，还给出结果在(k,d)有界图上的扩展。

Conclusion: 在(d,d)有界图的在线二部匹配问题中，OCS算法的竞争比表现优于Ranking算法。

Abstract: We revisit the online bipartite matching problem on $d$-regular graphs, for
which Cohen and Wajc (SODA 2018) proposed an algorithm with a competitive ratio
of $1-2\sqrt{H_d/d} = 1-O(\sqrt{(\log d)/d})$ and showed that it is
asymptotically near-optimal for $d=\omega(1)$. However, their ratio is
meaningful only for sufficiently large $d$, e.g., the ratio is less than
$1-1/e$ when $d\leq 168$. In this work, we study the problem on $(d,d)$-bounded
graphs (a slightly more general class of graphs than $d$-regular) and consider
two classic algorithms for online matching problems: \Ranking and Online
Correlated Selection (OCS). We show that for every fixed $d\geq 2$, the
competitive ratio of OCS is at least $0.835$ and always higher than that of
\Ranking. When $d\to \infty$, we show that OCS is at least $0.897$-competitive
while \Ranking is at most $0.816$-competitive. We also show some extensions of
our results to $(k,d)$-bounded graphs.

Conclusion: 明确了二分图完美比例分配与匹配覆盖的关系，并拓展到非匹配覆盖图。

Abstract: Given a bipartite graph that has a perfect matching, a prefect proportional
allocation is an assignment of positive weights to the nodes of the right
partition so that every left node is fractionally assigned to its neighbors in
proportion to their weights, and these assignments define a fractional perfect
matching. We prove that a bipartite graph has a perfect proportional allocation
if and only if it is matching covered, by using a classical result on matrix
scaling. We also present an extension of this result to provide simple
proportional allocations in non-matching-covered bipartite graphs.

Abstract: Studying the impact of cooperation in strategic settings is one of the
cornerstones of algorithmic game theory. Intuitively, allowing more cooperation
yields equilibria that are more beneficial for the society of agents. However,
for many games it is still an open question how much cooperation is actually
needed to ensure socially good equilibria. We contribute to this research
endeavor by analyzing the benefits of cooperation in a network formation game
that models the creation of communication networks via the interaction of
selfish agents. In our game, agents that correspond to nodes of a network can
buy incident edges of a given weighted host graph to increase their centrality
in the formed network. The cost of an edge is proportional to its length, and
both endpoints must agree and pay for an edge to be created. This setting is
known for having a high price of anarchy.
  To uncover the impact of cooperation, we investigate the price of anarchy of
our network formation game with respect to multiple solution concepts that
allow for varying amounts of cooperation. On the negative side, we show that on
host graphs with arbitrary edge weights even the strongest form of cooperation
cannot improve the price of anarchy. In contrast to this, as our main result,
we show that cooperation has a significant positive impact if the given host
graph has metric edge weights. For this, we prove asymptotically tight bounds
on the price of anarchy via a novel proof technique that might be of
independent interest and can be applied in other models with metric weights.

Conclusion: 成功在资本博弈中定义新的均衡概念，并建立与经典均衡概念的联系

Abstract: We examine formal games that we call "capital games" in which player payoffs
are known, but their payoffs are not guaranteed to be von Neumann-Morgenstern
utilities. In capital games, the dynamics of player payoffs determine their
utility functions. Different players can have different payoff dynamics. We
make no assumptions about where these dynamics come from, but implicitly assume
that they come from the players' actions and interactions over time. We define
an equilibrium concept called "growth equilibrium" and show a correspondence
between the growth equilibria of capital games and the Nash equilibria of
standard games.

### [89] [Optimizing What Matters: AUC-Driven Learning for Robust Neural Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00137)
*Nima Sheikholeslami,Erfan Hosseini,Patrice Bechard,Srivatsava Daruru,Sai Rajeswar*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 现有NCE目标函数有缺陷，引入MW损失函数，理论上能上界AUC，实验显示优于对比损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主导的NCE目标函数优化的代理与AUC无关，导致下游任务校准不佳和性能欠佳。

Method: 引入MW损失函数，最大化Mann - Whitney U统计量，最小化得分差异的二元交叉熵；推广ROC曲线和AUC用于评估检索器校准和排序质量。

Result: 使用MW损失函数训练的检索器在AUC和标准检索指标上始终优于对比方法。

Conclusion: MW损失函数是对比损失的经验上更优替代方案，能为高风险应用提供校准更好、更具判别力的检索器。

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

TL;DR: HLTCOE团队将PLAID、mT5重排序器、GPT - 4重排序器、分数融合和文档翻译应用于TREC 2024 NeuCLIR赛道，采用多种模型和训练技术，对报告生成进行系统组合实验，并提交了所有NeuCLIR任务的运行结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参与TREC 2024 NeuCLIR赛道，解决CLIR、MLIR新闻任务、技术文档任务和报告生成任务。

Method: 应用PLAID，使用多种模型和训练技术（TD、GD、MTD），进行分数融合和文档翻译；对报告生成进行系统组合实验，包括使用不同模型总结结果、验证组合结果、提取分组相关事实。

Result: 团队向所有NeuCLIR任务提交了运行结果。

Conclusion: 未在摘要中明确提及。

Abstract: The HLTCOE team applied PLAID, an mT5 reranker, GPT-4 reranker, score fusion,
and document translation to the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track. For PLAID we included
a variety of models and training techniques -- Translate Distill (TD), Generate
Distill (GD) and multi-lingual translate-distill (MTD). TD uses scores from the
mT5 model over English MS MARCO query-document pairs to learn how to score
query-document pairs where the documents are translated to match the CLIR
setting. GD follows TD but uses passages from the collection and queries
generated by an LLM for training examples. MTD uses MS MARCO translated into
multiple languages, allowing experiments on how to batch the data during
training. Finally, for report generation we experimented with system
combination over different runs. One family of systems used either GPT-4o or
Claude-3.5-Sonnet to summarize the retrieved results from a series of
decomposed sub-questions. Another system took the output from those two models
and verified/combined them with Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The other family used GPT4o
and GPT3.5Turbo to extract and group relevant facts from the retrieved
documents based on the decomposed queries. The resulting submissions directly
concatenate the grouped facts to form the report and their documents of origin
as the citations. The team submitted runs to all NeuCLIR tasks: CLIR and MLIR
news tasks as well as the technical documents task and the report generation
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分探索学习增强数据结构的隐私和安全影响，数据结构在安全漏洞时应尽量少暴露信息，学习增强数据结构需更强保障。

Method: 提出阈值化技术让学习增强数据结构更鲁棒，配对技术在动态环境中实现强历史独立性。

Result: 实验表明安全和效率存在权衡，但结果仍与现有技术相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习增强数据结构在隐私和安全保障方面迈出第一步，虽有安全与效率权衡但有竞争力。

Abstract: Learning-augmented data structures use predicted frequency estimates to
retrieve frequently occurring database elements faster than standard data
structures. Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit
these frequency estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial
prediction errors. However, the privacy and security implications of this
setting remain largely unexplored.
  In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal
information beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for
learning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data
structure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no
information about past operations except what is inferred from its current
contents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security
guarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data
structure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic
updates.
  To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which
automatically makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing,
a simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic
setting. Our experimental results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and
efficiency but are still competitive with the state of the art.

TL;DR: 提出MILCO LSR架构，结合特殊训练机制和LexEcho头，实现多语言和跨语言LSR的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) 方法难以扩展到英语以外的语言，且投影到英语时会丢失不常见实体。

Method: 通过多语言连接器将不同语言的查询和文档映射到共享英语词汇空间，采用两阶段训练制度，提出LexEcho头增强鲁棒性。

Result: MILCO在标准多语言基准测试中优于领先的密集、稀疏和多向量基线，支持动态效率。

Conclusion: MILCO是一种有效的多语言和跨语言LSR架构，能解决现有方法的问题。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with
the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale
beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and
documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a
multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime
that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide
representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic
collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost
when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances
robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a
source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves
state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming
leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and
Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic
efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to
reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO
560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

Motivation: 图感知自适应检索需要预计算文档相似度图，该图常不可用或有二次内存成本；无图重排器需大语言模型调用。

Method: 引入L2G框架，将重排器信号转换为图结构。

Result: 在TREC - DL和BEIR子集上，L2G效果与基于oracle的图方法相当，且无额外大语言模型调用。

Conclusion: L2G能实现可扩展的基于图的检索，避免显式图计算的开销。

Abstract: Reranker improves retrieval performance by capturing document interactions.
At one extreme, graph-aware adaptive retrieval (GAR) represents an
information-rich regime, requiring a pre-computed document similarity graph in
reranking. However, as such graphs are often unavailable, or incur quadratic
memory costs even when available, graph-free rerankers leverage large language
model (LLM) calls to achieve competitive performance. We introduce L2G, a novel
framework that implicitly induces document graphs from listwise reranker logs.
By converting reranker signals into a graph structure, L2G enables scalable
graph-based retrieval without the overhead of explicit graph computation.
Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR subset show that L2G matches the effectiveness
of oracle-based graph methods, while incurring zero additional LLM calls.

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

Result: 模型表明堆叠自动编码器适用于表示学习中的聚类任务，能显著改善聚类搜索结果，提升搜索结果的准确性和相关性。

Conclusion: 使用堆叠自动编码器进行表示学习适合聚类任务，可有效提升阿拉伯语聚合搜索环境下的聚类搜索效果。

Abstract: Due to an information explosion on the internet, there is a need for the
development of aggregated search systems that can boost the retrieval and
management of content in various formats. To further improve the clustering of
Arabic text data in aggregated search environments, this research investigates
the application of advanced natural language processing techniques, namely
stacked autoencoders and AraBERT embeddings. By transcending the limitations of
traditional search engines, which are imprecise, not contextually relevant, and
not personalized, we offer more enriched, context-aware characterizations of
search results, so we used a K-means clustering algorithm to discover
distinctive features and relationships in these results, we then used our
approach on different Arabic queries to evaluate its effectiveness. Our model
illustrates that using stacked autoencoders in representation learning suits
clustering tasks and can significantly improve clustering search results. It
also demonstrates improved accuracy and relevance of search results.

Result: 发布了2.5亿参数的紧凑视觉语言编码器ModernVBERT，在文档检索任务微调后性能优于大10倍的模型。

Conclusion: 通过实验确定的关键因素可有效改进视觉文档检索模型。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models are gaining prevalence, notably for document
retrieval as efficient alternatives to text-only pipelines. These models are
typically built by finetuning large vision-language decoders (VLMs) with
contrastive losses on text-image pairs. In this work, we show that, while
cost-efficient, this repurposing approach often bottlenecks retrieval
performance. Through controlled experiments, we establish a principled recipe
for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact
of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and
late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central
performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a
compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms models up to 10
times larger when finetuned on document retrieval tasks. Models and code are
made available at https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT.

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供构建更强大测试套件的工具，提高系统可靠性，可扩展到识别不一致文档等应用。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Motivation: 现有transformer扩展推理计算的方法不能用于预训练且局限于串行自然语言表达，需改进。

Method: 提出Thoughtbubbles，在潜在空间通过学习分叉或删除残差流进行并行自适应计算，仅用语言建模损失在预训练时学习。

Result: Thoughtbubbles在OpenWebText和peS2o困惑度及零样本评估中优于标准解码器LM和非自适应并行计算方法。

Conclusion: 该方法的隐式特性使自适应计算能从预训练开始学习，为统一推理模型训练和测试行为奠定基础。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Motivation: 当前先进模型通过等变神经网络架构强制旋转平移对称性，导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Result: 在机器学习力场中与先进等变基线性能相当，比数据增强基线在不同大小OMol25数据集上性能提升40% - 60%。

Conclusion: 学习得到的等变性是等变或基于增强的MLIP模型的强大高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决RoPE位置插值（PI）与后训练量化（PTQ）结合时导致的精度下降问题。

Method: 对PI + PTQ方法进行系统分析，引入插值压力和尾部膨胀率两个诊断指标，提出Q - ROAR方法，分组RoPE维度，根据诊断指标在小长文本开发集上搜索每频段的缩放比例。

Result: Q - ROAR使模型在长文本工作负载上的困惑度降低超14%，保留了短文本性能、推理吞吐量和与现有LLM系统栈的兼容性。

Conclusion: Q - ROAR是一种有效的量化大语言模型的位置插值稳定方法。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

Conclusion: G2R是有效的图相似度计算方法，能提供图相似度的整体评估。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

Conclusion: p - adic度量对处理机器学习中分层数据结构可能是基础性的，分层数据中选实际观测点作代表更合理

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Conclusion: PANORAMA方法有效解决了ANNS验证瓶颈，能提升现有ANNS方法的性能。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Motivation: 联邦学习在表格数据跨客户端异构时，不同模式和特征空间阻碍直接聚合，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出FedLLM - Align框架，用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，将表格记录序列化文本，用模型嵌入提供语义对齐表示，支持标准FedAvg协议下的轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测实验中，各客户端设置和大语言模型骨干下，方法均优于现有基线，F1得分最多提升0.25，通信成本降低65%，极端模式差异下仍能正常工作。

Conclusion: FedLLM - Align是异构环境下联邦学习的强大、隐私保护和通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Conclusion: S - SWIM算法是一种有效的SNNs训练方法，在时间序列预测等任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法在准确性、可扩展性和能源效率上表现良好。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

Conclusion: 奖励选择是有限反馈下扩展强化学习的有力范式。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative

Method: 逆向工程分析成功学习乘法的隐式思维链模型，包括使用对数归因和线性探针；引入辅助损失预测“运行和”。

Result: 发现模型编码长程依赖的结构、机制和几何特征；标准微调模型收敛到缺乏长程依赖的局部最优；辅助损失使模型成功学习多位数乘法。

Conclusion: 逆向工程揭示Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱，正确归纳偏置可解决该问题。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在运行时开销大、无法并发微调多个独立LoRA适配器的问题，需提高效率。

Method: 在核层面提出图分裂方法融合内存操作；在调度层面引入自适应批处理算法进行多任务微调。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion有效解决了现有LoRA微调系统的低效问题，提升了微调效率。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA是一种有效的参数高效微调方法，能通过结构化剪枝获得灵活自适应的低秩适配器，且基于梯度的剪枝更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

Conclusion: 所提出算法在不同延迟场景下有效。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Conclusion: GRPO-λ能增强大语言模型在复杂推理任务强化学习微调中的信用分配，有效提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务实验中，多数情况下该方法的测试对数损失低于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在小验证集上微调影响最大的训练样本，对降低目标分布的测试损失最有益，所提方法有效。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Directed - MAML能解决MAML的局限，且任务导向近似可用于其他元学习算法提高性能。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

Method: 识别陷阱，以系统提示泄漏为例进行实证研究，分析提示泄漏的因素，提出改进KV缓存淘汰策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩时性能下降快，确定压缩方法、指令顺序和KV淘汰偏差是提示泄漏的因素。

Conclusion: 提出对KV缓存淘汰策略的简单修改，可减少不利因素影响，提升多指令任务性能。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Conclusion: EF21 - Muon是高效的分布式优化器，能有效解决通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Result: DIANO能在潜空间求解PDE，实现维度和几何降维，且潜空间具有可解释性。

Conclusion: DIANO在处理高维时空流数据的降维和潜空间可解释性方面表现良好。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

Motivation: 解决传统分类器自由指导（CFG）中使用大的静态权重改善视觉效果但分布对齐差的问题，更好近似目标条件分布。

Method: 学习指导权重ω_{c,(s,t)}，使其成为条件c、去噪起始时间t和目标时间s的连续函数，通过最小化真实条件分布噪声样本和引导扩散过程样本的分布不匹配来实现；扩展框架到奖励引导采样。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习指导权重的方法有效，能提升条件扩散模型样本质量和分布对齐。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Motivation: 深度学习训练算法通常只处理小批量样本的平均梯度，计算其他统计信息被认为资源消耗大，作者想要改变这一现状。

Method: 通过自动微分图的手术实现梯度统计，利用JAX的矢量化变换进行原型设计和实验，从逐样本梯度变换角度研究优化中的非线性操作。

Result: 梯度统计实现开销小；signSGD中符号操作的最优位置可由信噪比预测；Adam预调节器由梯度分布均值主导时优化效果最佳。

Conclusion: 逐样本梯度信息为算法设计带来新的分析和可能性。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

TL;DR: 研究挑战了监督微调（SFT）不如强化学习（RL）的观点，指出通过引入提示多样性和思维链监督，SFT可实现强大泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视普遍认为SFT无法泛化而RL更具鲁棒性的观点。

Method: 在两个决策基准上进行系统评估，引入提示多样性训练SFT模型，使用思维链监督提升迁移能力。

Result: 引入提示多样性使SFT对未见指令变体泛化能力增强；思维链监督改善SFT向更难任务的迁移；结合两者能在不同设置下实现鲁棒泛化，效果与RL相当或更好。

Conclusion: SFT并非天生不如RL，合适数据下普通SFT可与RL有同样强的泛化能力。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，VAE可构建低维表示，但性能依赖非近视设计选择，常通过试错和经验分析优化，需要实现自动化无偏优化。

Method: 以压电力显微镜数据为模型系统，研究基于奖励策略评估潜在空间表示，考察多种策略和奖励函数。

Conclusion: 用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间为构建奖励函数提供有力基础，可指导搜索最优简约表示。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Method: 受通用编码计算启发，设计编码平滑模块并集成到标准训练和推理流程。

Result: 在有监督和无监督任务的大量实验中，编码平滑模块持续提升泛化能力，在基于梯度的对抗攻击中达到了最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是一种有效且高效的正则化机制，可提升模型泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 延迟训练注意力层策略能有效解决混合模型长度泛化问题。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

Conclusion: 控制预训练分布的关键统计特性对构建具有上下文学习能力和可靠的大语言模型至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Motivation: VAE生成的样本模糊且不一致，存在“先验空洞”问题，需要一个灵活且能快速生成样本的先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，所提出的EVaLP方法在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面有所改进。

Conclusion: 基于能量的变分潜在先验（EVaLP）方法有效解决了VAE的先验问题，提升了图像生成性能。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前逻辑规则方法将规则视为通用，赋予固定置信分数，忽略查询特定上下文，而规则重要性会随查询变化。

Method: 引入SLogic框架，其核心是利用以查询头实体为中心的子图的评分函数，动态评估每条规则的重要性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic始终优于包括基于嵌入和基于规则的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: SLogic框架通过考虑查询依赖的规则得分，在知识图谱补全任务中取得更好效果。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

Result: 证明WN与黎曼优化能实现线性收敛，相比不使用WN的标准方法有指数级加速，迭代和样本复杂度随过参数化程度增加而多项式改善。

Conclusion: 本工作首次刻画了WN如何利用过参数化在矩阵感知中实现更快收敛。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Result: 应用Freedave，在数学推理任务上可将DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍且不降低性能。

Conclusion: Freedave算法能有效提升DLLMs的推理效率，且不会造成性能损失。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Conclusion: 提出的结合对抗训练和测试时鲁棒聚合的方法能有效增强非线性聚合器鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Motivation: 互联网数据增长推动人工智能等发展，需开发最优机器学习算法选择框架以解决各领域问题。

Method: 将机器学习算法分为急切、懒惰和混合学习者，根据数据集属性、性能指标和AIC分数选择算法，用八个数据集验证。

Conclusion: 此方法弥补自动模型选择差距，对跨学科机器学习部署有实际意义。

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer训练时无跳跃连接很困难，跳跃连接虽稳定优化但破坏表征层次结构，需探索无跳跃连接下的高效训练方法。

Method: 分析无跳跃连接的Transformer块的雅可比矩阵，提出一种原则性的初始化策略。

Result: 在有监督和自监督设置的ViT上验证，无跳跃连接的ViT克服优化障碍，学习到更丰富层次表征，在密集预测基准上优于含跳跃连接的基线模型。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接并非训练ViT的基本要求，为视觉模型分层表征学习开辟新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Motivation: 现有DPT训练方法难以在预训练数据分布之外泛化，需探索缓解方法。

Method: 提出上下文好奇心作为离线预训练正则化器，引入PPT框架，用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号鼓励探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机实验中，PPT表现出更好的鲁棒性，缓解了DPT在测试环境奖励方差高时的性能下降。

Conclusion: 尽管离线数据质量很重要，但基于好奇心的预训练为提升上下文强化学习代理的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

Motivation: CMDP因缺乏通用最优策略，初始分布变化时需重新求解，需分析最优值随初始分布的变化。

Method: 使用CMDP对偶分析和线性规划扰动分析推导变化界限。

Result: 得出CMDP最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Conclusion: 该界限可用于分析因初始分布未知变化导致的给定策略的遗憾。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质结构分词方法难优化和扩展，需更好方案。

Method: 提出基于流的分词器Kanzi，由带流匹配损失的扩散自编码器组成。

Result: 简化操作，稳定训练参数高效模型，重建指标超现有分词器，自回归模型表现好但未超最优连续扩散模型。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化蛋白质结构分词器操作，在一定程度上表现优异。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

Motivation: 现有生成框架在多目标生物分子序列设计上存在不足，连续空间框架多为单目标，离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优保证。

Method: 基于 Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合 Tchebycheff 标量化、局部平衡提议和退火 Metropolis - Hastings 更新。

Result: 应用于肽和 SMILES 序列设计，可同时优化多达五个治疗特性，优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi 是强大的多属性生物分子生成序列框架。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Motivation: 持续学习中因任务间分布变化而复杂，需解决可塑性损失和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值，保留变压器架构核心归纳偏置。

Result: 该机制显著缓解问题，优于选择性重新初始化等基线，通过初步Hessian谱分析发现保持高曲率秩的模型倾向保留可塑性。

Conclusion: 在持续学习中，全注意力对于获取元学习益处并非必要。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

literature where key results are scattered across numerous papers. In
particular, we synthesize this disparate body of findings into a curated set of

Conclusion: GDLNN在图分类任务中有良好表现，具备高可解释性和低成本的优势。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

Result: 两种方法在年轻成人队列中表现相当，AM揭示空间负载和特征绑定相互作用的个体差异，且估计收敛更快，约30个样本就能准确拟合全模型。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法有效，在工作记忆研究中有优势。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Method: 设计模块化混合模型架构搜索框架Composer，小规模探索模型架构，用提出的缩放策略将表现优的架构扩展到更大规模。

Result: 发现新混合大语言模型架构，在3.5亿 - 30亿参数规模下降低验证损失，下游任务评估准确率提升2.8 - 8.3%（平均1.1 - 3.1%），提高训练与推理效率。

Conclusion: Composer框架有效，能发现性能更优的混合模型架构。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升学习PTNs的效率。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: MS - PHS GP在学习物理一致动力学和哈密顿量后验方面有效。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse

under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate
estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE
adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random

These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVMs cross-task inference
with DALEs optimal adaptive sampling, providing a principled basis for more
efficient cognitive assessments.

Motivation: Mamba模型虽有计算优势且有上下文学习能力，但因门控机制非线性，理论理解有限，故开展对其训练动态及上下文学习泛化能力的理论分析。

Method: 对单层Mamba模型进行理论分析，该模型由线性注意力组件和非线性门控层组成，还与相同设置下的线性Transformer进行比较分析。

Conclusion: 理论分析揭示了Mamba模型在训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力方面的特性，且实验支持了理论结果。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

Motivation: 现有基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在编码时图对规模差异、距离度量缺乏区分度等问题，影响匹配效果和排名应用。

Method: 提出NC - Iso架构，构建节点根子树内相邻层级的层次依赖关系以保留特征相对位置；引入相似度优势比率增强度量来提升匹配对排名能力。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实验验证了NC - Iso的有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性、可迁移性以及时间效率。

Conclusion: NC - Iso为子图检索提供了更具区分性的神经子图匹配解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出用于微调大语言模型的基于学习的零阶优化器ZO Fine - tuner，实验显示其性能和可扩展性良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶方法依赖手工静态采样策略，无法适应特定模型结构，且观察到实践中基础模型及导数使用较少，期望学习一次优化器并跨下游任务复用。

Method: 设计ZO Fine - tuner，通过紧凑且内存高效的设计自动学习高效扰动策略，支持每个大语言模型一次性训练。

Result: 在4个大语言模型和7个数据集实验中，ZO Fine - tuner在82.1%的任务 - 模型组合中优于先前零阶基线。

Conclusion: ZO Fine - tuner在高效微调大语言模型方面表现出强大性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Method: 提出C - SRRG方法，整合多视图X射线图像、临床指征、成像技术和既往研究等丰富临床上下文，构建C - SRRG数据集。

Conclusion: C - SRRG方法在放射报告生成中具有有效性，公开的数据、代码和检查点将有助于未来临床对齐的自动RRG研究。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

TL;DR: 提出PromptLoop框架解决扩散模型微调问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的扩散模型微调存在泛化、组合性和抗奖励作弊问题，现有提示细化方法未充分利用强化学习顺序性。

Method: 引入Plug - and - play的PromptLoop框架，用强化学习训练多模态大语言模型基于扩散模型中间隐状态迭代更新提示。

Result: 在不同奖励函数和扩散主干上实验表明，PromptLoop能有效优化奖励、无缝泛化到未见模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合、减轻过优化和奖励作弊。

Conclusion: PromptLoop是一个有效的解决扩散模型微调问题的框架，兼具灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

TL;DR: 提出样本感知动态增强方法SADA，根据样本对模型优化的影响调整增强强度，实验显示其有效实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法未考虑动态训练环境中样本难度与模型泛化能力的变化，导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，降低训练效果。

Method: 引入SADA，通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差来估计样本影响，对低方差样本强增强，对不稳定样本弱增强，且该方法轻量级，可即插即用。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上实验，SADA在细粒度任务上提升7.3%，在长尾数据集上提升4.3%。

Conclusion: SADA方法有效且实用。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Motivation: 现有XAI方法存在细节与可解释性的权衡，LRP实现依赖未优化的启发式规则集。

Method: 应用CMA - ES根据定量可解释性指标（如忠实性或稀疏性）调整LRP超参数。

Result: EVO - LRP在可解释性指标表现和视觉一致性上优于传统XAI方法，对特定类特征有强敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过有原则的、特定任务的优化可以系统地提高归因质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Conclusion: 草图化激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法常混淆时变和时不变成分，面对分布变化表现不佳。

Result: 在真实数据集上 TimeEmb 优于现有基线模型，所需计算资源少，综合分析验证了静 - 动分离的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeEmb 是有效的轻量级框架，可简单集成以改进现有时间序列预测方法。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

Result: 在两个基准测试上的大量实验结果证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的无排练和无任务的在线持续学习方法（F2OCL）能有效解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 探索能揭示训练好的神经网络使用特征的方法，以及检测模型相变的手段。

Method: 对两个用于机制可解释性的标准玩具模型（TMS和单层MLP）进行eNTK特征分析。

Result: eNTK呈现尖锐谱悬崖，其顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐；在TMS中能在稀疏和密集状态下恢复真实特征；在模运算中可恢复傅里叶特征族；逐层eNTK可将特征定位到特定层，eNTK特征谱演化可诊断突现相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为小模型的特征发现和相变检测提供了实用方法。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络利用捷径特征会破坏鲁棒性，在持续学习中其后果会持续和加剧，需评估真正的迁移和由线索夸大的性能。

Method: 引入Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)指标，包含Adaptation Delay (AD)、Performance Deficit (PD)和Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel)三个方面；在有虚假洋红色补丁的CIFAR - 100持续学习基准上评估多种持续学习方法。

Result: 持续学习方法比Scratch - T2基线更早达到准确率阈值，但在有补丁的捷径类上最终准确率略低；屏蔽补丁提高CL方法准确率，降低Scratch - T2准确率，补丁对CL模型是干扰。

Conclusion: ERI指标可用于评估持续学习中真正的迁移和线索夸大的性能，补丁在该设置下对CL模型是干扰而非捷径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型（LDMs）在判别式迁移方面潜力未被充分挖掘，要解决无源领域自适应的核心挑战。

Method: 将源特征标签信息编码到其潜在邻域，适应时从目标特征潜在邻域采样，用扩散模块生成源特征线索，用InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Conclusion: DVD将LDMs重新解释为实用、保护隐私的显式知识转移桥梁，解决了无源领域自适应的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

Motivation: 现有黑盒域适应（BBDA）工作多针对视觉应用，不适用于有独特时空特征的时间序列应用，且未探索基础模型在BBTSDA中的优势。

Method: 构建双分支网络结构的CPFM，每个分支有独特提示以捕捉数据分布特征，在域适应阶段开展提示和输入级别的重建学习，基于时间序列基础模型克服时空动态。

Result: 在三个不同应用领域的时间序列数据集上，CPFM取得显著优于竞争对手的结果。

Conclusion: CPFM在黑盒时间序列域适应问题上具有优势。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Conclusion: DAV框架有效，可解决现有扩散对齐方法的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Motivation: 探究DA在对抗扰动下的特性，明确其优缺点。

Method: 进行理论分析，识别负梯度对齐为敏感性放大的关键驱动；在ViT/DiffViT上进行系统实验，评估预训练的CLIP/DiffCLIP。

Result: DA比标准注意力有更高攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强局部敏感性；堆叠DA层能减弱小扰动，但大攻击预算下保护作用消失。

Conclusion: DA在干净输入上提高判别焦点，但增加对抗脆弱性，未来注意力机制需兼顾选择性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: 研究FFN宽度选择，发现不对称光谱缩放定律，为高效推理的大语言模型设计提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律忽略组件对潜在空间的利用，需研究如何有效利用大语言模型的容量。

Method: 将FFN宽度选择视为光谱利用问题，使用Hard Rank、Soft Rank等诊断套件量化模型潜在方向的激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称光谱缩放定律，宽化FFN主要增加低能量尾部方向，主导模式子空间过早饱和，潜在空间利用率低。

Conclusion: FFN宽度选择是尾部容量和主导模式容量的权衡，为高效推理的大语言模型设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测预期寿命具有挑战性，需评估不同模型来提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用来自WHO和UN的真实数据集，对三种模型（LR、RDT、RF）进行评估，用R²、MAE和RMSE评估性能，通过p值和特征重要性指标确保可解释性。

Result: RF预测准确性最高（R² = 0.9423），显著优于LR和RDT，发现免疫率和人口属性是关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: 强调集成方法和透明度在解决公共卫生挑战中的协同作用，建议未来探索先进插补策略、替代算法和更新数据。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型强化学习训练中参数动态尚不清楚，需深入研究。

Method: 识别强化学习引起的参数更新的两个基本属性，通过跨8个大语言模型和7种算法的实验验证，并基于发现提出AlphaRL框架。

Result: Rank - 1 Dominance可恢复超99%性能提升，Rank - 1 Linear Dynamics能从早期检查点准确预测，AlphaRL实现2.5倍加速并保留超96%推理性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果是大规模强化学习的实用工具，为大语言模型训练开辟了有原则、可解释和高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Result: 成功学习需要初始记忆结构尽可能长，固定循环权重比调整循环权重更有优势，收敛更快且性能相当或更高。

Conclusion: 为SSMs提供新的理论基础，可能带来新的优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，对每个目标短语优化投毒文档成本高。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和聚焦区域，引导与攻击成功强相关的注意力头。

Result: 在18种端到端RAG设置中，平均攻击成功率从21.9提高到57.8；单个优化吸引器可转移到未见黑盒模型。

Conclusion: 建立了RAG数据投毒的可扩展范式，模块化可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，揭示了注意力集中与模型输出的联系。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Result: 选择性缩放结合提前时间条件可减少模型校准误差且不降低预报质量。

Conclusion: 新指标和后处理技术有助于解决神经天气模型降水概率预报的校准问题。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

Conclusion: 结合结构方程设计模糊集的方法有效，在多种情况下表现良好，解决了相关问题。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

Conclusion: 有安全保证的分布式学习在合理连接网络中可实现近最优性能。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

Result: 在合成和真实世界的函数回归基准测试中，FAME达到了最先进的精度，对函数的任意采样离散观测具有很强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME是一个有效的端到端、全数据驱动的函数对函数回归框架。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Result: 该方法在预测准确性上与最先进方法相当，且具有基于物理的可解释参数化。

Conclusion: 随机过程理论和深度学习的结合为复杂系统中生存现象建模提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

Conclusion: TD - JEPA是一种有效的无监督强化学习方法，能实现测试时任意奖励函数的零样本优化。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域影响，微调后的基础模型在处理未见的真实世界时间序列数据时，相对于专用小模型，在参数和内存占用增加的情况下，效果并非始终显著更好。

Conclusion: 时间序列数据因自身多样性，不太适合构建有效的基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Conclusion: LEAP编码可作为图表示学习管道的强大组件。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Result: 在多种推理密集型基准测试中，原地反馈表现优于传统多轮反馈，且减少79.1%的令牌使用；控制环境分析表明原地反馈解决了多轮反馈的核心局限。

Conclusion: 原地反馈为引导大语言模型进行推理密集型任务提供了更自然有效的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Motivation: 复杂系统产生的模式多样性有科学和艺术用途，但探索时面临参数空间大、映射非线性以及要考虑用户对特定模式的期望等挑战。

Method: 提供设计选择及实现，通过用户以系统无关方式制定显式约束来进行交互式系统探索。

Result: 能以样本高效的方式在用户感兴趣区域实现模式多样性最大化，同时保持全局多样性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可应对复杂系统探索的挑战，实现约束下的模式多样性。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to
guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging
Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently
outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results
emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular
fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动指导，在不牺牲多样性的前提下增强了利用能力。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

Conclusion: CAPO算法有效解决了策略梯度优化稳定性问题，显著提升了大语言模型推理的样本效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在大语言模型路由问题上表现良好，有更好的性能和成本平衡。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Conclusion: 建议该领域常规报告稳定性指标，以推动更严谨和基于统计的可解释性科学发展。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

Method: 对CQF方法进行分析，对比用CQF训练的模型与在通过随机令牌排列获得的不同质量合成数据上训练的模型的表现。

Result: CQF能提升下游任务性能，但不一定增强高质量数据集的语言建模，且与合成数据训练模型表现趋势不同。

Conclusion: 挑战了CQF能捕捉有意义的数据质量概念这一观点。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

Conclusion: GLAI建立新设计原则，为大规模架构集成提供新方向。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

Motivation: 现有均值方法如GRPO存在熵坍塌和推理增益有限问题，原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略稀有推理路径。

Method: 提出Risk - based Policy Optimization (RiskPO)，用风险度量替代经典均值目标，引入混合风险价值目标，设计捆绑方案聚合问题。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中取得显著一致的改进，在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上超越GRPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了严谨有效的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 许多RLVR系统将奖励设为二进制以减少验证器被攻击的漏洞，但会引入假阴性和假阳性问题，需解决验证器不可靠问题。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，推导向后和向前两种校正算法，并在基于GRPO的RLVR管道中实现，同时展示实用申诉机制。

Result: 两种校正算法均优于未校正训练，向前校正收敛更快且在高噪声下更稳定，申诉机制比其他先进方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 所提出的校正算法和申诉机制能有效解决RLVR中验证器不可靠问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Conclusion: RECAP方法能有效提升大推理模型安全对齐能力，即使多次尝试覆盖推理也能保持安全。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Result: 2 - GRPO性能与16 - GRPO相当，仅使用1/8的样本且训练时间减少超70%。

Conclusion: 挑战了GRPO需大组规模训练的假设，2 - GRPO在减少计算开销的同时能达到良好性能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Conclusion: RCM能在尊重黎曼几何内在流形约束的同时实现少步一致性建模，为黎曼流形上的生成建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Result: 在不同基准和模型架构上的大量实验表明，ARM能持续提升大语言模型在推理任务上的性能，且只需几行简单代码。

Conclusion: 解释了无意义令牌的好处，提出利用激活重分配提升大语言模型性能的简单有效技术。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Result: CurES在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO高3.30分和4.82分，且收敛速度比包括GRPO在内的基线方法更快。

Conclusion: 提出的CurES方法能有效提升大语言模型在推理任务上的训练效率。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

Conclusion: Gated X - TFC为PINNs提供了简单替代方案，在边界层问题上准确且计算高效。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for

appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Method: 通过内在维度视角分析模型，在控制任务和合成数据集上估计最后一层特征和回归目标的内在维度并比较。

Conclusion: 为神经回归提供新几何见解，提出增强泛化的实用策略。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型无法处理文本，大语言模型难以处理数值时间序列，需结合两者优势。

Method: 通过基于补丁的编解码器架构为大语言模型增加时间序列感知能力，在超200万个时间序列和文本示例的语料库上训练TsLLM。

Result: TsLLM在结合时间序列分析与自然语言的任务上表现出色，但在传统基准测试中未超越专业模型。

Conclusion: 建立了连接数值计算和自然语言理解的时间序列分析新范式，通过自然语言交互普及复杂时间推理。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物识别数据敏感，集中训练有隐私风险，传统联邦学习存在可解释性和处理非IID数据的问题，因此需要新方法处理非IID生物识别数据。

Method: 在中央服务器添加注意力机制，根据本地模型更新的重要性进行加权；使用差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据并保证准确性；用Siamese - CNN提取特征。

Result: A3 - FL框架在准确率、收敛速度和鲁棒性上优于标准FL（FedAvg）和静态基线，基于注意力机制方法准确率达0.8413，使用差分隐私时准确率仍达0.8330。

Conclusion: 提出了适用于分散环境的可扩展且注重隐私的生物识别系统。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Motivation: 现有时间序列模型无法完成复杂数值时间序列分析所需的多步推理，大语言模型在时间序列任务上表现不佳。

Method: 引入COUNTS框架，用残差向量量化VAE创建离散令牌，采用两阶段训练过程，包括监督微调与组相对策略优化训练。

Result: 基于强化学习和中间思维链推理的方法显著提升了大语言模型在各种时间序列分析任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂时间数据推理开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效捕捉重要序列相关性，提高分类准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的转换到双曲面空间的方法可有效分析生物序列关系，提升分类效果。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

Method: 提出PDR推理方法，包括并行生成多样草稿、蒸馏到有限文本工作区、基于工作区细化输出；用强化学习训练8B思维模型使其推理方法与PDR一致。

Result: PDR实例比长思维链准确率更高、延迟更低；Sequential Refinement (SR)性能优于长思维链；迭代管道在数学任务上超越单遍基线，PDR增益最大。

Conclusion: PDR方法在准确率和延迟上有优势，模型编排的成功引发进一步训练能否改变帕累托前沿的思考。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Conclusion: 将研究结果提炼成训练配方，指导三支柱协同设计。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练大语言模型对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，需确定最佳训练批量大小和关注中间难度提示的重要性。

Result: PCL性能最优或达相近性能耗时更少，比基于滚动的过滤方法识别提示速度快，值模型能准确预测提示难度。

Conclusion: 提出新方法，在推理强化学习中实现性能上限和效率的更好权衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Motivation: 现实表格数据常存在缺失值，简单插补策略有缺陷，需要高质量、鲁棒且推理快的插补器。

Method: 引入基于自动解码器的隐式神经表示框架TabINR，使用可学习的行和特征嵌入处理表格数据离散结构，可从部分观测中推理。

Result: 在12个真实数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，插补准确性高，多数情况下匹配或超越经典和深度学习模型，在高维数据集上优势明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架能有效处理表格数据缺失值问题，插补效果良好。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Motivation: 解决使用DP - SGD进行大语言模型差分隐私微调时样本效率低的问题，DP - SGD添加的噪声增加梯度矩阵熵，破坏低秩结构，减慢优化。

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可在不损害隐私保证的情况下提高私有语言模型训练的实用性。

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

Conclusion: M2PO算法能有效解决陈旧数据问题，实现稳定的离线策略训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实金融数据在数量、质量和多样性上存在不足，阻碍机器学习模型性能，需生成方法缓解数据短缺。

Method: 引入时间序列数据生成技术Fiaingen，并从三方面评估其性能。

Result: Fiaingen方法在三方面达到先进水平，合成数据接近原始数据，生成时间短，用其训练的模型性能接近真实数据训练的。

Conclusion: Fiaingen方法有效，能缓解金融数据短缺问题，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有示例搜索方法仅关注预测准确性，忽略了模型校准这一影响可信度和安全部署的关键因素。

Method: 将示例选择表述为多目标优化问题，用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法（COM - BOM）寻找帕累托前沿。

Result: 在不饱和MMLU - Pro基准的多个任务上评估，COM - BOM在联合优化预测准确性和校准误差两个目标上优于或等同于基线方法，且所需大语言模型API调用次数最少。

Conclusion: COM - BOM算法在示例选择的多目标优化问题上有效，能在保证准确性的同时提高模型校准度，且调用成本低。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了最大公开可用的工具代理数据集Toucan，其能生成多样、逼真且具挑战性的任务，模型在Toucan上微调后表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区因缺乏高质量、许可宽松的工具代理训练数据而发展受限，现有数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面不足。

Method: 利用真实的模型上下文协议（MCP）环境，通过五个不同模型生成工具使用查询，应用基于模型的质量过滤，用两个代理框架和三个教师模型生成代理轨迹，还有严格的验证和三种扩展机制。

Result: 模型在Toucan上微调后，在BFCL V3基准测试中优于更大的闭源模型，推动了MCP-Universe Bench的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集能有效解决现有工具代理训练数据的问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出BroRL方法，通过增加每个示例的滚动次数来扩展强化学习，可突破ProRL性能瓶颈，实现持续性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ProRL在增加训练步骤数时性能达到平台期，投入更多计算资源进行额外训练的回报递减，因此探索一种互补的扩展强化学习的范式。

Method: 基于质量平衡方程分析，在更宽松条件下进行模拟验证理论分析，提出增加每个示例的滚动次数至数百次以进行全面探索的BroRL方法。

Result: 在3K ProRL训练步骤后饱和的模型中，BroRL使其恢复活力，实现稳健、持续的改进，在多个基准测试中使1.5B模型达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 增加每个示例的滚动次数的BroRL方法能突破ProRL的性能瓶颈，带来持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出一种控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型采样多样性的机制，可控制局部采样温度，无需微调或改变训练策略，在多个任务验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让用户能从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽泛的分布中采样，控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型的采样多样性。

Method: 基于模型利用噪声数据分布的（学习到的）得分函数进行采样的观察，通过重新缩放得分函数来控制局部采样温度。

Result: 在二维玩具数据上验证框架，在图像生成、姿态估计等五个不同任务中应用，能从更尖锐或更平坦分布采样，带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效控制模型采样多样性，适用于现成模型，在多个任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPSL正则化技术解决预训练模型升级为稀疏MoE时专家专业化不足问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练密集模型升级为稀疏MoE时因简单权重复制导致专家专业化差，传统正则化下路由表现不佳影响性能。

Method: 引入Dirichlet - Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)，通过匹配专家分配与目标狄利克雷先验直接塑造路由概率分布。

Result: 在升级的MoE视觉语言模型实验中，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准测试中始终优于其他升级策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL解决了专家专业化差的关键问题，能培养更自适应、高性能的模型，且是通用工具，可用于输出分类概率分布的模块。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

Conclusion: 所提出的技术能帮助分析多目标优化问题中目标间的局部和全局关系，了解问题难度。

Abstract: Understanding the relationships between objectives in a multiobjective
optimisation problem is important for developing tailored and efficient solving
techniques. In particular, when tackling combinatorial optimisation problems
with many objectives, that arise in real-world logistic scenarios, better
support for the decision maker can be achieved through better understanding of
the often complex fitness landscape. This paper makes a contribution in this
direction by presenting a technique that allows a visualisation and analysis of
the local and global relationships between objectives in optimisation problems
with many objectives. The proposed technique uses four steps: First, the global
pairwise relationships are analysed using the Kendall correlation method; then,
the ranges of the values found on the given Pareto front are estimated and
assessed; next, these ranges are used to plot a map using Gray code, similar to
Karnaugh maps, that has the ability to highlight the trade-offs between
multiple objectives; and finally, local relationships are identified using
scatter plots. Experiments are presented for three combinatorial optimisation
problems: multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem, multiobjective
nurse scheduling problem, and multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows . Results show that the proposed technique helps in the gaining of
insights into the problem difficulty arising from the relationships between
objectives.

Motivation: 大语言模型在无性能上下文时进行自动代码优化有困难，传统性能工具缺乏可执行建议。

Method: 引入Opal框架，将硬件计数器和Roofline分析的动态见解与停顿事件关联到优化决策。

Result: 在1640个实验中，超98.5%的情况单见解源就能提速，平均19.34% - 52.3%；提示模板几乎都能生成正确代码。

Conclusion: Opal通过性能分析和大语言模型自动优化GPU内核，向普及专家级性能工程迈进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for automated code optimization but
struggle without performance context. This work introduces Opal, a modular
framework that connects performance analytics insights with the vast body of
published by guiding LLMs to generate informed, trustworthy optimizations.
Unlike traditional performance tools that identify bottlenecks but stop short
of actionable suggestions, Opal bridges this long-standing gap by linking
dynamic insights from hardware counters and Roofline analysis to stall events
to optimization decisions. We evaluate Opal across 1640 experiments on
real-world GPU kernels and find that in over 98.5% of cases, even a single
insight source yields speedups, ranging on average from 19.34% to 52.3%. Our
prompt template produced correct code in all but one case, where a vague
diagnostic caused an unsafe suggestion. By automatically optimizing GPU kernels
using performance analytics and LLMs, Opal marks a leap toward democratizing
expert-level performance engineering for all.

Motivation: 弥合形式方法与实际开发实践的差距，解决可扩展的工业级全栈软件工程问题。

Method: 通过图论建模确保结构正确性，用统一状态机和CSP形式化PBFD和PDFD，提出TLE编码方案。

Result: PBFD企业部署开发速度比Salesforce OmniScript快20倍以上，查询性能比传统关系模型快7 - 8倍，PDFD实现证明其正确性优先原则。

Conclusion: PBFD和PDFD建立了可重现、透明的框架，集成形式验证到实际软件开发，相关资源公开以促进研究和应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces Primary Breadth-First Development (PBFD) and Primary
Depth-First Development (PDFD), two formally defined and verified methodologies
for scalable, industrial-grade full-stack software engineering. These
approaches bridge a longstanding gap between formal methods and real-world
development practice by enforcing structural correctness through
graph-theoretic modeling. Unlike prior graph-based approaches, PBFD and PDFD
operate over layered directed graphs and are formalized using unified state
machines and Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to ensure critical
properties, including bounded-refinement termination and structural
completeness. To coordinate hierarchical data at scale, we propose Three-Level
Encapsulation (TLE) - a novel, bitmask-based encoding scheme that delivers
provably constant-time updates. TLE's formal guarantees underpin PBFD's
industrial-scale performance and scalability. PBFD was empirically validated
through an eight-year enterprise deployment, demonstrating over 20x faster
development than Salesforce OmniScript and 7-8x faster query performance
compared to conventional relational models. Additionally, both methodologies
are supported by open-source MVPs, with PDFD's implementation conclusively
demonstrating its correctness-first design principles. Together, PBFD and PDFD
establish a reproducible, transparent framework that integrates formal
verification into practical software development. All formal specifications,
MVPs, and datasets are publicly available to foster academic research and
industrial-grade adoption.

Motivation: 随着可视化中显示的数据量增加，可视化本身可能难以理解，需要解决可视化可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出语义缩放方法，根据虚拟相机与视觉对象的距离改变软件景观的图形表示；用二维小地图增强可视化。通过开源工具ExplorViz实现。

Result: 两项用户研究表明语义缩放和小地图有用，尤其适用于大型软件景观和协作式软件探索，实现方法可用性良好。

Conclusion: 语义缩放和小地图是有用的补充，但实现有不足，需未来解决。

Abstract: Software visualization tools can facilitate program comprehension by
providing visual metaphors, or abstractions that reduce the amount of textual
data that needs to be processed mentally. One way they do this is by enabling
developers to build an internal representation of the visualized software and
its architecture. However, as the amount of displayed data in the visualization
increases, the visualization itself can become more difficult to comprehend.
The ability to display small and large amounts of data in visualizations is
called visual scalability.
  In this paper, we present two approaches to address the challenge of visual
scalability in 3D software cities. First, we present an approach to semantic
zoom, in which the graphical representation of the software landscape changes
based on the virtual camera's distance from visual objects. Second, we augment
the visualization with a miniature two-dimensional top-view projection called
mini-map. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source implementation in
our software visualization tool ExplorViz. ExplorViz is web-based and uses the
3D city metaphor, focusing on live trace visualization.
  We evaluated our approaches in two separate user studies. The results
indicate that semantic zoom and the mini-map are both useful additions. User
feedback indicates that semantic zoom and mini-maps are especially useful for
large software landscapes and collaborative software exploration. The studies
indicate a good usability of our implemented approaches. However, some
shortcomings in our implementations have also been discovered, to be addressed
in future work.

Abstract: Software visualization, which uses data from dynamic program analysis, can
help to explore and understand the behavior of software systems. It is common
that large software systems offer a web interface for user interaction.
Usually, available web interfaces are not regarded in software visualization
tools. This paper introduces additions to the web-based live tracing software
visualization tool ExplorViz: We add an embedded web view for instrumented
applications in the 3D visualization to ease interaction with the given
applications and enable the exploration of the thereby displayed HTML content.
Namely, the Document Object Model (DOM) is visualized via a three-dimensional
representation of the HTML structure in same-origin contexts.
  Our visualization approach is evaluated in a preliminary user study. The
study results give insights into the potential use cases, benefits, and
shortcomings of our implemented approach. Based on our study results, we
propose directions for further research to support the visual exploration of
web interfaces and explore use cases for the combined visualization of software
cities and HTML structure.

matrix-matrix multiplication code written in C to GPU code using CUDA. The
multi-agent configuration of VibeCodeHPC achieved higher-quality code

Motivation: Assurance 2.0存在信心测量、残余疑虑管理等方面的局限，需更好的方法应对。

Result: 以端到端基于AI的自动驾驶车辆开发为例，将开发分为三阶段，各阶段按产品开发生命周期进一步分解。

Conclusion: 该分解框架支持安全声明、证据和潜在反驳的细粒度可追溯性。

Abstract: Assurance 2.0 is a modern framework developed to address the assurance
challenges of increasingly complex, adaptive, and autonomous systems. Building
on the traditional Claims-Argument-Evidence (CAE) model, it introduces reusable
assurance theories and explicit counterarguments (defeaters) to enhance rigor,
transparency, and adaptability. It supports continuous, incremental assurance,
enabling innovation without compromising safety. However, limitations persist
in confidence measurement, residual doubt management, automation support, and
the practical handling of defeaters and confirmation bias. This paper presents
\textcolor{black}{a set of decomposition frameworks to identify a complete set
of safety arguments and measure their corresponding evidence.} Grounded in the
Assurance 2.0 paradigm, the framework is instantiated through a structured
template and employs a three-tiered decomposition strategy. \textcolor{black}{A
case study regarding the application of the decomposition framework in the
end-to-end (E2E) AI-based Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) development is also
presented in this paper.} At the top level, the SDV development is divided into
three critical phases: Requirements Engineering (RE), Verification and
Validation (VnV), and Post-Deployment (PD). Each phase is further decomposed
according to its Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC). To ensure comprehensive
coverage, each PDLC is analyzed using an adapted 5M1E model (Man, Machine,
Method, Material, Measurement, and Environment). Originally developed for
manufacturing quality control, the 5M1E model is reinterpreted and contextually
mapped to the assurance domain. This enables a multi-dimensional decomposition
that supports fine-grained traceability of safety claims, evidence, and
potential defeaters.

Motivation: 解决服务编排资源缺乏清晰性和标准化，导致最佳实践难以实施和行业采纳受限的问题。

Method: 分析现有文献和工具，确定常见编排实践。

Result: 定义了Preemptive Scheduling、Service Balancing和Garbage Collection三种编排资源优化模式。

Conclusion: 这些模式可作为改善编排实践和促进基于服务架构广泛采用的基础元素。

Abstract: Service-based architectures provide substantial benefits, yet service
orchestration remains a challenge, particularly for newcomers. While various
resources on orchestration techniques exist, they often lack clarity and
standardization, making best practices difficult to implement and limiting
their adoption within the software industry.
  To address this gap, we analyzed existing literature and tools to identify
common orchestration practices. Based on our findings, we define three key
orchestration resource optimization patterns: {\sc Preemptive Scheduling}, {\sc
Service Balancing}, and {\sc Garbage Collection}. {\sc Preemptive Scheduling}
allows the allocation of sufficient resources for services of higher priority
in stressful situations, while {\sc Service Balancing} enables a restructuring
of the nodes to allow better resource usage. To end, {\sc Garbage Collection}
creates cleanup mechanisms to better understand the system's resource usage and
optimize it. These patterns serve as foundational elements for improving
orchestration practices and fostering broader adoption in service-based
architectures.

Conclusion: 可利用检索器和编程语言的关联改善人机相关性判定，转译器可用于创建可扩展代码搜索基准数据集。

Abstract: Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of
better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software
maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite
improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code
search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for
code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general
text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a
programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering
knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code
search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse
vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations
across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We
focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be
implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several
LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities
between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that
can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations,
with significant performance implications. We also find differences in
representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human
and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap
scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study
demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst
case) human-human agreement under study. The application code used in this work
is available at \href{https://github.com/rlucas7/code-searcher/}{this github

*Ahmed Fawzy,Amjed Tahir,Kelly Blincoe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究AI代码生成工具中的vibe coding现象，发现其存在速度与质量的权衡悖论，虽降低开发门槛但影响可靠性和可维护性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对用户使用vibe coding的原因、体验、质量保证方法及对代码质量的认知的系统研究。

Method: 对101个从业者来源进行系统的灰色文献综述，提取518个第一手行为描述。

Result: 发现速度 - 质量权衡悖论，vibe编码者追求速度和易用性，但认为代码有缺陷，且常忽视质量保证。

Conclusion: vibe coding降低了开发门槛、加速了原型制作，但牺牲了可靠性和可维护性，需引导其负责任使用。

Abstract: AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially
for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and
build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding
is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition
and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code.
Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why
users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they
approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated
code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101
practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe
coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a
speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and
accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most
perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently
overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools'
outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code
generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers,
particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues
arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping,
but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry
implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding
how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use
and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.

Method: 进行系统文献综述，探索LBT领域的理论框架、现有工具和库，分析工业应用案例。

Result: 展示了LBT概念的演变和当前研究状态，凸显其在商业软件测试中的潜力和有效性。

Conclusion: LBT是软件测试中很有前途的技术，揭示其未充分利用的潜力能使从业者和研究界受益。

Abstract: Learning-Based Testing (LBT) merges learning and testing processes to achieve
both testing and behavioral adequacy. LBT utilizes active learning to infer the
model of the System Under Test (SUT), enabling scalability for large and
complex programs by requiring only a minimal set of initial test cases. The
core principle of LBT is that the SUT's behavior can be thoroughly inferred by
progressively generating test cases and subjecting the SUT to testing, thereby
ensuring comprehensive testing. Despite being in its early stages, LBT has a
solid foundation of theoretical research demonstrating its efficacy in testing
both procedural and reactive programs. This paper provides a systematic
literature review of various LBT implementations across different program types
and evaluates the current state of research in this field. We explore diverse
theoretical frameworks, existing tools, and libraries within the LBT domain to
illustrate the concept's evolution and current research status. Additionally,
we examine case studies involving the application of LBT tools in industrial
settings, highlighting their potential and effectiveness in commercial software
testing. This systematic literature review aims to offer researchers a
comprehensive perspective on the inception and development of LBT, presenting
it as a promising technique in software testing. By unveiling LBT's
underutilized potential, this paper seeks to significantly benefit the
practitioners and research community.

TL;DR: 提出CoCoA框架解释代码语言模型，结合混合标注管道，分析概念分布，与局部归因方法结合，实证评估显示其有效性，用户研究表明提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在代码上训练的大语言模型内部行为解释的关键挑战，满足信任、透明和语义鲁棒性需求。

Method: 提出Code Concept Analysis (CoCoA)框架，通过聚类上下文词嵌入挖掘模型表征空间结构；采用混合标注管道；分析概念分布；将LCA与局部归因方法结合。

Result: LCA发现的概念在语义保留扰动下稳定（平均CSI = 0.288），随微调可预测演变；用户研究中，概念增强解释消除了令牌角色歧义，在编程语言分类任务中，相比基于积分梯度的令牌级归因，以人类为中心的可解释性提高了37个百分点。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架有效提升了代码语言模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Interpreting the internal behavior of large language models trained on code
remains a critical challenge, particularly for applications demanding trust,
transparency, and semantic robustness. We propose Code Concept Analysis
(CoCoA): a global post-hoc interpretability framework that uncovers emergent
lexical, syntactic, and semantic structures in a code language model's
representation space by clustering contextualized token embeddings into
human-interpretable concept groups. We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline
that combines static analysis tool-based syntactic alignment with
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), enabling scalable labeling of
latent concepts across abstraction levels. We analyse the distribution of
concepts across layers and across three finetuning tasks. Emergent concept
clusters can help identify unexpected latent interactions and be used to
identify trends and biases within the model's learned representations. We
further integrate LCA with local attribution methods to produce
concept-grounded explanations, improving the coherence and interpretability of
token-level saliency. Empirical evaluations across multiple models and tasks
show that LCA discovers concepts that remain stable under semantic-preserving
perturbations (average Cluster Sensitivity Index, CSI = 0.288) and evolve
predictably with fine-tuning. In a user study, concept-augmented explanations
disambiguate token roles. In a user study on the programming-language
classification task, concept-augmented explanations disambiguated token roles
and improved human-centric explainability by 37 percentage points compared with
token-level attributions using Integrated Gradients.

TL;DR: 提出CodeChemist框架，利用生成测试用例实现从高资源到低资源编程语言的功能知识转移，提升低资源编程语言代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码大语言模型在不同编程语言上性能不一致，低资源编程语言因训练数据有限受影响大。

Method: 先在高资源编程语言中生成并执行代码创建封装功能知识的测试用例，再用多温度对冲采样在低资源编程语言中生成代码片段，根据测试用例通过率选择最佳代码。

Result: CodeChemist优于现有测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: CodeChemist可提升低资源编程语言代码生成性能，且无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly used in code
generation tasks across a wide range of applications. However, their
performance is often inconsistent across different programming languages (PLs),
with low-resource PLs suffering the most due to limited training data. In this
paper, we present CodeChemist, a novel and efficient framework for test-time
scaling that enables functional knowledge transfer from high-resource to
low-resource PLs using generated test cases. CodeChemist first generates and
executes code in high-resource PLs to create test cases that encapsulate
functional knowledge. It then uses multi-temperature hedged sampling to
generate code snippets in the low-resource PL and selects the best one based on
the pass rate of the test cases. Our extensive experiments show that
CodeChemist outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches, boosting the
performance of code generation for low-resource PLs without requiring any model
retraining.

TL;DR: 本文提出用于系统测试LSP服务器的灰盒混合模糊测试工具LSPFuzz，评估显示其性能优越，发现众多未知漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSP服务器可靠性受关注，但缺乏专门测试技术，需填补此空白。

Method: 采用两阶段变异管道，先对源代码进行语法感知变异，再进行编辑器操作的上下文感知调度。

Result: 在四个常用LSP服务器上评估，性能优于基线模糊测试器，报告51个漏洞，42个被确认，26个被修复，2个被分配CVE编号。

Conclusion: 推进了LSP服务器的质量保证，为该领域提供实用工具和基础见解。

Abstract: The Language Server Protocol (LSP) has revolutionized the integration of code
intelligence in modern software development. There are approximately 300 LSP
server implementations for various languages and 50 editors offering LSP
integration. However, the reliability of LSP servers is a growing concern, as
crashes can disable all code intelligence features and significantly impact
productivity, while vulnerabilities can put developers at risk even when
editing untrusted source code. Despite the widespread adoption of LSP, no
existing techniques specifically target LSP server testing. To bridge this gap,
we present LSPFuzz, a grey-box hybrid fuzzer for systematic LSP server testing.
Our key insight is that effective LSP server testing requires holistic mutation
of source code and editor operations, as bugs often manifest from their
combinations. To satisfy the sophisticated constraints of LSP and effectively
explore the input space, we employ a two-stage mutation pipeline: syntax-aware
mutations to source code, followed by context-aware dispatching of editor
operations. We evaluated LSPFuzz on four widely used LSP servers. LSPFuzz
demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline fuzzers, and uncovered
previously unknown bugs in real-world LSP servers. Of the 51 bugs we reported,
42 have been confirmed, 26 have been fixed by developers, and two have been
assigned CVE numbers. Our work advances the quality assurance of LSP servers,
providing both a practical tool and foundational insights for future research
in this domain.

Method: 引入AI驱动的自进化软件，构建基于多智能体架构的轻量级原型，该原型可自主解读用户需求、生成和验证代码、集成新功能。

Result: 多个代表性场景的案例研究表明，原型能可靠构建和复用功能，有扩展到更复杂应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 这种软件系统有望推动真正的自动化软件开发，为其发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Software automation has long been a central goal of software engineering,
striving for software development that proceeds without human intervention.
Recent efforts have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance software
automation with notable progress. However, current AI functions primarily as
assistants to human developers, leaving software development still dependent on
explicit human intervention. This raises a fundamental question: Can AI move
beyond its role as an assistant to become a core component of software, thereby
enabling genuine software automation? To investigate this vision, we introduce
AI-Driven Self-Evolving Software, a new form of software that evolves
continuously through direct interaction with users. We demonstrate the
feasibility of this idea with a lightweight prototype built on a multi-agent
architecture that autonomously interprets user requirements, generates and
validates code, and integrates new functionalities. Case studies across
multiple representative scenarios show that the prototype can reliably
construct and reuse functionality, providing early evidence that such software
systems can scale to more sophisticated applications and pave the way toward
truly automated software development. We make code and cases in this work
publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/live-software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python项目存在依赖膨胀问题，移除冗余依赖需手动操作且依赖专业知识，为解决此挑战。

Method: 引入PYTRIM系统，消除多种文件类型中的未使用导入和包声明，采用模块化设计，集成新颖的动态分析组件。

Result: 在37个合并的拉取请求的基准数据集上准确率达98.3%；在971个开源包中识别并修剪了39个的冗余依赖，6个拉取请求已被接受并合并。

Conclusion: PYTRIM可有效解决Python项目依赖膨胀问题，以开源项目形式发布利于社区贡献和进一步开发。

Abstract: Dependency bloat is a persistent challenge in Python projects, which
increases maintenance costs and security risks. While numerous tools exist for
detecting unused dependencies in Python, removing these dependencies across the
source code and configuration files of a project requires manual effort and
expertise.
  To tackle this challenge we introduce PYTRIM, an end-to-end system to
automate this process. PYTRIM eliminates unused imports and package
declarations across a variety of file types, including Python source and
configuration files such as requirements.txt and setup.py. PYTRIM's modular
design makes it agnostic to the source of dependency bloat information,
enabling integration with any detection tool. Beyond its contribution when it
comes to automation, PYTRIM also incorporates a novel dynamic analysis
component that improves dependency detection recall.
  Our evaluation of PYTRIM's end-to-end effectiveness on a ground-truth dataset
of 37 merged pull requests from prior work, shows that PYTRIM achieves 98.3%
accuracy in replicating human-made changes. To show its practical impact, we
run PYTRIM on 971 open-source packages, identifying and trimming bloated
dependencies in 39 of them. For each case, we submit a corresponding pull
request, 6 of which have already been accepted and merged. PYTRIM is available
as an open-source project, encouraging community contributions and further
development.

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中，TShape平均F1分数提高10%，消融研究和注意力可视化证实各组件的重要贡献。

Conclusion: TShape对时间序列数据中的复杂形状子形状具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is critical for maintaining the
reliability of modern IT infrastructures, where complex anomalies frequently
arise in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we present TShape, a novel
framework designed to address the challenges in industrial time series anomaly
detection. Existing methods often struggle to detect shapelet anomalies that
manifest as complex shape deviations, which appear obvious to human experts but
prove challenging for machine learning algorithms. TShape introduces a
patch-wise dual attention mechanism with multi-scale convolution to model
intricate sub-sequence variations by balancing local, fine-grained shape
features with global contextual dependencies. Our extensive evaluation on five
diverse benchmarks demonstrates that TShape outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models, achieving an average 10\% F1 score improvement in
anomaly detection. Additionally, ablation studies and attention visualizations
confirm the essential contributions of each component, highlighting the
robustness and adaptability of TShape to complex shapelet shapes in time series
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件项目依赖第三方库，Maven作为Java生态重要包管理器缺乏锁文件原生支持，影响构建可重复性和安全性。

Method: 提出Maven - Lockfile工具来生成和更新锁文件，锁文件记录所有依赖及其校验和。

Result: Maven - Lockfile能从历史提交重现构建，检测篡改工件。

Conclusion: Maven - Lockfile以最小配置为Java项目提供构建完整性和可重复性，促进Java软件供应链安全研究。

Abstract: Modern software projects depend on many third-party libraries, complicating
reproducible and secure builds. Several package managers address this with the
generation of a lockfile that freezes dependency versions and can be used to
verify the integrity of dependencies. Yet, Maven, one of the most important
package managers in the Java ecosystem, lacks native support for a lockfile. We
present Maven-Lockfile to generate and update lockfiles, with support for
rebuilding projects from past versions. Our lockfiles capture all direct and
transitive dependencies with their checksums, enabling high integrity builds.
Our evaluation shows that Maven-Lockfile can reproduce builds from historical
commits and is able to detect tampered artifacts. With minimal configuration,
Maven-Lockfile equips Java projects with modern build integrity and build
reproducibility, and fosters future research on software supply chain security
in Java.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping software work, yet we lack clear guidance on where
developers most need and want support, and how to design it responsibly. We
report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers that examines
where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help, providing the first task-aware,
empirically validated mapping from developers' perceptions of their tasks to AI
adoption patterns and responsible AI priorities. Using cognitive appraisal
theory, we show that task evaluations predict openness to and use of AI,
revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and a desire for improvement in
core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g.,
documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and
relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). Priorities for responsible AI
support vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks;
transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and
inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual
guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.

Method: 使用30个真实世界的伦理场景，让模型识别适用的伦理理论、评估行为的道德可接受性并解释原因，用模型间一致性指标与专家选择对比。

Result: 模型平均理论一致性率为73.3%，道德可接受性的二元一致率为86.7%，分歧集中在伦理模糊的案例，自由文本解释有概念上的收敛。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型表现出足够的解释稳定性和理论一致推理能力，支持在软件工程管道中作为伦理推理引擎。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software
engineering (SE) tools for tasks that extend beyond code synthesis, including
judgment under uncertainty and reasoning in ethically significant contexts. We
present a fully automated framework for assessing ethical reasoning
capabilities across 16 LLMs in a zero-shot setting, using 30 real-world
ethically charged scenarios. Each model is prompted to identify the most
applicable ethical theory to an action, assess its moral acceptability, and
explain the reasoning behind their choice. Responses are compared against
expert ethicists' choices using inter-model agreement metrics. Our results show
that LLMs achieve an average Theory Consistency Rate (TCR) of 73.3% and Binary
Agreement Rate (BAR) on moral acceptability of 86.7%, with interpretable
divergences concentrated in ethically ambiguous cases. A qualitative analysis
of free-text explanations reveals strong conceptual convergence across models
despite surface-level lexical diversity. These findings support the potential
viability of LLMs as ethical inference engines within SE pipelines, enabling
scalable, auditable, and adaptive integration of user-aligned ethical
reasoning. Our focus is the Ethical Interpreter component of a broader
profiling pipeline: we evaluate whether current LLMs exhibit sufficient
interpretive stability and theory-consistent reasoning to support automated
profiling.

Motivation: 直接代码到代码翻译方法在精确翻译上有挑战，基于伪代码的翻译方法有效性、优势和局限性未充分探索，旨在研究其对直接翻译的提升效果、有效用法及局限性。

Method: 在6种编程语言的9690个翻译任务上，使用5种流行大语言模型对比直接翻译和基于伪代码的翻译方法。

Result: 基于伪代码的翻译能有效补充直接翻译，尤其在从灵活到严格编程语言翻译或处理低资源Rust时；该方法在处理复杂程序翻译和减少原程序细节干扰有优势，也存在因伪代码问题导致的局限。

Conclusion: 建议结合直接翻译和基于伪代码翻译的优势来提高代码翻译准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in code translation.
However, accurate translation remains challenging when using the commonly
adopted direct code-to-code translation approach, which converts a program into
the target programming language (PL) in a single step. Inspired by the success
of incorporating intermediate steps to guide LLMs in resolving challenging
tasks, we explore pseudocode-based code translation, which emulates the human
semantic translation by first interpreting the program's intent and logic into
pseudocode and then implementing it in the target PL. We find that
pseudocode-based translation helps translate programs that direct translation
struggles to handle. Nonetheless, the effectiveness, advantages, and
limitations of this approach remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
present an empirical study on pseudocode-based code translation, aiming to
investigate its effectiveness in enhancing the direct translation approach,
illuminate its effective usage, and identify limitations hindering its
potential benefits. By comparing direct and pseudocode-based translation
approaches on 9,690 translation tasks across six PLs with five popular LLMs, we
demonstrate that pseudocode-based translation can effectively complement direct
translation, particularly when translating from flexible to rigid PLs or
dealing with low-resource Rust. Based on these findings, we suggest adopting
strategies that combine the complementary strengths of both approaches to
enhance code translation accuracy. We also reveal the advantages of
pseudocode-based translation in disentangling translations of complicated
programs and mitigating distractions from detailed implementations in original
programs, as well as its limitations due to incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous
pseudocode.

TL;DR: 研究探讨ChatGPT对CS1课程学生的影响，发现其能提升代码质量与效率，但概念理解提升不均，建议结构化整合与补充教学策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT访问对CS1课程学生代码质量、概念理解、任务完成时间和学生看法的影响。

Method: 进行平衡的准实验研究，让学生在两个C语言编程作业中交替使用和不使用ChatGPT，用多维评分表、概念后测调查和任务完成时间评估。

Result: 使用ChatGPT的学生代码质量评分更高、任务完成时间更短，概念理解提升在不同主题有差异，学生体验积极但有准确性和长期技能发展的担忧。

Conclusion: ChatGPT能提升新手程序员代码质量和效率，但概念理解提升不统一，建议结构化整合和补充教学策略培养独立解决问题能力。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly
used in introductory programming courses to provide real-time code generation,
debugging, and explanations. While these tools can boost productivity and code
quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on
conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code
quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student
perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced,
quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and
non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and
structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional
rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students
who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code
quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access.
However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions
topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive
experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while
expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development.
Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 很多计算机科学学生难以掌握构建全面测试套件的基础概念，不清楚哪些测试概念易被误解及误解如何反映在测试套件修订中。

Method: 在高级软件测试课程中利用自动反馈工具，分析两次作业的学生提交内容，识别普遍的概念差距和无效修改模式。

Result: 决策覆盖和异常处理是持续挑战，学生常做表面或方法级更改，未提高覆盖率。

Conclusion: 研究结果为教育者、研究人员和工具设计者提供可操作的见解，有助于改进反馈系统、针对性教学和支持学生开发健壮可维护的测试套件。

Abstract: Effective software testing is critical for producing reliable and secure
software, yet many computer science students struggle to master the
foundational concepts required to construct comprehensive test suites. While
automated feedback tools are widely used to support student learning, it
remains unclear which testing concepts are most frequently misunderstood and
how these misunderstandings are reflected in students' test suite revisions.
This study examines the specific testing concepts that lead students to make
ineffective changes, those that fail to improve code coverage, during test
suite development. Leveraging an automated feedback tool in a senior-level
software testing course, we analyzed student submissions from two assignments
to identify prevalent conceptual gaps and patterns of unproductive
modification. Our results reveal that decision coverage and exception handling
are persistent challenges, and that students most often make superficial or
method-level changes that do not enhance coverage. These findings provide
actionable insights for educators, researchers, and tool designers. By
pinpointing the concepts that most often contribute to poor testing outcomes,
we can refine feedback systems, target instruction to address persistent
misconceptions, and more effectively support students in developing robust,
maintainable test suites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的自动漏洞修复方法在现实场景难以有效泛化，存在跨仓库泛化能力有限、无法捕获长距离依赖和过度依赖表面词汇模式等问题。

Method: 提出SeCuRepair框架，采用先推理后编辑范式，运用语义感知强化学习，使用难度感知课程进行训练。

Result: 在BigVul和PrimeVul_AVR数据集上，SeCuRepair在CodeBLEU指标上分别比最佳基线高出34.52%和31.52%，消融研究证实框架各组件对性能有贡献。

Conclusion: SeCuRepair框架能有效解决现有自动漏洞修复方法的局限性，提升漏洞修复性能。

Abstract: Current learning-based Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) approaches, while
promising, often fail to generalize effectively in real-world scenarios. Our
diagnostic analysis reveals three fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art
AVR approaches: (1) limited cross-repository generalization, with performance
drops on unseen codebases; (2) inability to capture long-range dependencies,
causing a performance degradation on complex, multi-hunk repairs; and (3)
over-reliance on superficial lexical patterns, leading to significant
performance drops on vulnerabilities with minor syntactic variations like
variable renaming.
  To address these limitations, we propose SeCuRepair, a semantics-aligned,
curriculum-driven, and reasoning-enhanced framework for vulnerability repair.
At its core, SeCuRepair adopts a reason-then-edit paradigm, requiring the model
to articulate why and how a vulnerability should be fixed before generating the
patch. This explicit reasoning enforces a genuine understanding of repair logic
rather than superficial memorization of lexical patterns. SeCuRepair also moves
beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning and employs semantics-aware
reinforcement learning, rewarding patches for their syntactic and semantic
alignment with the oracle patch rather than mere token overlap. Complementing
this, a difficulty-aware curriculum progressively trains the model, starting
with simple fixes and advancing to complex, multi-hunk coordinated edits.
  We evaluate SeCuRepair on strict, repository-level splits of BigVul and newly
crafted PrimeVul_AVR datasets. SeCuRepair significantly outperforms all
baselines, surpassing the best-performing baselines by 34.52% on BigVul and
31.52% on PrimeVul\textsubscript{AVR} in terms of CodeBLEU, respectively.
Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that each component of our
framework contributes to its final performance.

Motivation: 现有代码定位方法忽略记忆方面，未利用仓库已有知识，而人类开发者会构建长期仓库记忆，因此有必要改进。

Method: 利用仓库的提交历史增强语言智能体的记忆，引入工具让智能体从非参数记忆中检索信息。

Result: 增强记忆能显著提升最先进的定位框架LocAgent在SWE - bench - verified和SWE - bench - live基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 研究有助于开发能积累和利用过去经验进行长期任务的智能体，更接近人类开发者的专业能力。

Abstract: Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software
engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language
agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the
repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is
typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In
contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as
the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and
their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such
memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized
resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that
allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent
historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of
actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We
demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a
state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the
more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards
developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for
long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.

Motivation: 软件手动测试耗时且易出错，现有基于大语言模型的自动化测试多针对单元测试，未解决E2E测试挑战。

Method: 引入GenIA - E2ETest，利用生成式AI从自然语言描述自动生成可执行的E2E测试脚本，并在两个Web应用上进行评估。

Result: 脚本元素指标平均达77%，执行精度82%，执行召回率85%，手动调整率平均10%，在典型Web场景表现稳定，但对上下文相关导航和动态内容有一定敏感性。

Conclusion: GenIA - E2ETest是加速从自然语言进行E2E测试自动化的实用有效方案，可减少手动工作，扩大自动化测试覆盖范围。

Abstract: Software testing is essential to ensure system quality, but it remains
time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually. Although recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated test
generation, most existing solutions focus on unit testing and do not address
the challenges of end-to-end (E2E) testing, which validates complete
application workflows from user input to final system response. This paper
introduces GenIA-E2ETest, which leverages generative AI to generate executable
E2E test scripts from natural language descriptions automatically. We evaluated
the approach on two web applications, assessing completeness, correctness,
adaptation effort, and robustness. Results were encouraging: the scripts
achieved an average of 77% for both element metrics, 82% for precision of
execution, 85% for execution recall, required minimal manual adjustments
(average manual modification rate of 10%), and showed consistent performance in
typical web scenarios. Although some sensitivity to context-dependent
navigation and dynamic content was observed, the findings suggest that
GenIA-E2ETest is a practical and effective solution to accelerate E2E test
automation from natural language, reducing manual effort and broadening access
to automated testing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in software development tasks
nowadays. Unlike reusing code taken from the Web, for LLMs' generated code,
developers are concerned about its lack of trustworthiness and possible
copyright or licensing violations, due to the lack of code provenance
information. This paper proposes CodeGenLink, a GitHub CoPilot extension for
Visual Studio Code aimed at (i) suggesting links containing code very similar
to automatically generated code, and (ii) whenever possible, indicating the
license of the likely origin of the code. CodeGenLink retrieves candidate links
by combining LLMs with their web search features and then performs similarity
analysis between the generated and retrieved code. Preliminary results show
that CodeGenLink effectively filters unrelated links via similarity analysis
and provides licensing information when available. Tool URL:

practitioners to assist with licensing tasks, developers still play a key role
in such a process. To this end, it is essential to understand how developers
approach license compliance tasks, the challenges they encounter, and the tools

through a study - conducted by a joint team of software engineering and legal
researchers - consisting of a survey with 58 software developers and seven
follow-up interviews. The study resulted in 15 key findings regarding the
current state of practice. We discuss the implications of our findings and
offer directions for future research as well as actionable recommendations for

Method: 分析来自开发者论坛、GitHub仓库和主流XR应用商店应用评论的2649份真实错误报告，用迭代开放编码进行定性分析，建立缺陷分类法。

Result: 同步不一致和头像相关异常是最常见症状，网络/同步逻辑缺陷和会话管理漏洞是主要根源，超34%的缺陷导致严重后果，还发现隐私和健康方面的问题。

Conclusion: 多用户XR系统在分布式系统、实时3D交互和沉浸式体验方面面临独特挑战，需要专门的测试、调试和质量保证方法。

Abstract: Multi-user Extended Reality (XR) systems enable transformative shared
experiences but introduce unique software defects that compromise user
experience. Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial
for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap,
this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR
defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including
developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app
stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we
develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three
dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity.
Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related
anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic
defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes.
Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that
fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent
disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify
concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts.
Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations
for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that
multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of
distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences,
necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality
assurance.

Conclusion: LinFACT 具有显著计算效率，能加速早期探索性实验。

Abstract: Motivated by the need to efficiently identify multiple candidates in high
trial-and-error cost tasks such as drug discovery, we propose a near-optimal
algorithm to identify all {\epsilon}-best arms (i.e., those at most {\epsilon}
worse than the optimum). Specifically, we introduce LinFACT, an algorithm
designed to optimize the identification of all {\epsilon}-best arms in linear
bandits. We establish a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the sample
complexity of this problem and demonstrate that LinFACT achieves instance
optimality by matching this lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. A key
ingredient of our proof is to integrate the lower bound directly into the
scaling process for upper bound derivation, determining the termination round
and thus the sample complexity. We also extend our analysis to settings with
model misspecification and generalized linear models. Numerical experiments,
including synthetic and real drug discovery data, demonstrate that LinFACT
identifies more promising candidates with reduced sample complexity, offering
significant computational efficiency and accelerating early-stage exploratory
experiments.

### [276] [Private Learning of Littlestone Classes, Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00076)
*Xin Lyu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider online and PAC learning of Littlestone classes subject to the
constraint of approximate differential privacy. Our main result is a private
learner to online-learn a Littlestone class with a mistake bound of
$\tilde{O}(d^{9.5}\cdot \log(T))$ in the realizable case, where $d$ denotes the
Littlestone dimension and $T$ the time horizon. This is a doubly-exponential
improvement over the state-of-the-art [GL'21] and comes polynomially close to
the lower bound for this task.
  The advancement is made possible by a couple of ingredients. The first is a
clean and refined interpretation of the ``irreducibility'' technique from the
state-of-the-art private PAC-learner for Littlestone classes [GGKM'21]. Our new
perspective also allows us to improve the PAC-learner of [GGKM'21] and give a
sample complexity upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{d^5
\log(1/\delta\beta)}{\varepsilon \alpha})$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote
the accuracy and confidence of the PAC learner, respectively. This improves
over [GGKM'21] by factors of $\frac{d}{\alpha}$ and attains an optimal
dependence on $\alpha$.
  Our algorithm uses a private sparse selection algorithm to \emph{sample} from
a pool of strongly input-dependent candidates. However, unlike most previous
uses of sparse selection algorithms, where one only cares about the utility of
output, our algorithm requires understanding and manipulating the actual
distribution from which an output is drawn. In the proof, we use a sparse
version of the Exponential Mechanism from [GKM'21] which behaves nicely under
our framework and is amenable to a very easy utility proof.

Conclusion: 所提出的神经密度估计器有效，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Neural network-based methods for (un)conditional density estimation have
recently gained substantial attention, as various neural density estimators
have outperformed classical approaches in real-data experiments. Despite these
empirical successes, implementation can be challenging due to the need to
ensure non-negativity and unit-mass constraints, and theoretical understanding
remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether such estimators can
adaptively achieve faster convergence rates when the underlying density
exhibits a low-dimensional structure. This paper addresses these gaps by
proposing a structure-agnostic neural density estimator that is (i)
straightforward to implement and (ii) provably adaptive, attaining faster rates
when the true density admits a low-dimensional composition structure. Another
key contribution of our work is to show that the proposed estimator integrates
naturally into generative sampling pipelines, most notably score-based
diffusion models, where it achieves provably faster convergence when the
underlying density is structured. We validate its performance through extensive
simulations and a real-data application.

Result: 对抗扰动会显著增加FDR，同时保持高检测能力。

Conclusion: 当前误差控制的新奇性检测方法存在根本局限，需开发更鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of conformal novelty detection.
In particular, we focus on AdaDetect, a powerful learning-based framework for
novelty detection with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. While
AdaDetect provides rigorous statistical guarantees under benign conditions, its
behavior under adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. We first formulate
an oracle attack setting that quantifies the worst-case degradation of FDR,
deriving an upper bound that characterizes the statistical cost of attacks.
This idealized formulation directly motivates a practical and effective attack
scheme that only requires query access to AdaDetect's output labels. Coupling
these formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial
algorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of AdaDetect on
synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial
perturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high
detection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled
novelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust
alternatives.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design provides a principled framework for
selecting experimental settings that maximize obtained information. In this
work, we focus on estimating the expected information gain in the setting where
the differential entropy of the likelihood is either independent of the design
or can be evaluated explicitly. This reduces the problem to maximum entropy
estimation, alleviating several challenges inherent in expected information
gain computation.
  Our study is motivated by large-scale inference problems, such as inverse
problems, where the computational cost is dominated by expensive likelihood
evaluations. We propose a computational approach in which the evidence density
is approximated by a Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo surrogate, while the
differential entropy is evaluated using standard methods without additional
likelihood evaluations. We prove that this strategy achieves convergence rates
that are comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art methods for full
expected information gain estimation, particularly when the cost of entropy
evaluation is negligible. Moreover, our approach relies only on mild smoothness
of the forward map and avoids stronger technical assumptions required in
earlier work. We also present numerical experiments, which confirm our
theoretical findings.

Abstract: When training large-scale models, the performance typically scales with the
number of parameters and the dataset size according to a slow power law. A
fundamental theoretical and practical question is whether comparable
performance can be achieved with significantly smaller models and substantially
less data. In this work, we provide a positive and constructive answer. We
prove that a generic permutation-invariant function of $d$ objects can be
asymptotically compressed into a function of $\operatorname{polylog} d$ objects
with vanishing error. This theorem yields two key implications: (Ia) a large
neural network can be compressed to polylogarithmic width while preserving its
learning dynamics; (Ib) a large dataset can be compressed to polylogarithmic
size while leaving the loss landscape of the corresponding model unchanged.
(Ia) directly establishes a proof of the \textit{dynamical} lottery ticket
hypothesis, which states that any ordinary network can be strongly compressed
such that the learning dynamics and result remain unchanged. (Ib) shows that a
neural scaling law of the form $L\sim d^{-\alpha}$ can be boosted to an
arbitrarily fast power law decay, and ultimately to $\exp(-\alpha'
\sqrt[m]{d})$.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for interpretability in machine learning,
functional ANOVA decomposition has gained renewed attention as a principled
tool for breaking down high-dimensional function into low-dimensional
components that reveal the contributions of different variable groups.
Recently, Tensor Product Neural Network (TPNN) has been developed and applied
as basis functions in the functional ANOVA model, referred to as ANOVA-TPNN. A
disadvantage of ANOVA-TPNN, however, is that the components to be estimated
must be specified in advance, which makes it difficult to incorporate
higher-order TPNNs into the functional ANOVA model due to computational and
memory constraints. In this work, we propose Bayesian-TPNN, a Bayesian
inference procedure for the functional ANOVA model with TPNN basis functions,
enabling the detection of higher-order components with reduced computational
cost compared to ANOVA-TPNN. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm and
demonstrate that Bayesian-TPNN performs well by analyzing multiple benchmark
datasets. Theoretically, we prove that the posterior of Bayesian-TPNN is
consistent.

Conclusion: 基于Segre流形的优化算法能有效解决低CP秩张量恢复问题，具有理论收敛性和实际有效性。

Abstract: Recovering a low-CP-rank tensor from noisy linear measurements is a central
challenge in high-dimensional data analysis, with applications spanning tensor
PCA, tensor regression, and beyond. We exploit the intrinsic geometry of
rank-one tensors by casting the recovery task as an optimization problem over
the Segre manifold, the smooth Riemannian manifold of rank-one tensors. This
geometric viewpoint yields two powerful algorithms: Riemannian Gradient Descent
(RGD) and Riemannian Gauss-Newton (RGN), each of which preserves feasibility at
every iteration. Under mild noise assumptions, we prove that RGD converges at a
local linear rate, while RGN exhibits an initial local quadratic convergence
phase that transitions to a linear rate as the iterates approach the
statistical noise floor. Extensive synthetic experiments validate these
convergence guarantees and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our
methods.

Abstract: Wind farm placement arranges the size and the location of multiple wind farms
within a given region. The power output is highly related to the wind speed on
spatial and temporal levels, which can be modeled by advanced data-driven
approaches. To this end, we use a probabilistic neural network as a surrogate
that accounts for the spatiotemporal correlations of wind speed. This neural
network uses ReLU activation functions so that it can be reformulated as
mixed-integer linear set of constraints (constraint learning). We embed these
constraints into the placement decision problem, formulated as a two-stage
stochastic optimization problem. Specifically, conditional quantiles of the
total electricity production are regarded as recursive decisions in the second
stage. We use real high-resolution regional data from a northern region in
Spain. We validate that the constraint learning approach outperforms the
classical bilinear interpolation method. Numerical experiments are implemented
on risk-averse investors. The results indicate that risk-averse investors
concentrate on dominant sites with strong wind, while exhibiting spatial
diversification and sensitive capacity spread in non-dominant sites.
Furthermore, we show that if we introduce transmission line costs in the
problem, risk-averse investors favor locations closer to the substations. On
the contrary, risk-neutral investors are willing to move to further locations
to achieve higher expected profits. Our results conclude that the proposed
novel approach is able to tackle a portfolio of regional wind farm placements
and further provide guidance for risk-averse investors.

Conclusion: 提供了依赖于变压器宽度和深度的可解玩具模型，可计算风险的精确渐近性并推导幂律。

Abstract: We study in-context learning (ICL) of linear regression in a deep linear
self-attention model, characterizing how performance depends on various
computational and statistical resources (width, depth, number of training
steps, batch size and data per context). In a joint limit where data dimension,
context length, and residual stream width scale proportionally, we analyze the
limiting asymptotics for three ICL settings: (1) isotropic covariates and tasks
(ISO), (2) fixed and structured covariance (FS), and (3) where covariances are
randomly rotated and structured (RRS). For ISO and FS settings, we find that
depth only aids ICL performance if context length is limited. Alternatively, in
the RRS setting where covariances change across contexts, increasing the depth
leads to significant improvements in ICL, even at infinite context length. This
provides a new solvable toy model of neural scaling laws which depends on both
width and depth of a transformer and predicts an optimal transformer shape as a
function of compute. This toy model enables computation of exact asymptotics
for the risk as well as derivation of powerlaws under source/capacity
conditions for the ICL tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法稳定、灵活，适用于迭代分析流程和多年任务数据集。

Abstract: Flexible and efficient noise characterization is crucial for the precise
estimation of gravitational wave parameters. We introduce a fast and accurate
Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long,
stationary time series tailored specifically for LISA data analysis. Our
approach models the PSD as a geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric
component, combining the computational efficiency of parametric models with the
flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The
nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines.
Adaptive, data-driven knot placement performed once during initialization
eliminates computationally expensive reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo,
while hierarchical roughness penalty priors prevent overfitting. This design
yields stable, flexible PSD estimates with runtimes of minutes instead of
hours. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator
consistency. It shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the
integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring
fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to a year of
simulated LISA $X$-channel noise, our method achieves relative integrated
absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ with computation times less than
three minutes, which makes it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and
multi-year mission datasets.

Conclusion: 先对F - D曲线应用BI，再对DIC场应用，能改善GTN参数估计，还以AA6111铝合金为例讨论了原因。

Abstract: Reliable parameter identification in ductile damage models remains
challenging because the salient physics of damage progression are localized to
small regions in material responses, and their signatures are often diluted in
specimen-level measurements. Here, we propose a sequential Bayesian Inference
(BI) framework for the calibration of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN)
model using multimodal experimental data (i.e., the specimen-level
force-displacement (F-D) measurements and the spatially resolved digital image
correlation (DIC) strain fields). This calibration approach builds on a
previously developed two-step BI framework that first establishes a
low-computational-cost emulator for a physics-based simulator (here, a finite
element model incorporating the GTN material model) and then uses the
experimental data to sample posteriors for the material model parameters using
the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (T-MCMC). A central challenge to the
successful application of this BI framework to the present problem arises from
the high-dimensional representations needed to capture the salient features
embedded in the F-D curves and the DIC fields. In this paper, it is
demonstrated that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides low-dimensional
representations that make it possible to apply the BI framework to the problem.
Most importantly, it is shown that the sequence in which the BI is applied has
a dramatic influence on the results obtained. Specifically, it is observed that
applying BI first on F-D curves and subsequently on the DIC fields produces
improved estimates of the GTN parameters. Possible causes for these
observations are discussed in this paper, using AA6111 aluminum alloy as a case
study.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches have revolutionized the design and optimization of
photonic metadevices by harnessing advanced artificial intelligence
methodologies. This review takes a model-centric perspective that synthesizes
emerging design strategies and delineates how traditional trial-and-error and
computationally intensive electromagnetic simulations are being supplanted by
deep learning frameworks that efficiently navigate expansive design spaces. We
discuss artificial intelligence implementation in several metamaterial design
aspects from high-degree-of-freedom design to large language model-assisted
design. By addressing challenges such as transformer model implementation,
fabrication limitations, and intricate mutual coupling effects, these
AI-enabled strategies not only streamline the forward modeling process but also
offer robust pathways for the realization of multifunctional and
fabrication-friendly nanophotonic devices. This review further highlights
emerging opportunities and persistent challenges, setting the stage for
next-generation strategies in nanophotonic engineering.

Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for turbulence modeling, applied to flow
prediction in the FDA nozzle. In this study, the standard RANS equations have
been modified using an implicit-explicit hybrid approach. New variables were
introduced, and a solver was developed within the OpenFOAM framework,
integrating a machine learning module to estimate these variables. The
invariant input features were derived based on Hilbert's basis theorem, and the
outputs of the machine learning model were obtained through eigenvalue-vector
decomposition of the Reynolds stress tensor. Validation was performed using DNS
data for turbulent flow in a square channel at various Reynolds numbers. A
baseline MLP was first trained at $Re=2900$ and tested at $Re=3500$ to assess
its ability to reproduce turbulence anisotropy and secondary flows. To further
enhance generalization, three benchmark DNS datasets were transformed into
images via the Deep-Insight method, enabling the use of convolutional neural
networks. The trained Deep-Insight network demonstrated improved prediction of
turbulence structures in the FDA blood nozzle, highlighting the promise of
data-driven augmentation in turbulence modeling.

Conclusion: 拉格朗日粒子追踪的适用范围可扩展到多相和高速流。

Abstract: We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown
particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers
time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but
experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further
complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both
Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To
address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian
flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous
inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing
equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish
empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative
regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow
states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous
isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate
simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the
feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible,
shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity,
pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density),
highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in
supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding
density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy,
yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these
results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and
high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.

Conclusion: 所提算法在实际中是有效的。

Abstract: An algorithm is proposed, analyzed, and tested for solving continuous
nonlinear-equality-constrained optimization problems where the constraints are
defined by an expectation or an average over a large (finite) number of terms.
The main idea of the algorithm is to solve a sequence of equality-constrained
problems, each involving a finite sample of constraint-function terms, over
which the sample set grows progressively. Under assumptions about the
constraint functions and their first- and second-order derivatives that are
reasonable in some real-world settings of interest, it is shown that -- with a
sufficiently large initial sample -- solving a sequence of problems defined
through progressive sampling yields a better worst-case sample complexity bound
compared to solving a single problem with a full set of samples. The results of
numerical experiments with a set of test problems demonstrate that the proposed
approach can be effective in practice.

Conclusion: 非欧几里得BPM可作为理解一类几何感知优化算法的概念蓝图，揭示其实效性原理。

Abstract: The recently proposed Broximal Point Method (BPM) [Gruntkowska et al., 2025]
offers an idealized optimization framework based on iteratively minimizing the
objective function over norm balls centered at the current iterate. It enjoys
striking global convergence guarantees, converging linearly and in a finite
number of steps for proper, closed and convex functions. However, its
theoretical analysis has so far been confined to the Euclidean geometry. At the
same time, emerging trends in deep learning optimization, exemplified by
algorithms such as Muon [Jordan et al., 2024] and Scion [Pethick et al., 2025],
demonstrate the practical advantages of minimizing over balls defined via
non-Euclidean norms which better align with the underlying geometry of the
associated loss landscapes. In this note, we ask whether the convergence theory
of BPM can be extended to this more general, non-Euclidean setting. We give a
positive answer, showing that most of the elegant guarantees of the original
method carry over to arbitrary norm geometries. Along the way, we clarify which
properties are preserved and which necessarily break down when leaving the
Euclidean realm. Our analysis positions Non-Euclidean BPM as a conceptual
blueprint for understanding a broad class of geometry-aware optimization
algorithms, shedding light on the principles behind their practical
effectiveness.

Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in
which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under
the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem
satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the
maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness
property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for
solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate
under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact
proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact
gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a
locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees
for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the
original minimax problem.

Result: 得到与经典蒙特卡罗方差相当的方差，且弱导数估计方差恒定，而常用得分函数方法方差随样本路径长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 这些结果为罕见事件下的反事实条件随机梯度算法构建了高效框架。

Abstract: We study counterfactual stochastic optimization of conditional loss
functionals under misspecified and noisy gradient information. The difficulty
is that when the conditioning event has vanishing or zero probability, naive
Monte Carlo estimators are prohibitively inefficient; kernel smoothing, though
common, suffers from slow convergence. We propose a two-stage kernel-free
methodology. First, we show using Malliavin calculus that the conditional loss
functional of a diffusion process admits an exact representation as a Skorohod
integral, yielding variance comparable to classical Monte-Carlo variance.
Second, we establish that a weak derivative estimate of the conditional loss
functional with respect to model parameters can be evaluated with constant
variance, in contrast to the widely used score function method whose variance
grows linearly in the sample path length. Together, these results yield an
efficient framework for counterfactual conditional stochastic gradient
algorithms in rare-event regimes.

Conclusion: 所提方法可解决现有方法无法处理的含隐式哈密顿量的最优控制问题。

Abstract: Neural network approaches that parameterize value functions have succeeded in
approximating high-dimensional optimal feedback controllers when the
Hamiltonian admits explicit formulas. However, many practical problems, such as
the space shuttle reentry problem and bicycle dynamics, among others, may
involve implicit Hamiltonians that do not admit explicit formulas, limiting the
applicability of existing methods. Rather than directly parameterizing
controls, which does not leverage the Hamiltonian's underlying structure, we
propose an end-to-end implicit deep learning approach that directly
parameterizes the value function to learn optimal control laws. Our method
enforces physical principles by ensuring trained networks adhere to the control
laws by exploiting the fundamental relationship between the optimal control and
the value function's gradient; this is a direct consequence of the connection
between Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and dynamic programming. Using
Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), we achieve efficient training despite
temporal coupling in trajectory optimization. We show that JFB produces descent
directions for the optimal control objective and experimentally demonstrate
that our approach effectively learns high-dimensional feedback controllers
across multiple scenarios involving implicit Hamiltonians, which existing
methods cannot address.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However,
the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG
signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural
states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective
cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover
complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,
we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a
unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable
conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the
first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model
demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,
open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering
valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of
general-purpose EEG models.

Abstract: This study reinterprets a Monte Carlo simulation of students' perceived
success with generative AI (GenAI) through a Kantian-axiomatic lens. Building
on prior work, theme-level survey statistics Ease of Use and Learnability,
System Efficiency and Learning Burden, and Perceived Complexity and Integration
from a representative dataset are used to generate 10,000 synthetic scores per
theme on the [1,5] Likert scale. The simulated outputs are evaluated against
the axioms of dense linear order without endpoints (DLO): irreflexivity,
transitivity, total comparability (connectedness), no endpoints (no greatest
and no least; A4-A5), and density (A6). At the data level, the basic ordering
axioms (A1-A3) are satisfied, whereas no-endpoints (A4-A5) and density (A6)
fail as expected. Likert clipping introduces minimum and maximum observed
values, and a finite, discretized sample need not contain a value strictly
between any two distinct scores. These patterns are read not as methodological
defects but as markers of an epistemological boundary. Following Kant and
Friedman, the findings suggest that what simulations capture finite, quantized
observations cannot instantiate the ideal properties of an unbounded, dense
continuum. Such properties belong to constructive intuition rather than to
finite sampling alone. A complementary visualization contrasts the empirical
histogram with a sine-curve proxy to clarify this divide. The contribution is
interpretive rather than data-expansive: it reframes an existing simulation as
a probe of the synthetic a priori structure underlying students' perceptions,
showing how formal order-theoretic coherence coexists with principled failures
of endpoint-freeness and density in finite empirical models.

Result: 发现人工智能在个体和政治层面都造成了新的不自由形式——数字统治。

Conclusion: 个体必须有机制让算法（及其开发者）负责才能真正自由。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize social and political life in
unpredictable ways, raising questions about the principles that ought to guide
its development and regulation. By examining digital advertising and social
media algorithms, this article highlights how artificial intelligence already
poses a significant threat to the republican conception of liberty -- or
freedom from unaccountable power -- and thereby highlights the necessity of
protecting republican liberty when integrating artificial intelligence into
society. At an individual level, these algorithms can subconsciously influence
behavior and thought, and those subject to this influence have limited power
over the algorithms they engage. At the political level, these algorithms give
technology company executives and other foreign parties the power to influence
domestic political processes, such as elections; the multinational nature of
algorithm-based platforms and the speed with which technology companies
innovate make incumbent state institutions ineffective at holding these actors
accountable. At both levels, artificial intelligence has thus created a new
form of unfreedom: digital domination. By drawing on the works of Quentin
Skinner, Philip Pettit, and other republican theorists, this article asserts
that individuals must have mechanisms to hold algorithms (and those who develop
them) accountable in order to be truly free.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective
clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive
Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this
study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer
Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and
white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural
networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an
end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked
ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to
optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art
accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and
91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming
conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve
interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI
techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and
attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter
slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These
results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical
decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and
effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis.
Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from
retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without
any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant
risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in
uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to
reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making
in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction
coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a
more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the
uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance
metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted
cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution,
establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection
improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.

just model performance. This approach introduces a critical advancement by
integrating medical ontologies with semantic technology to improve diagnostic
accuracy. The study enhances AI diagnostic reliability by integrating machine
learning outputs with structured medical knowledge frameworks to boost

scalable efficient pneumonia detection solution. This study advances AI
integration into clinical settings by developing more precise automated
diagnostic methods that deliver consistent medical imaging results.

(ST-GCN) to extract skeletal features and integrates transformer-based temporal
attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we
constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living
(ADL) and 5 range-of-motion (ROM) collected from stroke and non-disabled
participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists.
Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline
in terms of MAD, RMSE, and MAPE. Furthermore, the system provides user feedback
that combines patient-centered assessment and monitoring. The results
demonstrate that the proposed system offers a scalable approach for
quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment.

Motivation: 现有WSI生存分析方法可解释性有限，且常忽略异质切片图像的预测不确定性。

Method: 提出DPsurv，即双原型全切片图像证据融合网络，输出含不确定性的生存区间，并通过多种方式实现预测解释。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上实验取得最高平均一致性指数和最低平均综合Brier分数。

Conclusion: DPsurv有效可靠，其预测结果解释在特征、推理和决策层面提供透明度，增强了可信度和可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival
analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both
cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and
prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in
WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook
predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose
DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that
outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of
predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and
component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly
available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest
mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of
DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the
feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness
and interpretability of DPsurv.

TL;DR: 提出U - DFA架构用于医学图像分割，在数据集上表现出色且参数少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型、CNN与transformer结合方法、VLM和基础模型在医学图像分割中有局部感受野、特征融合不佳、领域差距和计算成本高等问题。

Method: 提出U - DFA统一架构，集成LGFA模块，将SPA模块的空间特征注入冻结的DINOv2块。

Result: 在Synapse和ACDC数据集上达到SOTA性能，仅用33%可训练模型参数。

Conclusion: U - DFA是多模态医学图像分割的强大且可扩展框架。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in overall diagnosis
and is one of the most essential tasks in the diagnostic pipeline. CNN-based
models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and
fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with
transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the
local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation
models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however,
they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this
end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that
integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation
performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial
Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages,
enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets
with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate
that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation
across multiple modalities.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种深度学习框架，利用纵向信息实现低剂量MRI图像的虚拟对比增强，可减少钆基造影剂使用，且经实验验证效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基造影剂存在钆滞留和积累问题，需要减少其剂量，因此有必要开发降低剂量的策略。

Method: 提出深度学习框架，通过纳入同一患者的先前全剂量MRI检查利用纵向信息，实现从低剂量采集生成全剂量对比后T1加权MRI图像的虚拟对比增强。

Result: 纵向方法在多个重建指标上显著提高图像质量，不同模拟对比剂量实验证实了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将先前成像历史整合到基于深度学习的虚拟对比增强流程中，可减少GBCA使用且不影响诊断效用，为临床MRI实践的纵向监测提供更安全、可持续的方法。

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance lesion detection and characterisation,
particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Nevertheless, concerns regarding
gadolinium retention and accumulation in brain and body tissues, most notably
for diseases that require close monitoring and frequent GBCA injection, have
led to the need for strategies to reduce dosage. In this study, a deep learning
framework is proposed for the virtual contrast enhancement of full-dose
post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images from corresponding low-dose acquisitions.
The contribution of the presented model is its utilisation of longitudinal
information, which is achieved by incorporating a prior full-dose MRI
examination from the same patient. A comparative evaluation against a
non-longitudinal single session model demonstrated that the longitudinal
approach significantly improves image quality across multiple reconstruction
metrics. Furthermore, experiments with varying simulated contrast doses
confirmed the robustness of the proposed method. These results emphasize the
potential of integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual
contrast enhancement pipelines to reduce GBCA usage without compromising
diagnostic utility, thus paving the way for safer, more sustainable
longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出MARS框架用于高保真音频生成，实验表明其性能良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频生成研究从波形方法转向频谱图方法，图像合成中跨尺度自回归有优势，结合这些来改进音频生成。

Method: 提出MARS框架，将频谱图视为多通道图像，采用通道复用技术，用共享分词器提供跨尺度离散表示，用基于变换器的自回归器从粗到细优化频谱图。

Result: 在大规模数据集上的实验显示，MARS在多个评估指标上与最先进的基线表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: MARS为高保真音频生成建立了高效可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Research on audio generation has progressively shifted from waveform-based
approaches to spectrogram-based methods, which more naturally capture harmonic
and temporal structures. At the same time, advances in image synthesis have
shown that autoregression across scales, rather than tokens, improves coherence
and detail. Building on these ideas, we introduce MARS (Multi-channel
AutoRegression on Spectrograms), a framework that treats spectrograms as
multi-channel images and employs channel multiplexing (CMX), a reshaping
technique that lowers height and width without discarding information. A shared
tokenizer provides consistent discrete representations across scales, enabling
a transformer-based autoregressor to refine spectrograms from coarse to fine
resolutions efficiently. Experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that
MARS performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art baselines across
multiple evaluation metrics, establishing an efficient and scalable paradigm
for high-fidelity audio generation.

TL;DR: 提出TAI - Speech框架进行痴呆检测，通过两项创新动态建模自发语音，在数据集上表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习处理长序列有计算复杂性瓶颈，现有痴呆检测方法缺乏灵活性，忽略动态时间模式。

Method: 引入TAI - Speech框架，包括光流启发的迭代细化和基于交叉注意力的韵律对齐两个创新组件。

Result: 在DementiaBank数据集上，TAI - Speech的AUC为0.839，准确率80.6%，优于文本基线且无需依赖ASR。

Conclusion: 工作为自动认知评估提供了更灵活、强大的解决方案，可直接处理原始音频动态。

Abstract: Deep learning systems often struggle with processing long sequences, where
computational complexity can become a bottleneck. Current methods for automated
dementia detection using speech frequently rely on static, time-agnostic
features or aggregated linguistic content, lacking the flexibility to model the
subtle, progressive deterioration inherent in speech production. These
approaches often miss the dynamic temporal patterns that are critical early
indicators of cognitive decline. In this paper, we introduce TAI-Speech, a
Temporal Aware Iterative framework that dynamically models spontaneous speech
for dementia detection. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through
two key innovations: 1) Optical Flow-inspired Iterative Refinement: By treating
spectrograms as sequential frames, this component uses a convolutional GRU to
capture the fine-grained, frame-to-frame evolution of acoustic features. 2)
Cross-Attention Based Prosodic Alignment: This component dynamically aligns
spectral features with prosodic patterns, such as pitch and pauses, to create a
richer representation of speech production deficits linked to functional
decline (IADL). TAI-Speech adaptively models the temporal evolution of each
utterance, enhancing the detection of cognitive markers. Experimental results
on the DementiaBank dataset show that TAI-Speech achieves a strong AUC of 0.839
and 80.6\% accuracy, outperforming text-based baselines without relying on ASR.
Our work provides a more flexible and robust solution for automated cognitive
assessment, operating directly on the dynamics of raw audio.

Method: 提出适应音乐结构化符号表示的Attribute - Specialized Key - Value Head Sharing (AS - KVHS)方法。

Result: 实现约30%的推理加速，客观评估质量下降约0.4%，主观测试有轻微改善，发布SAGE - Music基准。

Conclusion: 首次系统研究BPE在多轨符号音乐中的泛化性，引入AS - KVHS用于低延迟符号音乐生成。

Abstract: Low-latency symbolic music generation is essential for real-time
improvisation and human-AI co-creation. Existing transformer-based models,
however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality.
Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly
degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods -
though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in
multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose
Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's
structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with
only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight
improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the
first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music,
and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation.
Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches
or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.

Motivation: 传统睡眠呼吸暂停筛查方法（多导睡眠监测）昂贵且耗时，不适用于大规模人群筛查，需更易获取的筛查方法。

Method: 使用18个音频文件，将呼吸声音转换为频谱图，对呼吸暂停片段过采样平衡数据集，应用类别权重减少对多数类的偏差。

Result: 模型在呼吸暂停检测上的召回率达到90.55，精度较低。

Conclusion: 该方法虽精度低，但高召回率表明其可作为低成本筛查工具，用于家庭或基础临床场景，有助于更早识别高危人群。

Abstract: Sleep apnea is a serious sleep-related breathing disorder that is common and
can impact health if left untreated. Currently the traditional method for
screening and diagnosis is overnight polysomnography. Polysomnography is
expensive and takes a lot of time, and is not practical for screening large
groups of people. In this paper, we explored a more accessible option, using
respiratory audio recordings to spot signs of apnea.We utilized 18 audio
files.The approach involved converting breathing sounds into spectrograms,
balancing the dataset by oversampling apnea segments, and applying class
weights to reduce bias toward the majority class. The model reached a recall of
90.55 for apnea detection. Intentionally, prioritizing catching apnea events
over general accuracy. Despite low precision,the high recall suggests potential
as a low-cost screening tool that could be used at home or in basic clinical
setups, potentially helping identify at-risk individuals much earlier.

Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of multimodal (text and audio) benchmarks have
emerged, primarily focusing on evaluating models' understanding capability.
However, exploration into assessing generative capabilities remains limited,
especially for open-ended long-form content generation. Significant challenges
lie in no reference standard answer, no unified evaluation metrics and
uncontrollable human judgments. In this work, we take podcast-like audio
generation as a starting point and propose PodEval, a comprehensive and
well-designed open-source evaluation framework. In this framework: 1) We
construct a real-world podcast dataset spanning diverse topics, serving as a
reference for human-level creative quality. 2) We introduce a multimodal
evaluation strategy and decompose the complex task into three dimensions: text,
speech and audio, with different evaluation emphasis on "Content" and "Format".
3) For each modality, we design corresponding evaluation methods, involving
both objective metrics and subjective listening test. We leverage
representative podcast generation systems (including open-source, close-source,
and human-made) in our experiments. The results offer in-depth analysis and
insights into podcast generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of PodEval in
evaluating open-ended long-form audio. This project is open-source to

Abstract: The Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC) Challenge aims to advance neural audio
coding for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The first edition
focuses on low-resource neural speech codecs that must operate reliably under
everyday noise and reverberation, while satisfying strict constraints on
computational complexity, latency, and bitrate. Track 1 targets transparency
codecs, which aim to preserve the perceptual transparency of input speech under
mild noise and reverberation. Track 2 addresses enhancement codecs, which
combine coding and compression with denoising and dereverberation. This paper
presents the official baseline systems for both tracks in the 2025 LRAC
Challenge. The baselines are convolutional neural codec models with Residual
Vector Quantization, trained end-to-end using a combination of adversarial and
reconstruction objectives. We detail the data filtering and augmentation
strategies, model architectures, optimization procedures, and checkpoint
selection criteria.

Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding
the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has
traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score
(MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent
rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we
introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS
datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation
across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct
and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models,
semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments
reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall
performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform
considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models
struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on
these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an
MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale
rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results
show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality
discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging
cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological
framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech
quality assessment.

Abstract: In ordinary importance sampling with a nonnegative integrand there exists an
importance sampling strategy with zero variance. Practical sampling strategies
are often based on approximating that optimal solution, potentially approaching
zero variance. There is a positivisation extension of that method to handle
integrands that take both positive and negative values. Self-normalized
importance sampling uses a ratio estimate, for which the optimal sampler does
not have zero variance and so zero variance cannot even be approached in
practice. Strategies that separately estimate the numerator and denominator of
that ratio can approach zero variance. This paper develops another zero
variance solution for self-normalized importance sampling. The first step is to
write the desired expectation as the zero of an estimating equation using
Fieller's technique. Then we apply the positivisation strategy to the
estimating equation. This paper give conditions for existence and uniqueness of
the sample solution to the estimating equation. Then it give conditions for
consistency and asymptotic normality and an expression for the asymptotic
variance. The sample size multiplied by the variance of the asymptotic formula
becomes arbitrarily close to zero for certain sampling strategies.

TL;DR: 本文推导线性回归中PaP和LOCO变量重要性度量的闭式表达式，解释其受共线性影响差异，蒙特卡罗模拟验证，结果对随机森林等模型有近似效果，为重要性度量建立理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习问题中理解变量重要性很关键，线性回归中PaP和LOCO方法虽有实证研究，但缺乏正式理论。

Method: 推导线性回归中PaP和LOCO两种度量的闭式表达式，进行蒙特卡罗模拟验证。

Result: PaP与系数和预测变量变异性成正比，LOCO与系数成正比但受共线性抑制；蒙特卡罗模拟证实结果；对随机森林等模型有合理近似。

Conclusion: 为两种广泛使用的重要性度量建立理论基础，连接实证与理论，增强变量重要性度量的可解释性和应用性。

Abstract: In many machine learning problems, understanding variable importance is a
central concern. Two common approaches are Permute-and-Predict (PaP), which
randomly permutes a feature in a validation set, and Leave-One-Covariate-Out
(LOCO), which retrains models after permuting a training feature. Both methods
deem a variable important if predictions with the original data substantially
outperform those with permutations. In linear regression, empirical studies
have linked PaP to regression coefficients and LOCO to $t$-statistics, but a
formal theory has been lacking. We derive closed-form expressions for both
measures, expressed using square-root transformations. PaP is shown to be
proportional to the coefficient and predictor variability: $\text{PaP}_i =
\beta_i \sqrt{2\operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{x}^v_i)}$, while LOCO is proportional
to the coefficient but dampened by collinearity (captured by $\Delta$):
$\text{LOCO}_i = \beta_i (1 -\Delta)\sqrt{1 + c}$. These derivations explain
why PaP is largely unaffected by multicollinearity, whereas LOCO is highly
sensitive to it. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these findings across varying
levels of collinearity. Although derived for linear regression, we also show
that these results provide reasonable approximations for models like Random
Forests. Overall, this work establishes a theoretical basis for two widely used
importance measures, helping analysts understand how they are affected by the
true coefficients, dimension, and covariance structure. This work bridges
empirical evidence and theory, enhancing the interpretability and application
of variable importance measures.

Result: ALIGNED在平衡一致性上表现最佳，优于现有方法，还重新发现了有生物学意义的知识。

Conclusion: 该工作超越现有方法，实现了生物学机制理解的透明性和进化。

Abstract: The transcriptional response to genetic perturbation reveals fundamental
insights into complex cellular systems. While current approaches have made
progress in predicting genetic perturbation responses, they provide limited
biological understanding and cannot systematically refine existing knowledge.
Overcoming these limitations requires an end-to-end integration of data-driven
learning and existing knowledge. However, this integration is challenging due
to inconsistencies between data and knowledge bases, such as noise,
misannotation, and incompleteness. To address this challenge, we propose
ALIGNED (Adaptive aLignment for Inconsistent Genetic kNowledgE and Data), a
neuro-symbolic framework based on the Abductive Learning (ABL) paradigm. This
end-to-end framework aligns neural and symbolic components and performs
systematic knowledge refinement. We introduce a balanced consistency metric to
evaluate the predictions' consistency against both data and knowledge. Our
results show that ALIGNED outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the
highest balanced consistency, while also re-discovering biologically meaningful
knowledge. Our work advances beyond existing methods to enable both the
transparency and the evolution of mechanistic biological understanding.

Motivation: 当前数据驱动天体物理在检测和表征物体属性相关性时，未利用数据中理论预测的关键信息，如直接相关性、决定方向和混杂因素等。

Result: 在约5×10⁵个低红移星系数据上进行演示，证明算法能区分仅基于相关性无法区分的物理机制。

Conclusion: 因果发现方法可用于天体物理数据集，恢复关键信息并区分物理机制。

Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and
characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then
used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process
fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the
theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as
opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these
determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate
variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to
recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology
for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely
unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for
astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift
galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish
physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准缺乏专注于阿拉伯语大语言模型多步推理的实质性数据集，尤其是在开放式上下文中。

Method: 构建包含超13K沙特商业法庭案件的ALARB数据集，定义挑战性任务，对阿拉伯语大语言模型进行基准测试并用于指令微调。

Result: 指令微调一个12B参数模型在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成方面性能显著提升，达到与GPT - 4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集对评估和提升阿拉伯语大语言模型在法律领域的推理能力有重要作用。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决搜索增强大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中因分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误导致可靠性有限的问题。

Method: 提出可擦除强化学习（ERL）框架，明确识别错误步骤、擦除并重新生成推理。

Result: 基于ERL训练的ESearch模型在多个数据集上显著优于先前SOTA结果，3B模型和7B模型的EM和F1指标均有提升。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为大语言模型的稳健多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有代码上下文修剪技术忽略代码特定结构和依赖，且代码生成存在高 API 成本和生成延迟问题。

Method: 提出 LongCodeZip 框架，采用粗粒度和细粒度压缩双阶段策略。

Result: 在代码完成、总结和问答等多任务评估中，LongCodeZip 始终优于基线方法，压缩比达 5.6 倍且不降低任务性能。

Conclusion: LongCodeZip 能有效减少上下文大小并保留关键信息，使大语言模型更好适应大规模代码场景，提升代码智能应用效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的机器学习方法依赖外部资源，不实际且可能引入隐私风险，需新方法。

Method: 提出直接令牌优化（DTO）方法，区分目标令牌和非目标令牌，分别用于优化遗忘目标和保持模型性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO在遗忘质量上比最新基线提高达16.8倍，同时保持相当的模型实用性。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效且自包含的大语言模型机器学习方法，无需外部资源且效果好。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

TL;DR: 当前大语言模型开发将任务解决和偏好对齐分开处理，在面向人类应用中存在问题，提出PREFDISCO评估方法，发现个性化推理需专门开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型开发范式在面向人类应用中，尤其是即时场景下，因未考虑用户偏好而存在不足，需实现个性化推理。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估方法，将静态基准转换为交互式个性化任务，使用有稀疏偏好的心理人物角色。

Result: 对21个前沿模型在10个任务上评估，29.0%的简单个性化尝试比通用响应偏好对齐效果更差，通用响应也无法有效满足个体需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发，PREFDISCO为开发适应个体用户的系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

Result: 对去偏性能在关键维度进行了系统比较和分析。

Conclusion: 将公开基准，旨在为去偏研究建立统一测试平台。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验显示，带RAG的ELMs性能始终优于非RAG基线。

Conclusion: 突出了关键的ELM设计考虑因素，代码开源。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 大语言模型在文本分类潜力未充分挖掘，用指令调优处理分类有困难，微调需大量昂贵且稀缺的标注数据。

Method: 引入即插即用的层级参数高效微调框架IR - Tuning，基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要层微调，冻结冗余层。

Conclusion: IR - Tuning框架能有效解决大语言模型文本分类问题，在文本修订分类上有良好表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

Motivation: 现有口语对话系统设计会丢弃副语言线索、限制表现力，端到端方法依赖文本中间环节有瓶颈。

Method: 结合基于模态的层拆分架构和冻结预训练策略，保留预训练文本大语言模型的推理和知识，增加原生语音能力。

Result: 模型在口语问答中达到了最先进的结果，语音到语音性能与现有文本引导系统相当，文本性能也有竞争力。

Conclusion: 缩小了文本引导和直接语音生成之间的差距，建立了新的端到端语音交互范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态数据集评估方法无法适应多模态大语言模型驱动代理发展，已有合成数据方法不适用于代理任务，且缺乏对网络环境多步交互的系统建模。

Method: 构建知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务，采用多阶段过滤管道保证任务质量和可执行性。

Result: Graph2Eval能高效生成任务，区分不同代理和模型性能，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网络交互的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为代理评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中LLMs语境忠实性问题，减少幻觉现象，提高可靠性。

Method: 两阶段高复制响应偏好训练得到CopyPasteLLM，设计三种提示方法提升复制度，提出Context - Parameter Copying Capturing算法。

Result: CopyPasteLLM在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上表现最佳，在FaithEval上比最佳基线准确率提高12.2% - 24.5%，仅需1/50的训练样本。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM能有效提升语境忠实性和幻觉控制能力，且在生成时重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Method: 提出SafePassage三步管道，包括LLM提取器、基于字符串的全局对齐器和评分模型。

Result: 三步结合最多减少85%的幻觉，与人类判断高度一致，小样本微调的编码器表现更优。

Conclusion: SafePassage管道可用于信息提取和评估大语言模型，小样本微调编码器有潜力。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

Result: 在80:10:10数据集划分下，BLSTM模型在测试集达到99.21%的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 此工作成果可应用于Tenyidie语言的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等众多NLP应用。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Motivation: 手动创建易读文本耗时耗力，需用大语言模型自动化生成。

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，探索多任务检索增强生成和参数高效微调两种策略。

Result: 多任务设置在各配置下优于单任务基线，RAG策略可在域外泛化，MTL - LoRA在域内表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多任务学习方法对自动化生成易读内容有效，不同策略适用于不同场景。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Result: PLMs表现与LLMs相当，能有效适应域外文本。

Conclusion: 基于ETR - fr数据集的方法在ETR文本生成上有一定效果，PLMs有良好表现。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

Result: 从22个欧洲议会录音中提取超61k小时对齐语音片段，19种语言超1k小时，22种语言超500小时；微调模型后字错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，构建的数据集对提升自动语音识别模型性能有用。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决监督微调在大语言模型后训练中泛化性有限的问题，探究默认训练目标NLL在该场景下的局限性。

Method: 研究基于概率的目标函数族，在7种模型骨干、14个基准和3个领域进行综合实验和消融研究，开展理论分析。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体这一关键维度，在模型能力强的一端，降低低概率标记权重的先验倾向目标函数优于NLL；在弱的一端，NLL占优；中间则无单一目标函数占优。

Conclusion: 为根据模型能力调整目标函数提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

Conclusion: Sci - SpanDet 框架能有效检测学术文献中 AI 生成文本，性能优越且跨领域表现良好，公开代码和数据集利于后续研究。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and
code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在分配稀缺社会资源时遵循的原则和价值观缺乏研究，需评估其分配能力。

Method: 引入社会福利函数（SWF）基准，构建动态模拟环境，让大语言模型作为分配者向不同接受者分配任务，评估20个最先进的大语言模型并制作排行榜。

Result: 模型的对话能力不能预测其分配技能；多数大语言模型有强烈的功利主义倾向，牺牲公平追求效率；分配策略易受输出长度限制和社会影响框架干扰。

Conclusion: 部署当前大语言模型作为社会决策者有风险，人工智能治理需要专业基准和针对性对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

Motivation: 传统RAG依赖静态数据库，适应性受限且可能产生无关示例，需更好的上下文支持方法。

Method: 提出GRAD方法，训练LLM模型为每个输入生成特定的简洁示例。

Result: 在数学推理和STEM问题上，GRAD在Qwen2.5 - 14B上始终优于强基线，能泛化到OOD领域，小模型生成的示例可有效指导大模型。

Conclusion: 引入可扩展的示例生成器模型，是资源受限环境下动态少样本学习范式的第一步，已发布代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

Motivation: 解决训练后对齐降低大语言模型多样性、导致模式崩溃的问题。

Method: 从数据层面分析出典型性偏差，提出Verbalized Sampling提示策略。

Result: Verbalized Sampling显著提升创意写作、对话模拟等任务表现，增加多样性，不牺牲事实准确性和安全性，能力更强的模型受益更多。

Conclusion: 提供了数据中心视角理解模式崩溃，并给出实用的推理时间解决方案以释放预训练生成多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

Motivation: 在欧盟引入董事会性别配额背景下，探究BGD对CEP的影响。

Method: 使用面板回归和先进机器学习算法分析2016 - 2022年欧洲企业数据，用结构方程模型（SEM）分析中介渠道。

Result: BGD与CEP呈显著非线性关系，最优水平约35%，最低阈值22%；ESG争议对二者关系无显著影响；环境创新不是BGD促进CEP的中介渠道。

Conclusion: 研究结果对学者、企业和监管者有启示意义。

Abstract: With the European Union introducing gender quotas on corporate boards, this
study investigates the impact of board gender diversity (BGD) on firms' carbon
emission performance (CEP). Using panel regressions and advanced machine
learning algorithms on data from European firms between 2016 and 2022, the
analyses reveal a significant non-linear relationship. Specifically, CEP
improves with BGD up to an optimal level of approximately 35 percent, beyond
which further increases in BGD yield no additional improvement in CEP. A
minimum threshold of 22 percent BGD is necessary for meaningful improvements in
CEP. To assess the legitimacy of CEP outcomes, this study examines whether ESG
controversies affect the relationship between BGD and CEP. The results show no
significant effect, suggesting that the effect of BGD is driven by governance
mechanisms rather than symbolic actions. Additionally, structural equation
modelling (SEM) indicates that while environmental innovation contributes to
CEP, it is not the mediating channel through which BGD promotes CEP. The
results have implications for academics, businesses, and regulators.

Conclusion: Object - AVEdit能有效实现对象级视听编辑，且在相关任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and
the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video
editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically,
object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object
addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities,
while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the
editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving
the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration
paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we
develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging
the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation
models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation
and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration
holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention
during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both
audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic
alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved
advanced performance. More results on our project page:

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent
seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide.
While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based
transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly
complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep
learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene
expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs
GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion
parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor
Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient
preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent
pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets
including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal
several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal
astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored
excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in
combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic
characterization in neurological diseases.

Conclusion: RoboPilot框架能有效应对现实动态环境中的复杂任务，具有更好的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 了解大语言模型解决复杂机器人问题的规划能力，明确其规划能力覆盖机器人任务空间的程度，解决LLM与TAMP集成系统设计复杂的问题。

Method: 开发16种使用Gemini 2.5 Flash替代关键TAMP组件的算法，进行零样本实验。

Result: Gemini-based规划器成功率更低、规划时间更长；提供几何细节比纯PDDL描述增加任务规划错误；非推理LLM变体多数情况下优于推理变体。

Conclusion: 在解决机器人问题上，当前Gemini-based规划器不如工程化方案，TAMP系统可引导LLM纠正错误。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

Conclusion: TGPO是解决一般STL任务的有效方法，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

Conclusion: DiSA - IQL能有效减轻离线RL中的分布偏移问题，代码开源利于软机器人控制的离线RL进一步研究。

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,
including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla
IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved
robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to
facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

Result: 在Franka机器人上的大量真实实验表明，Traj2Action在短和长视野真实任务上比基线分别提升27%和22.25%，且随人类数据增加，机器人策略学习有显著提升。

Conclusion: Traj2Action框架有效解决了人类到机器人的技能转移问题，提升了机器人操作技能学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video
demonstrations, is available at

Conclusion: 未明确给出，推测HyT框架能在不影响性能前提下减少推理时间，实现灵活输出。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于监测基于数据集训练的机器学习模型的能力，对自动驾驶中可信AI的部署至关重要。

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督学习的机器人操作策略在遇到训练未覆盖的执行变化时表现不佳，标准注意力机制未明确建模演示中的时间结构。

Method: 提出Cross - State Transition Attention Transformer，采用State Transition Attention (STA)机制调整注意力权重，训练时结合时间掩码。

Result: 在模拟评估中，STA在所有任务上始终优于标准交叉注意力和TCN、LSTM等时间建模方法，在精度关键任务上比交叉注意力提升超2倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能让机器人操作策略更好地根据执行历史调整行为，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Conclusion: GPC是利用现有策略提升控制性能的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

Abstract: The relative power of quantum algorithms, using an adaptive access to quantum
devices, versus classical post-processing methods that rely only on an initial
quantum data set, remains the subject of active debate. Here, we present
evidence for an exponential separation between adaptive and non-adaptive
strategies in a quantum circuit recompilation task. Our construction features
compilation problems with loss landscapes for discrete optimization that are
unimodal yet non-separable, a structure known in classical optimization to
confer exponential advantages to adaptive search. Numerical experiments show
that optimization can efficiently uncover hidden circuit structure operating in
the regime of volume-law entanglement and high-magic, while non-adaptive
approaches are seemingly limited to exhaustive search requiring exponential
resources. These results indicate that adaptive access to quantum hardware
provides a fundamental advantage.

### [362] [Query-Optimal Estimation of Unitary Channels via Pauli Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00168)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study process tomography of unitary channels whose Pauli spectrum is
supported on a small subgroup. Given query access to an unknown unitary channel
whose Pauli spectrum is supported on a subgroup of size $2^k$, our goal is to
output a classical description that is $\epsilon$-close to the unknown unitary
in diamond distance. We present an algorithm that achieves this using
$O(2^k/\epsilon)$ queries, and we prove matching lower bounds, establishing
query optimality of our algorithm. When $k = 2n$, so that the support is the
full Pauli group, our result recovers the query-optimal $O(4^n/\epsilon)$-query
algorithm of Haah, Kothari, O'Donnell, and Tang [FOCS '23].
  Our result has two notable consequences. First, we give a query-optimal
$O(4^k/\epsilon)$-query algorithm for learning quantum $k$-juntas -- unitary
channels that act non-trivially on only $k$ of the $n$ qubits -- to accuracy
$\epsilon$ in diamond distance. This represents an exponential improvement in
both query and time complexity over prior work.
  Second, we give a computationally efficient algorithm for learning
compositions of depth-$O(\log \log n)$ circuits with near-Clifford circuits,
where "near-Clifford" means a Clifford circuit augmented with at most $O(\log
n)$ non-Clifford single-qubit gates. This unifies prior work, which could
handle only constant-depth circuits or near-Clifford circuits, but not their
composition.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Pauli channel is a fundamental model of noise in quantum systems,
motivating the task of Pauli error estimation. We present an algorithm that
builds on the reduction to Population Recovery introduced in [FO21]. Addressing
an open question from that work, our algorithm has the key advantage of
robustness against even severe state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors.
To tolerate SPAM, we must analyze Population Recovery on a combined
erasure/bit-flip channel, which necessitates extending the complex analysis
techniques from [PSW17, DOS17]. For $n$-qubit channels, our Pauli error
estimation algorithm requires only $\exp(n^{1/3})$ unentangled state
preparations and measurements, improving on previous SPAM-tolerant algorithms
that had $2^n$-dependence even for restricted families of Pauli channels. We
also give evidence that no SPAM-tolerant method can make asymptotically fewer
than $\exp(n^{1/3})$ uses of the channel.

Conclusion: 基于JC和DJC的储层是时间序列处理的通用平台，可克服等效量子比特对的设置，为高性能量子机器学习架构提供途径。

Abstract: We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson
system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive
limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic
nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information
processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and
nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior
nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive
performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for
chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate
how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the
role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing
expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish
JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing
and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and
offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning
architectures.

Result: 稳定训练过程，加速收敛，提升图像质量，缓解模型崩溃问题，在各方面显著超越现有策略梯度基线。

Conclusion: PCPO框架有效解决了文本到图像模型训练中的问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决高光谱单图像超分辨率问题，提升性能并降低复杂度

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

Conclusion: 提出的RobustVLA能有效提升VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型通过指令调优控制行为困难，减少指令调优数据集预算常导致性能下降，现有启发式策略将模型视为黑盒，忽略潜在学习能力。

Method: CADC框架从基于梯度的学习轨迹中无监督地发现内在能力，通过影响估计将训练数据归因于这些能力，并通过平衡选择和分阶段排序编排课程。

Result: 使用仅5%的原始数据，CADC在多模态基准测试中超越全量数据训练。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本组成部分，CADC是指令数据编排的原则范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示多模态大语言模型提示词交易的安全风险，提出RLStealer框架窃取提示词模板，实验效果好，凸显安全威胁并为防护标准奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型推动提示词交易市场发展，但提示词存在被盗风险，当前该安全问题未受充分研究。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的提示词反转框架RLStealer，将模板窃取视为序列决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RLStealer达到了最先进的性能，将攻击总成本降至现有基线所需成本的13%以下，且能有效跨不同图像风格泛化以窃取未见提示词模板。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了提示词交易中固有的紧迫安全威胁，为新兴多模态大语言模型市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Explanation - Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT)方法验证视觉 - 语言模型，发现模型解释存在忠实性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉 - 语言模型生成的自然语言解释可能与预测的因果因素不匹配，存在技术和治理风险。

Method: 引入EDCT，将模型自身解释作为可证伪假设，对图像 - 问题对进行处理，包括获取答案和解释、解析解释为可测试视觉概念、生成反事实编辑、计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK - VQA示例和多个视觉 - 语言模型上，EDCT发现了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计工件。

Conclusion: EDCT能有效验证视觉 - 语言模型，发现其解释的忠实性问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

TL;DR: 现有多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像理解上表现不佳，归因常为感知局限，本文发现是复杂背景干扰，提出无训练框架HiDe，取得SOTA效果且减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳的问题，纠正对问题成因的传统认知。

Method: 通过一系列解耦实验分析“放大”操作，提出Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe)，利用Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD)和解耦目标视觉区域与背景的Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD)。

Result: HiDe在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到SOTA，提升Qwen2.5 - VL 7B和InternVL3 8B性能，超越RL方法，优化后比之前无训练方法减少75%内存使用。

Conclusion: 复杂背景干扰是多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳的主因，HiDe框架有效解决该问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 充分利用空间信息进行遥感图像分割，解决灰度变化导致的语义边缘模糊问题。

Method: 采用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和语义细节；用FFT集成全局和频域信息；用Haar小波变换分解特征以细化边界分割。

Result: 模型在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Conclusion: 该工作引入的模型能实现基本驾驶行为，为更强大的自动驾驶代理发展奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文提出用于压缩CNN的端到端DSE方法和框架，解决LRF压缩DNN的挑战，实验表明该方法压缩效果好且精度损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRF压缩DNN面临最优秩选择、设计空间大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题。

Method: 引入基于特征图相似度的秩选择策略，采用一次性微调，框架兼容所有卷积和全连接层，集成多种LRF技术并按层选择应用。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上实验，该方法实现大幅压缩且精度损失小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 结合多种LRF方法比单一方法效果好，提出的工作集成到TensorFlow 2.x，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa

maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Conclusion: 所提出的利用DWT增强VAE潜在空间表示的方法是有效的。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Conclusion: 所提出的基准和模型为开发应对现实挑战的轨迹预测系统提供关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性。

Conclusion: SCNet能有效优化自监督成对噪声图像去噪。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Motivation: 现有基于图像的迭代方法选择的特征提取技术可能导致不同矩阵有相同图像表示，影响选择结果。

Method: 引入RAF技术，同时提取图像表示作为相对特征和对应数值作为绝对特征并融合。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上评估，稀疏线性系统求解时间减少0.08s - 0.29s，比传统方法快5.86% - 11.50%，达SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RAF技术能提升基于图像的迭代方法选择准确性，挖掘其潜力。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

Motivation: 生成模型可大规模生成逼真图像，现有水印方法存在易受攻击、更新成本高的问题。

Method: 提出将编码问题表述为生成模型参数的依赖于密钥的扰动的通用水印框架，引入基于路由的Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM)方法。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能在多种攻击下实现鲁棒的密钥恢复。

Conclusion: MOLM设计避免了特定密钥的重新训练，实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等特性。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Conclusion: Forestpest - YOLO检测框架有效解决了林业遥感图像害虫检测的难题，性能优越。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD - Discover通过最大化SCG函数挖掘未知实例，CROWD - Learn采用组合目标分离已知和未知表示。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M - OWODB和S - OWODB上已知类别准确率分别提高2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率是领先基线的近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD框架能有效解决OWOD中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，提升检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Result: 在PASCAL - Context基准测试统一训练设置下，ASE在不同配置中持续提升性能

Conclusion: ASE能有效促进单任务到多任务学习过渡，增强专家专业化与合作，细粒度设计对多任务学习有效

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Conclusion: 新损失函数MFD能有效加速一致性模型训练，在小批量训练场景也表现良好。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Result: 通过大量严重退化情况下的实验对工作有效性进行了全面分析。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效解决极端盲图像恢复问题，且具有一定灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Conclusion: MULTI - TAP是一个有效的图文对齐评估工具，新数据集EYE4ALL可助力开发更易访问的AI系统。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

Result: 提出的框架能基于输入与学习到的原型的偏差，对不确定或异常输入进行共形预测。

Conclusion: 所提方法增强了CBMs的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

Conclusion: MetaLogic高效、可扩展，能发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and

Conclusion: 给出未来工作的建议并引入公开排行榜用于基准测试。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Motivation: 常见生成式AI图像方法忽视几何结构，仅关注概率方法，本研究旨在统一几何与概率视角。

Method: 提供几何框架和基于核的概率方法，构建Manifold - Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM)。

Result: Latent MPPM (LMPPM)在多个数据集上的图像恢复和生成效果优于Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)。

Conclusion: 统一几何与概率视角的框架有效，构建的MPPM模型具有良好性能。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

TL;DR: 研究将世界模型先验迁移到视觉语言模型的能力，提出世界语言模型（WorldLMs），其生成编码器有别于传统编码器，最佳变体DyVA表现出色，还探索了未来模型设计方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着强大视频基础模型出现，探讨其是否能取代传统视觉编码器范式用于通用多模态理解，且现有研究缺乏对通用多模态任务的系统研究。

Method: 将视频扩散模型重新用作生成编码器进行单次去噪步骤，将得到的潜在特征作为视觉嵌入，实证研究此类世界语言模型。

Result: 生成编码器能捕获对下游理解有用的潜在特征，DyVA显著增强空间推理能力，使单图像模型能进行多帧推理，在视觉推理任务上超越多个基线。

Conclusion: 这些成果归因于WorldLM从视频预训练中继承的运动一致性内化，研究为利用世界模型先验的新型视觉语言模型发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

Motivation: 解决Transformers处理长序列的局限、传统VSR方法的问题以及Mamba难捕捉细粒度空间依赖的问题。

Method: 提出混合架构，结合移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合和Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时间传播；引入Gather - Scatter Mamba（GSM）机制。

Result: 未提及具体实验结果，但提出方法可减少遮挡伪影，确保信息有效重新分配。

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构和GSM机制能改善视频超分辨率任务中的问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Conclusion: AI - CNet3D模型能有效提升青光眼分类性能，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Conclusion: TextCAM是一种有效的解释框架，能解决CAM缺乏语义洞察的问题，提高模型解释性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉处理的人脸图像存在隐私和安全风险，当前人脸匿名化方法难以在安全方案、高质量图像生成和可逆性之间取得良好平衡。

Method: 将密钥与扩散模型的潜在人脸表示相结合，用面部掩码约束生成以保留无关特征，使用确定性的前后向扩散过程。

Result: 所提方法生成的匿名化人脸与原始人脸视觉相似度更低。

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的、安全的、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化方法。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Motivation: 重新定义先前的伪离散方法，解决传统伪离散扩散方法依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略的问题。

Method: 直接在one - hot空间通过协调机制保留核心扩散特征，使用float编码的one - hot类数据重构扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失。

Result: 在分类任务上比基线表现好，在图像字幕生成中有出色文本生成能力，消融实验验证各组件有显著增益。

Conclusion: ADD框架有效，建立了判别式和生成式学习的桥梁。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Result: Code2Video是可扩展、可解释和可控的方法，比直接代码生成提升40%，生成视频与人工教程相当。

Conclusion: Code2Video在教育视频生成方面具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Conclusion: 分析了游泳尾随效益、风险暴露和群体规模与异质有效成本参数和均衡努力的关系。

Abstract: This paper introduces a contest-theoretic simplified model of triathlon as a
sequential two-stage game. In Stage 1 (post-swim), participants decide whether
to continue or withdraw from the contest, thereby generating an endogenous
participation decision. In Stage 2 (bike-run), competition is represented as a
Tullock contest in which swim drafting acts as a multiplicative shifter of
quadratic effort costs. Closed-form equilibrium strategies are derived in the
two-player case, and existence, uniqueness, and comparative statics are shown
in the asymmetric n-player case. The continuation decision yields
athlete-specific cutoff rules in swim drafting intensity and induces
subgame-perfect equilibria (SPEs) with endogenous participation sets. The
analysis relates swim drafting benefits, exposure, and group size to
heterogeneous effective cost parameters and equilibrium efforts.

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning deals with training a novice policy from
expert demonstrations in an online fashion. The established DAgger algorithm
trains a robust novice policy by alternating between interacting with the
environment and retraining of the network. Many variants thereof exist, that
differ in the method of discerning whether to allow the novice to act or return
control to the expert. We propose the use of stochastic reachtubes - common in
verification of dynamical systems - as a novel method for estimating the
necessity of expert intervention. Our approach does not require fine-tuning of
decision thresholds per environment and effectively reduces the number of
expert interventions, especially when compared with related approaches that
make use of a doubt classification model.

Conclusion: 提出的GeoGraph方法提供了预测IDP构象集合的新途径，具有更好的预测性能。

Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized the prediction of rigid protein
structures, modelling the conformational ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered
Proteins (IDPs) remains a key frontier. Current AI paradigms present a
trade-off: Protein Language Models (PLMs) capture evolutionary statistics but
lack explicit physical grounding, while generative models trained to model full
ensembles are computationally expensive. In this work we critically assess
these limits and propose a path forward. We introduce GeoGraph, a
simulation-informed surrogate trained to predict ensemble-averaged statistics
of residue-residue contact-map topology directly from sequence. By featurizing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations into residue- and sequence-level
graph descriptors, we create a robust and information-rich learning target. Our
evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields representations that are more
predictive of key biophysical properties than existing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能解决高维模型中变量选择和推理问题，可扩展到高维场景。

Abstract: Simultaneously performing variable selection and inference in
high-dimensional models is an open challenge in statistics and machine
learning. The increasing availability of vast amounts of variables requires the
adoption of specific statistical procedures to accurately select the most
important predictors in a high-dimensional space, while being able to control
some form of selection error. In this work we adapt the Mirror Statistic
approach to False Discovery Rate (FDR) control into a Bayesian modelling
framework. The Mirror Statistic, developed in the classic frequentist
statistical framework, is a flexible method to control FDR, which only requires
mild model assumptions, but requires two sets of independent regression
coefficient estimates, usually obtained after splitting the original dataset.
Here we propose to rely on a Bayesian formulation of the model and use the
posterior distributions of the coefficients of interest to build the Mirror
Statistic and effectively control the FDR without the need to split the data.
Moreover, the method is very flexible since it can be used with continuous and
discrete outcomes and more complex predictors, such as with mixed models. We
keep the approach scalable to high-dimensions by relying on Automatic
Differentiation Variational Inference and fully continuous prior choices.

Abstract: Many Bayesian network modelling applications suffer from the issue of data
scarcity. Hence the use of expert judgement often becomes necessary to
determine the parameters of the conditional probability tables (CPTs)
throughout the network. There are usually a prohibitively large number of these
parameters to determine, even when complementing any available data with expert
judgements. To address this challenge, a number of CPT approximation methods
have been developed that reduce the quantity and complexity of parameters
needing to be determined to fully parameterise a Bayesian network. This paper
provides a review of a variety of structural refinement methods that can be
used in practice to efficiently approximate a CPT within a Bayesian network. We
not only introduce and discuss the intrinsic properties and requirements of
each method, but we evaluate each method through a worked example on a Bayesian
network model of cardiovascular risk assessment. We conclude with practical
guidance to help Bayesian network practitioners choose an alternative approach
when direct parameterisation of a CPT is infeasible.

Abstract: Standard techniques for differentially private estimation, such as Laplace or
Gaussian noise addition, require guaranteed bounds on the sensitivity of the
estimator in question. But such sensitivity bounds are often large or simply
unknown. Thus we seek differentially private methods that can be applied to
arbitrary black-box functions. A handful of such techniques exist, but all are
either inefficient in their use of data or require evaluating the function on
exponentially many inputs. In this work we present a scheme that trades off
between statistical efficiency (i.e., how much data is needed) and oracle
efficiency (i.e., the number of evaluations). We also present lower bounds
showing the near-optimality of our scheme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞检测方法存在上下文理解不足、单轮交互受限和评估粗粒度等问题，需改进。

Method: 设计漏洞分析智能体，利用工具使用能力和上下文推理挖掘漏洞模式；通过跨角色智能体交互迭代反馈和细化决策；引入多维度真实信息进行细粒度评估。

Result: 在成对漏洞数据集上实验表明，MAVUL成对准确率比现有多智能体系统高62%以上，平均性能比单智能体系统高600%以上，增加智能体通信轮次可提高系统有效性。

Conclusion: MAVUL性能优越，上下文推理对追踪漏洞流很重要，集成评估智能体可确保系统评估准确可靠。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of open-source software (OSS) necessitates the
mitigation of vulnerability risks. Most vulnerability detection (VD) methods
are limited by inadequate contextual understanding, restrictive single-round
interactions, and coarse-grained evaluations, resulting in undesired model
performance and biased evaluation results. To address these challenges, we
propose MAVUL, a novel multi-agent VD system that integrates contextual
reasoning and interactive refinement. Specifically, a vulnerability analyst
agent is designed to flexibly leverage tool-using capabilities and contextual
reasoning to achieve cross-procedural code understanding and effectively mine
vulnerability patterns. Through iterative feedback and refined decision-making
within cross-role agent interactions, the system achieves reliable reasoning
and vulnerability prediction. Furthermore, MAVUL introduces multi-dimensional
ground truth information for fine-grained evaluation, thereby enhancing
evaluation accuracy and reliability.
  Extensive experiments conducted on a pairwise vulnerability dataset
demonstrate MAVUL's superior performance. Our findings indicate that MAVUL
significantly outperforms existing multi-agent systems with over 62% higher
pairwise accuracy and single-agent systems with over 600% higher average
performance. The system's effectiveness is markedly improved with increased
communication rounds between the vulnerability analyst agent and the security
architect agent, underscoring the importance of contextual reasoning in tracing
vulnerability flows and the crucial feedback role. Additionally, the integrated
evaluation agent serves as a critical, unbiased judge, ensuring a more accurate
and reliable estimation of the system's real-world applicability by preventing
misleading binary comparisons.

TL;DR: 本文提出针对配备AI硬件加速器无线设备的新型攻击，分两阶段偷取模型权重，通过硬件演示验证，分析影响并探讨防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型开发成本高、具竞争优势且涉及专有技术，模型窃取攻击对提供者构成严重威胁。

Method: 攻击分两阶段，第一阶段植入硬件木马通过隐蔽信道泄露模型权重，第二阶段用附近无线设备截获传输帧并重构权重矩阵，与模型架构和硬件加速器无关。

Result: 通过涉及四种不同类型和大小AI模型的硬件演示验证方法，分析误码率影响并提出缓解技术，评估攻击有效性。

Conclusion: 研究该新型攻击并探索潜在防御机制。

Abstract: AI models are often regarded as valuable intellectual property due to the
high cost of their development, the competitive advantage they provide, and the
proprietary techniques involved in their creation. As a result, AI model
stealing attacks pose a serious concern for AI model providers. In this work,
we present a novel attack targeting wireless devices equipped with AI hardware
accelerators. The attack unfolds in two phases. In the first phase, the
victim's device is compromised with a hardware Trojan (HT) designed to covertly
leak model weights through a hidden communication channel, without the victim
realizing it. In the second phase, the adversary uses a nearby wireless device
to intercept the victim's transmission frames during normal operation and
incrementally reconstruct the complete weight matrix. The proposed attack is
agnostic to both the AI model architecture and the hardware accelerator used.
We validate our approach through a hardware-based demonstration involving four
diverse AI models of varying types and sizes. We detail the design of the HT
and the covert channel, highlighting their stealthy nature. Additionally, we
analyze the impact of bit error rates on the reception and propose an error
mitigation technique. The effectiveness of the attack is evaluated based on the
accuracy of the reconstructed models with stolen weights and the time required
to extract them. Finally, we explore potential defense mechanisms.

Result: 在四个LVLM代理、多个场景及真实机器人车辆上实验，CHAI始终优于现有攻击。

Conclusion: CHAI凸显超越传统对抗鲁棒性防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in
robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning
grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions
and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also
create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking
against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the
multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models
(LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as
misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space,
builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual
Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing,
autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle.
Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of
next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for
defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.

TL;DR: 提出用于网络安全应用的改进语言模型SecureBERT 2.0，在多基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用语言模型缺乏网络安全领域特定适配，难以高精度分析网络安全和威胁情报数据。

Method: 基于ModernBERT架构，引入改进的长上下文建模和分层编码，在特定领域语料库上预训练。

Result: 在多个网络安全基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，在威胁情报语义搜索等任务上有显著改进。

Conclusion: SecureBERT 2.0能有效处理网络安全领域的扩展和异构文档，可提升相关任务的性能。

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands
language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document
structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code.
Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust
representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical
entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat
detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However,
general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation
required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced
encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications.
Leveraging the ModernBERT architecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved
long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing
of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source
code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times
larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53
million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat
intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity
recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the
cybersecurity domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型易受提示注入等攻击，需安全优先的AI范式来缓解其漏洞并提升性能。

Result: 实验显示模型安全和性能显著提升，精确率、召回率和F1分数约为94%。

Conclusion: PromptShield框架可缓解对抗威胁，提升系统性能和可靠性，适用于多领域，为AI安全标准和政策发展提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread prominence, yet their
vulnerability to prompt injection and other adversarial attacks remains a
critical concern. This paper argues for a security-by-design AI paradigm that
proactively mitigates LLM vulnerabilities while enhancing performance. To
achieve this, we introduce PromptShield, an ontology-driven framework that
ensures deterministic and secure prompt interactions. It standardizes user
inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating
adversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance
capabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze
cloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events
related to malicious activities and anomalies. By simulating prompt injection
attacks and assessing the impact of deploying PromptShield, our results
demonstrate a significant improvement in model security and performance,
achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 94%. Notably, the
ontology-based framework not only mitigates adversarial threats but also
enhances the overall performance and reliability of the system. Furthermore,
PromptShield's modular and adaptable design ensures its applicability beyond
cloud security, making it a robust solution for safeguarding generative AI
applications across various domains. By laying the groundwork for AI safety
standards and informing future policy development, this work stimulates a
crucial dialogue on the pivotal role of deterministic prompt engineering and
ontology-based validation in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of
LLMs in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in domains including
cloud security and forensics. Yet cloud forensic investigations still rely on
manual analysis, making them time-consuming and error-prone. LLMs can mimic
human reasoning, offering a pathway to automating cloud log analysis. To
address this, we introduce the Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF),
an ontology-driven framework that systematically investigates cloud forensic
logs while improving efficiency and accuracy. CIAF standardizes user inputs
through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring consistency in
log interpretation. This not only enhances data quality but also provides
investigators with reliable, standardized information for decision-making. To
evaluate security and performance, we analyzed Microsoft Azure logs containing
ransomware-related events. By simulating attacks and assessing CIAF's impact,
results showed significant improvement in ransomware detection, achieving
precision, recall, and F1 scores of 93 percent. CIAF's modular, adaptable
design extends beyond ransomware, making it a robust solution for diverse
cyberattacks. By laying the foundation for standardized forensic methodologies
and informing future AI-driven automation, this work underscores the role of
deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in enhancing
cloud forensic investigations. These advancements improve cloud security while
paving the way for efficient, automated forensic workflows.

TL;DR: 提出LatentSeal将水印嵌入重新构建为语义通信，能隐藏完整句子消息，突破容量上限，具备多种优势并提供AI治理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数图像水印系统以比特为中心限制了容量且无法携带有用信息。

Method: 用轻量级文本自动编码器将完整句子消息映射为256维单位范数潜在向量，通过微调水印模型嵌入并通过秘密可逆旋转保护。

Result: 系统能实时解码，能抵御攻击，在多个基准测试中超越现有技术，突破256位有效负载上限，ROC AUC分数达0.97 - 0.99。

Conclusion: 从比特有效负载转向语义潜在向量，使水印不仅鲁棒、高容量，还安全、可解释，为AI治理提供路径。

Abstract: Most image watermarking systems focus on robustness, capacity, and
imperceptibility while treating the embedded payload as meaningless bits. This
bit-centric view imposes a hard ceiling on capacity and prevents watermarks
from carrying useful information. We propose LatentSeal, which reframes
watermarking as semantic communication: a lightweight text autoencoder maps
full-sentence messages into a compact 256-dimensional unit-norm latent vector,
which is robustly embedded by a finetuned watermark model and secured through a
secret, invertible rotation. The resulting system hides full-sentence messages,
decodes in real time, and survives valuemetric and geometric attacks. It
surpasses prior state of the art in BLEU-4 and Exact Match on several
benchmarks, while breaking through the long-standing 256-bit payload ceiling.
It also introduces a statistically calibrated score that yields a ROC AUC score
of 0.97-0.99, and practical operating points for deployment. By shifting from
bit payloads to semantic latent vectors, LatentSeal enables watermarking that
is not only robust and high-capacity, but also secure and interpretable,
providing a concrete path toward provenance, tamper explanation, and
trustworthy AI governance. Models, training and inference code, and data splits
will be available upon publication.

Motivation: 解决入侵检测系统面临的网络攻击演变、高维流量数据和数据集类别不平衡问题。

Method: 提出IntrusionX框架，集成CNN和LSTM，用SSA优化，结合严格预处理、分层数据拆分和动态类加权。

Result: 在NSL - KDD上，二分类准确率98%，5分类准确率87%，少数类召回率有显著提升。

Conclusion: IntrusionX具有可重现、考虑不平衡且有元启发式优化的新颖设计。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face persistent challenges due to evolving
cyberattacks, high-dimensional traffic data, and severe class imbalance in
benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD. To address these issues, we propose
IntrusionX, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks for temporal modeling. The architecture is further optimized
using the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), enabling effective hyperparameter
tuning while maintaining computational efficiency. Our pipeline incorporates
rigorous preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and dynamic class weighting
to enhance the detection of rare classes. Experimental evaluation on NSL-KDD
demonstrates that IntrusionX achieves 98% accuracy in binary classification and
87% in 5-class classification, with significant improvements in minority class
recall (U2R: 71%, R2L: 93%). The novelty of IntrusionX lies in its
reproducible, imbalance-aware design with metaheuristic optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测和溯源AI生成图像方法无法确定可疑图像是否从特定基础图像编辑而来，有研究空白。

Method: 基于编辑过程四个关键观察，提出新的重新编辑策略，利用精心设计的相似度指标。

Result: 在五个先进编辑模型和六个数据集上评估，始终能准确检测和溯源，显著优于五个基线方法。

Conclusion: EditTrack框架可有效解决图像编辑检测和溯源问题。

Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection
and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to
determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an
AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing
model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated
images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether
an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a
particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first
framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on
four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel
re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to
determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so,
by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models
across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate
detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

Motivation: 识别冲突相关话语立场，研究媒体和算法偏见对数字对话的影响。

Method: 采用混合研究方法，定量阶段用自然语言处理和机器学习模型分类评论，定性阶段进行媒体背景和意识形态叙事的批判性分析。

Result: 亲巴勒斯坦和反美/以话语过度呈现，亲美和反巴勒斯坦立场边缘化，伊朗在数字对话中成为核心角色，证实算法偏见影响。

Conclusion: 结合计算分析和哲学批判研究数字争议，提供可在地缘政治背景复制的方法框架，凸显常被忽视的不对称和叙事争议。

Abstract: Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel
conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on
YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors
involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital
conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was
adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and
machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments
into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media
context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual
annotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of
statistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions.
The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and
anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and
anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in
global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the
conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks.
Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying
certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work
combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of
digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in
geopolitical contexts. It is one of the first Spanish-language studies to map,
through artificial intelligence and critical analysis, discourses on an
international conflict on YouTube, highlighting asymmetries and narrative
disputes that are often overlooked.

Motivation: 大语言模型为跨学科研究自动化带来新机遇，流行病建模复杂，适合利用大语言模型驱动自动化。

Method: 引入EpidemIQs框架，包含科学家智能体和任务专家智能体，用GPT 4.1和GPT 4.1 mini作大语言模型骨干，评估该框架不同场景表现并与单智能体模型对比。

Result: 框架能生成完整科学报告，平均总令牌使用量870K，每项研究成本约1.57美元，成功率达100%，不同场景表现优于单智能体模型。

Conclusion: EpidemIQs显著降低科研成本和周转时间，增强高级建模工具可及性，推动科研加速发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to automate complex
interdisciplinary research domains. Epidemic modeling, characterized by its
complexity and reliance on network science, dynamical systems, epidemiology,
and stochastic simulations, represents a prime candidate for leveraging
LLM-driven automation. We introduce \textbf{EpidemIQs}, a novel multi-agent LLM
framework that integrates user inputs and autonomously conducts literature
review, analytical derivation, network modeling, mechanistic modeling,
stochastic simulations, data visualization and analysis, and finally
documentation of findings in a structured manuscript. We introduced two types
of agents: a scientist agent for planning, coordination, reflection, and
generation of final results, and a task-expert agent to focus exclusively on
one specific duty serving as a tool to the scientist agent. The framework
consistently generated complete reports in scientific article format.
Specifically, using GPT 4.1 and GPT 4.1 mini as backbone LLMs for scientist and
task-expert agents, respectively, the autonomous process completed with average
total token usage 870K at a cost of about \$1.57 per study, achieving a 100\%
completion success rate through our experiments. We evaluate EpidemIQs across
different epidemic scenarios, measuring computational cost, completion success
rate, and AI and human expert reviews of generated reports. We compare
EpidemIQs to the single-agent LLM, which has the same system prompts and tools,
iteratively planning, invoking tools, and revising outputs until task
completion. The comparison shows consistently higher performance of the
proposed framework across five different scenarios. EpidemIQs represents a step
forward in accelerating scientific research by significantly reducing costs and
turnaround time of discovery processes, and enhancing accessibility to advanced
modeling tools.

Motivation: 许多基于GNN的社交推荐方法缺乏对预测结果提供有意义解释的能力。

Method: 提出SoREX框架，采用双塔结构并结合朋友推荐，独立建模社交关系和用户 - 项目交互，联合优化辅助任务；提出自我路径提取方法，将目标用户的自我网络转化为多跳自我路径集合，提取特定因素和候选感知的自我路径子集作为解释，并进行解释重新聚合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的综合实验验证了SoREX预测准确性，定性和定量分析证实其提取解释的有效性。

Conclusion: SoREX在社交推荐中能有效提高预测准确性，且提取的解释是有效的。

Abstract: Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity
in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent
integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction
accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many
GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish
meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this
challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social
recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend
recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item
interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social
signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction
approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a
collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and
candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the
summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate
items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct
explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream
predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets
validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally,
qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted
explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 传统社区检测方法无法捕捉市场中实体同步 - 不同步模式，解释科技巨头在市场干扰时响应模式差异。

Method: 引入FTSCommDetector，采用Temporal Coherence Architecture（TCA），通过双尺度编码和带动态注意力的静态拓扑保持连贯性，建立信息论基础，引入Normalized Temporal Profiles（NTP）。

Result: FTSCommDetector在四个金融市场上比最强基线有3.5% - 11.1%的提升，窗口大小变化时性能仅波动2%。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性，无需针对数据集调参，为投资组合构建和风险管理提供实用见解。

Abstract: Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different
response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector
classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional
community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization
patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments.
To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence
Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous
multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp
independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving
relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and
static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish
information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes
complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for
scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent
improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000,
Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest
baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2%
performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making
dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio
construction and risk management.

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with many
applications in various fields. Extending community detection to the temporal
setting with exact temporal accuracy, as required by real-world dynamic data,
necessitates methods specifically adapted to the temporal nature of
interactions. We introduce LAGO, a novel method for uncovering dynamic
communities by greedy optimization of Longitudinal Modularity, a specific
adaptation of Modularity for continuous-time networks. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on time discretization or assume rigid community evolution, LAGO
captures the precise moments when nodes enter and exit communities. We evaluate
LAGO on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability
to efficiently uncover temporally and topologically coherent communities.

Abstract: In 2025, Large Language Model (LLM) services have launched a new feature --
AI video chat -- allowing users to interact with AI agents via real-time video
communication (RTC), just like chatting with real people. Despite its
significance, no systematic study has characterized the performance of existing
AI video chat systems. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive
benchmark with carefully designed metrics across four dimensions: quality,

identifies unique system bottlenecks. In the meantime, our benchmarking results
also open up several research questions for future optimizations of AI video

TL;DR: 提出结合模拟和真实数据的混合方法，用少量真实数据微调预训练模型提升性能，实验大幅降低包延迟预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于机器学习的网络模型需大量训练数据，从真实网络收集成本高且受限，使用模拟数据会降低模型在真实环境中的准确性。

Method: 采用迁移学习的混合方法，用少量真实数据集对预训练模型（RouteNet - Fermi）进行微调。

Result: 使用OMNeT++和自定义测试床实验，包延迟预测的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）最多降低88%，10个真实场景下MAPE降低37%，50个场景下降低48%。

Conclusion: 用少量真实数据微调预训练模型能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based network models provide fast and accurate
predictions for complex network behaviors but require substantial training
data. Collecting such data from real networks is often costly and limited,
especially for critical scenarios like failures. As a result, researchers
commonly rely on simulated data, which reduces accuracy when models are
deployed in real environments. We propose a hybrid approach leveraging transfer
learning to combine simulated and real-world data. Using RouteNet-Fermi, we
show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a small real dataset
significantly improves performance. Our experiments with OMNeT++ and a custom
testbed reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in packet delay
prediction by up to 88%. With just 10 real scenarios, MAPE drops by 37%, and
with 50 scenarios, by 48%.

Motivation: 现有基准无法捕捉天文数据复杂性，需评估MLLM在天文图像理解中的表现。

Method: 引入AstroMMBench，含621道选择题，由15位专家审核，用其评估25个模型。

Result: Ovis2 - 34B整体准确率最高达70.5%，不同子领域表现有差异。

Conclusion: 特定领域基准对评估MLLM性能和指导科学应用开发至关重要，AstroMMBench可推动AI与天文交叉发展。

Abstract: Astronomical image interpretation presents a significant challenge for
applying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized scientific
tasks. Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to
capture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in
astronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice
questions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain
experts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25
diverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using
AstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall
accuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong
closed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six
astrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like
cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively
better in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These
findings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like
AstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their
targeted development for scientific applications. AstroMMBench provides a
foundational resource and a dynamic tool to catalyze advancements at the
intersection of AI and astronomy.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for detecting and
estimating boundaries in treatment effects across both spatial and temporal
dimensions. We formalize the concept of treatment effect boundaries as
structural parameters characterizing regime transitions where causal effects
cease to operate. Building on diffusion-based models of information
propagation, we establish conditions under which spatial and temporal
boundaries share common dynamics, derive identification results, and propose
consistent estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance of
our methods under various data-generating processes. The framework provides
tools for detecting when local treatments become systemic and identifying
critical thresholds for policy intervention.

Motivation: 机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）需大量原子结构数据，而哈密顿矩阵H中的大量数据未被利用，期望利用这些数据改进训练。

Method: 引入HELM模型以实现哈密顿预测与通用MLIPs的衔接；发布数据集OMol_CSH_58k；提出哈密顿预训练方法以在有限原子结构数据下提取原子环境描述符。

Result: 展示了电子相互作用数据作为丰富且可转移数据源在表示化学空间方面的应用。

Conclusion: 电子相互作用数据可作为有价值的数据来源用于原子级属性训练，能在低数据情况下提升能量预测性能。

Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic
structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to
improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of
accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far
gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the
orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level
properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure
Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which
bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling
to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis
sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated
Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental
diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set
(def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to
extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited
number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve
performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the
use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for
representing chemical space.

Conclusion: 该模型可补充国家地壳模型，支持基于物理的地震动模拟和同震灾害评估等应用。

Abstract: Earthquake ground motions and the related damage can be significantly
impacted by near-surface soils. Accurate predictions of seismic hazard require
depth-continuous models of soil stiffness, commonly described in terms of
shear-wave velocity (VS). For regional-scale studies, efforts to predict VS
remotely, such as the U.S. Geological Survey's National Crustal Model, tend to
emphasize deeper lithologic velocity structures, thus simplifying important
near-surface soil velocity variations, and tend to be produced at relatively
coarse geospatial resolution for one geographic area. In this study, we define
a functional form to describe VS-with-depth across the conterminous U.S. We
calibrate the parameters of the function using a national compilation of more
than 9,000 in-situ geotechnical measurements. By coupling the parametric
framework with geospatial machine learning, the model can be leveraged to
provide consistent, high resolution VS-depth predictions of the near-surface
geotechnical layer across the U.S., complementing the National Crustal Model
and supporting applications such as physics-based ground motion simulations and
coseismic hazard assessments.

Abstract: In the locust's lobula giant movement detector neural pathways, four
categories of inhibition, i.e., global inhibition, self-inhibition, lateral
inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition, have been functionally explored in the
context of looming perception. However, their combined influence on shaping
selectivity to looming motion remains unclear. Driven by recent physiological
advancements, this paper offers new insights into the roles of these inhibitory
mechanisms at multiple levels and scales in simulations, refining the specific
selectivity for responding only to objects approaching the eyes while remaining
unresponsive to other forms of movement. Within a feed-forward, multi-layer
neural network framework, global inhibition, lateral inhibition,
self-inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition are integrated. Global inhibition
acts as an immediate feedback mechanism, normalising light intensities
delivered by ommatidia, particularly addressing low-contrast looming.
Self-inhibition, modelled numerically for the first time, suppresses
translational motion. Lateral inhibition is formed by delayed local excitation
spreading across a larger area. Notably, self-inhibition and lateral inhibition
are sequential in time and are combined through feed-forward inhibition, which
indicates the angular size subtended by moving objects. Together, these
inhibitory processes attenuate motion-induced excitation at multiple levels and
scales. This research suggests that self-inhibition may act earlier than
lateral inhibition to rapidly reduce excitation in situ, thereby suppressing
translational motion, and global inhibition can modulate excitation on a finer
scale, enhancing selectivity in higher contrast range.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection systems are essential for ensuring the performance and
longevity of industrial assets. Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated
significant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited
to digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world
environments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions
are two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous
drone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function
executions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual
inspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial
readouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a
head agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The
head agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker
agents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.
Operating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,
evaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation
(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,
locating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a
feedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives
while preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated
environment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and
quantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and
workflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent
communication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible
alternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous
problem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has enabled sophisticated multi-agent
systems, yet coordinating their reasoning capabilities through prompt
engineering remains challenging. We present a theoretically-grounded framework
for dynamic prompt orchestration that enhances reasoning across multiple
specialized agents. This framework addresses three core challenges: logical
consistency preservation during agent transitions, reasoning-aware prompt
adaptation, and scalable coordination of distributed inference.
  Our approach formalizes agent states using prompt templates, reasoning
context vectors, and capability matrices. We prove system convergence to stable
coordination patterns when step sizes satisfy $\alpha < \frac{1}{2L}$ where $L$
is the Lipschitz constant of the state transition function. We implement this
through a distributed architecture that dynamically routes reasoning tasks
while maintaining semantic coherence.
  Experimental results on 1,000 synthetic multi-agent conversations demonstrate
a 42% reduction in reasoning latency, a 23% improvement in logical consistency
measured by ROUGE-L score, and an 89% success rate for task completion without
context loss across agent transitions. Ablation studies identify the consensus
mechanism as the primary performance driver, while revealing limitations:
performance degrades beyond 10 agent transitions, and the system requires
76.5GB memory for 1,000 concurrent agents. These findings establish a new
paradigm for scalable reasoning in multi-agent systems, providing theoretical
foundations for understanding reasoning emergence across coordinated language
models.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the
potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However,
this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between
agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure
between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches
rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,
or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,
we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication
on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and
assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of
the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message
transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically
updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.
Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without
additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg
framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account
the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak
LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak
regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple
agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses
naturally dominate the information flow.

Abstract: In this short paper, we present work evaluating an AI agent's understanding
of spoken conversations about data visualizations in an online meeting
scenario. There is growing interest in the development of AI-assistants that
support meetings, such as by providing assistance with tasks or summarizing a
discussion. The quality of this support depends on a model that understands the
conversational dialogue. To evaluate this understanding, we introduce a
dual-axis testing framework for diagnosing the AI agent's comprehension of
spoken conversations about data. Using this framework, we designed a series of
tests to evaluate understanding of a novel corpus of 72 spoken conversational
dialogues about data visualizations. We examine diverse pipelines and model
architectures, LLM vs VLM, and diverse input formats for visualizations (the
chart image, its underlying source code, or a hybrid of both) to see how this
affects model performance on our tests. Using our evaluation methods, we found
that text-only input modalities achieved the best performance (96%) in
understanding discussions of visualizations in online meetings.

Conclusion: 框架为风格适应提供评估工具，确定帕累托有效策略，跨数据集和模型验证，新可读性指标关联策略与系统可维护性。

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and
engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or
sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the
core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony
against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a
closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare
explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear
Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a
modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from
0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this
trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora
(DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation
across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility,"
showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring
register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that
are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides
a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that
identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets
and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system
maintainability.

Conclusion: 归因梯度有助于实现答案、声明、摘录和上下文的并发互连。

Abstract: AI question answering systems increasingly generate responses with
attributions to sources. However, the task of verifying the actual content of
these attributions is in most cases impractical. In this paper, we present
attribution gradients as a solution. Attribution gradients provide integrated,
incremental affordances for diving into an attributed passage. A user can
decompose a sentence of an answer into its claims. For each claim, the user can
view supporting and contradictory excerpts mined from sources. Those excerpts
serve as clickable conduits into the source (in our application, scientific
papers). When evidence itself contains more citations, the UI unpacks the
evidence into excerpts from the cited sources. These features of attribution
gradients facilitate concurrent interconnections among answer, claim, excerpt,
and context. In a usability study, we observed greater engagement with sources
and richer revision in a task where participants revised an attributed AI
answer with attribution gradients and a baseline.

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering is critical to realizing the promised
productivity gains of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive
tasks. Yet, many users struggle to craft prompts that yield high-quality
outputs, limiting the practical benefits of LLMs. Existing approaches, such as
prompt handbooks or automated optimization pipelines, either require
substantial effort, expert knowledge, or lack interactive guidance. To address
this gap, we design and evaluate PromptPilot, an interactive prompting
assistant grounded in four empirically derived design objectives for
LLM-enhanced prompt engineering. We conducted a randomized controlled
experiment with 80 participants completing three realistic, work-related
writing tasks. Participants supported by PromptPilot achieved significantly
higher performance (median: 78.3 vs. 61.7; p = .045, d = 0.56), and reported
enhanced efficiency, ease-of-use, and autonomy during interaction. These
findings empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed design
objectives, establishing LLM-enhanced prompt engineering as a viable technique
for improving human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI has sparked privacy concerns related to training
data, model interfaces, downstream applications, and more. We interviewed 25 AI
developers based in Europe to understand which privacy threats they believe
pose the greatest risk to users, developers, and businesses and what protective
strategies, if any, would help to mitigate them. We find that there is little
consensus among AI developers on the relative ranking of privacy risks. These
differences stem from salient reasoning patterns that often relate to human
rather than purely technical factors. Furthermore, while AI developers are
aware of proposed mitigation strategies for addressing these risks, they
reported minimal real-world adoption. Our findings highlight both gaps and
opportunities for empowering AI developers to better address privacy risks in

of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a
representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell
and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of
particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned
equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is
crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting
equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures,
such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic
expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain
and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale
features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure
tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training
data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be
addressed in future work.

### [446] [Directed Information $γ$-covering: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00079)
*Hai Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出Directed Information γ - covering框架用于冗余感知上下文工程，介绍其原理、算法，实验显示优于BM25。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个简单通用的冗余感知上下文工程框架。

Method: 基于有向信息（DI）提出γ - 覆盖问题，用贪心算法解决，该算法有可证明的保证，且构建γ - 覆盖与查询无关。

Result: 在HotpotQA实验中，γ - 覆盖始终优于BM25，在上下文压缩和单槽提示选择等硬决策场景有明显优势。

Conclusion: DI γ - 覆盖可作为现代大语言模型（LLM）管道的原则性、自组织骨干。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Directed Information $\gamma$-covering}, a simple but
general framework for redundancy-aware context engineering. Directed
information (DI), a causal analogue of mutual information, measures asymmetric
predictiveness between chunks. If $\operatorname{DI}_{i \to j} \ge H(C_j) -
\gamma$, then $C_i$ suffices to represent $C_j$ up to $\gamma$ bits. Building
on this criterion, we formulate context selection as a $\gamma$-cover problem
and propose a greedy algorithm with provable guarantees: it preserves query
information within bounded slack, inherits $(1+\ln n)$ and $(1-1/e)$
approximations from submodular set cover, and enforces a diversity margin.
Importantly, building the $\gamma$-cover is \emph{query-agnostic}: it incurs no
online cost and can be computed once offline and amortized across all queries.
Experiments on HotpotQA show that $\gamma$-covering consistently improves over
BM25, a competitive baseline, and provides clear advantages in hard-decision
regimes such as context compression and single-slot prompt selection. These
results establish DI $\gamma$-covering as a principled, self-organizing
backbone for modern LLM pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则采样多变量时间序列，尤其是数据稀缺情况下的异常检测难题。

Method: 引入基于NJODEs的异常检测框架，以全路径依赖方式推断条件均值和方差轨迹并计算异常分数。

Result: 在合成数据上准确识别多样偏差；应用于婴儿肠道微生物组轨迹，描绘抗生素干扰情况；异常分数能准确预测抗生素事件且优于基于多样性的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能适应不均匀间隔的纵向观测，调整协变量，为推断微生物异常提供基础，可优化干预方案。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is
challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly
detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural
jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional
mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes
anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise
anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to
infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence
of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second
antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the
second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the
inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and
outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly
spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates,
and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by
perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention
regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.

TL;DR: 提出无声码器音频超分辨率框架，用流匹配生成模型，直接重建波形，实验表现佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散的两阶段方法依赖声码器，最终音频质量受声码器性能限制，需改进。

Method: 采用流匹配生成模型捕获复值频谱系数的条件分布，通过逆短时傅里叶变换（iSTFT）直接重建波形。

Result: 模型在不同上采样因子下持续生成高保真48kHz音频，在语音和通用音频数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 无声码器框架简化了端到端优化，克服了两阶段管道的瓶颈，性能出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution
that employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional
distribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional
two-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then
rely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method
directly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform
(iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design
not only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical
bottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is
fundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our
model consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse
upsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and
general audio datasets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出ReLumix框架，将重光照算法与时间合成解耦，能让任意图像重光照技术用于视频，有两阶段流程，还引入相关机制保证效果，对真实视频泛化能力强且视觉保真度提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频后期制作中控制光照的方法缺乏灵活性，限制用户使用某些重光照模型。

Method: 提出ReLumix框架，将视频重光照分为两阶段，一是用任意图像重光照技术处理单帧参考帧，二是用微调的稳定视频扩散模型传播光照；引入门控交叉注意力机制和时间引导策略。

Result: 尽管在合成数据上训练，ReLumix对真实世界视频有较好的泛化能力，视觉保真度有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLumix为动态光照控制提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet
elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack
flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper
introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm
from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be
seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a
simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single
reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion
Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.

*Mark Boss,Andreas Engelhardt,Simon Donné,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出Reservoir SWD (ReSWD) 改进Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD)，实验显示其优于标准SWD和其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein距离计算高维分布成本高，SWD蒙特卡罗估计方差大、梯度噪声大且收敛慢。

Method: 将加权水库采样集成到SWD中，在优化步骤中自适应保留信息投影方向。

Result: 在合成基准和实际任务（如颜色校正和扩散引导）中，ReSWD始终优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线。

Conclusion: ReSWD能稳定梯度且无偏，是一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD
(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively
retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in
stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks
and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that
ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction
baselines. Project page: https://reservoirswd.github.io/

Motivation: 设计一个低延迟、面向大众的用于虚拟现实社交互动的音频驱动实时3D面部化身动画系统。

Method: 使用编码器将音频信号实时转换为潜在面部表情序列，再解码为3D面部化身；采用在线变压器和蒸馏管道减少延迟；解决实时场景关键设计挑战；框架适用于多模态应用。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统能有效实现音频驱动的实时3D面部化身动画，具有低延迟、高精度和高速度的特点，且适用于多模态应用。

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D
facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in
virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that
transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,
which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.
