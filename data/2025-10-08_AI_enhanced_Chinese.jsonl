This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing\n(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked\nactivity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous\nstimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a\nsubset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural\nresponses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature\nspace. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification\nusing a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the\nbiological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural\nactivity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the\nperformance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a\nstandard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate\nthat the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,\nhighlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational\nsubstrate.

Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,\nand control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.\nThe Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative\narchitecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is\ndedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is\nguided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop.

Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.\nTask success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.\nGoal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are\nreused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are\nreduced.

While Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs)\ncapabilities have continued to scale economically, memory bandwidth has not,\ncreating a significant price-performance disconnect. This paper argues that the\nprevailing time-based pricing models for cloud GPUs are economically\ninefficient for bandwidth-bound workloads. These models fail to account for the\nrising marginal cost of memory bandwidth, leading to market distortions and\nsuboptimal hardware allocation. To address this, we propose a novel\nfeature-based pricing framework that directly links cost to resource\nconsumption, including but not limited to memory bandwidth. We provide a robust\neconomic and algorithmic definition of this framework and introduce Agora, a\npractical and secure system architecture for its implementation. Our\nimplementation of Agora shows that a 50us sampling provides nearly perfect\npricing as what ideal sampling would provide - losing only 5\\% of revenue. 10us\nsampling is even better result in 2.4\\% loss. Modern telemetry systems can\nalready provide this rate of measurement, and our prototype implementation\nshows the system design for feature-based pricing is buildable.

Over the past decade,\nproximity graph (PG)-based indexes have demonstrated superior empirical\nperformance over alternatives. However, these methods often lack theoretical\nguarantees regarding the quality of query results, especially in the worst-case\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce the {\\alpha}-convergent graph\n({\\alpha}-CG), a new PG structure that employs a carefully designed edge\npruning rule. This rule eliminates candidate neighbors for each data point p by\napplying the shifted-scaled triangle inequalities among p, its existing\nout-neighbors, and new candidates. If the distance between the query point q\nand its exact nearest neighbor v* is at most {\\tau} for some constant {\\tau} >\n0, our {\\alpha}-CG finds the exact nearest neighbor in poly-logarithmic time,\nassuming bounded intrinsic dimensionality for the dataset; otherwise, it can\nfind an ANN in the same time. To enhance scalability, we develop the\n{\\alpha}-convergent neighborhood graph ({\\alpha}-CNG), a practical variant that\napplies the pruning rule locally within each point's neighbors. We also\nintroduce optimizations to reduce the index construction time. Experimental\nresults show that our {\\alpha}-CNG outperforms existing PGs on real-world\ndatasets.

The goal is to compute\nan envy-free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's room and\nrent to their own.

Using a quantitative\nresearch design, data were collected through a survey of 100 project\nprofessionals representing multiple industries, and analyzed with statistical\ntechniques, including Spearman correlation, to explore the relationship between\nleadership behaviors and project performance. The results show that leadership\nstyle significantly affects project outcomes, with constructive feedback, clear\ncommunication of goals, role clarity, and encouragement of team initiative\nemerging as the most impactful behaviors. These factors strongly correlate with\nproject success indicators such as goal achievement, budget adherence, and\nstakeholder satisfaction. The findings also highlight areas needing\nimprovement, including time management, conflict resolution, and involving team\nmembers in decision-making. Moreover, the study provides empirical evidence\nthat leadership styles directly shape team dynamics, motivation, and\ncollaboration, which in turn influence overall efficiency.

We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in\npractice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to\ntrain modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First,\nwe identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of\nthe diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature.\nBased on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public\ndatasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into\ndiversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European\nlaw and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the\ndata they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7eb3\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u8d21\u732e\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u653f\u7b56\u52a9\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7eb3\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u5907\u591a\u6837\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u786e\u5b9a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u653f\u7b56\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u5305\u542b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u6d32\u6cd5\u5f8b\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

We model a\nsymbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of\ninformation compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove\nthat a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible \"worlds\" (data\nstrings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,\nwe show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a\nspecific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible\nworld relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the \"grounding\nact\" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires\nthe input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from\nthe system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to\nprove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that\ncannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.\nThis establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually\nattempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff08SGP\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u610f\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u53d7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5206\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u610f\u4e49\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u65ad\u514b\u670d\u81ea\u8eab\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u4e14\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u54e5\u5fb7\u5c14\uff08\u81ea\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u514d\u8d39\u5348\u9910\uff08\u7edf\u8ba1\uff09\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u7075\u673a\uff0c\u628a\u57fa\u7840\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7eaf\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff1b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u201c\u57fa\u7840\u884c\u4e3a\u201d\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u4e49\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u65ad\u514b\u670d\u81ea\u8eab\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart\ncontract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and\nfairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and\nuniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism\ndesign, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable\nconvergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate\nperformance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept\nreal-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee\nvolatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case\nstudy illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in\nrealistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed\nmechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while\nremaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond\nsteady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy\nrelevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource\nallocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable\ncoordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with\nempirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only\nas technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency,\naccountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5408\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5408\u7ea6\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4ef7\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u7a81\u53d1\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b57\u5408\u7ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

To achieve\nthis and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,\nefficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine\nShapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two\nnovel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to\ninterpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of\nhigher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of\nthe null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements\nand flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with\nvanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The\nlatter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of\nhierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply\na unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical\nproperties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the\nprojection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion\nalgebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain\npreviously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new\nperspective.

This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional\nsemantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and\nsource. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,\ninteroperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable\nfor dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is\nthen processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic\nannotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,\nincluding the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are\nproposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the\ninteroperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the\nsynonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the\ntransportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or\ncloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,\nBluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is\nproposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,\nDempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks.

Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear\nsystem to $DA\\vec{y} = D\\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling\nmatrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\\vec{z} = \\vec{b}$.\n  As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling\nscheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial\nsystems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an\nend-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems.

These keywords are drawn from a high-quality\ndictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our\napproach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our\nexperiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two\ncommon failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited\none-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning\nwith Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing\nprior reasoning-based designs.

However, despite recent\nprogress in reducing memory consumption through activation offloading, existing\napproaches remain largely heuristic and coarse-grained, often overlooking the\nfine-grained trade-offs between memory, computation, and scheduling latency. In\nthis work, we revisit the pipeline scheduling problem from a principled\noptimization perspective. We observe that prevailing strategies either rely on\nstatic rules or aggressively offload activations without fully leveraging the\ninteraction between memory constraints and scheduling efficiency. To address\nthis, we formulate scheduling as a constrained optimization problem that\njointly accounts for memory capacity, activation reuse, and pipeline bubble\nminimization. Solving this model yields fine-grained schedules that reduce\npipeline bubbles while adhering to strict memory budgets.

Our first contribution is a\npair of time-query hierarchy theorems for property testing.

KV quantization is a key\nlever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV\ndistribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior\nwork focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten\nthe overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.\nIn this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that\nevolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic\nregularities.

Our code\nimplements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an\norder of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta\nmethods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations\nas well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In\norder to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units\nand accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in\nconjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on\nvarious GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code.\nEighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing\ntime than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller\nimpact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to\ngenerally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs.\nThe many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed\nup to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size\nsimulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over\nCPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\\approx\n3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical\nsimulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large\ngrid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency\nthat the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use\nit efficiently.

A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical\ncase, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability\ndistributions $p_1, \\dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \\{1, 2, \\dots, d\\}$, and one wishes\nto accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a\nknown hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c =\n2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \\gg \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2} +\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from\n$d_{\\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\\mathrm{avg}},q) > \\epsilon$. This nearly matches the\noptimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \\gg\n\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and\ngeneralizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we\nstudy the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum\nstates. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional\nhypothesis state $\\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state\n$\\rho_1, \\dots, \\rho_T$, one can distinguish $\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\sigma$\nfrom $D_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{avg}},\\sigma) > \\epsilon$ provided $T \\gg\nd/\\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent\ndistance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is\nsurprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the\nclassical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the\nnon-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states.

Existing multi-turn\nbenchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or\nlimiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect\nproduction-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a\nbenchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction\nenvironment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata\nfiles, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit\nclarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human\nsupervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined\nconversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting\n(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator\nor explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD\nspectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by\nexecutable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks\nrequiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600\ntasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and\nBIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed\nbehavioral analysis and rapid method development.

However, critical evidence highlights challenges with\nfully remote arrangements, particularly for software teams. This study\ninvestigates employee resignation patterns at Ericsson, a global developer of\nsoftware-intensive systems, before, during, and after the pandemic. Using HR\ndata from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work\nmodalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our\nfindings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer\n2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees\nonboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign\nwithin their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit\nsurveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary\norganizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention. By\ncontrast, the company's eventual successful return to pre-pandemic retention\nrates illustrates the value of differentiated work policies and supports\nreconsidering selective return-to-office (RTO) mandates.

The prediction of aneurysm\nrupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history.\nHowever, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of\naneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to\nreconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters.\nThe prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm\ngrowth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient\naneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact\nrepresentation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned\nfrom patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time\nseries via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output\nlayer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the\ntime series.\n  Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism\nof aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior\nphysics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization\nproblem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and\ndifferential constraints. Our results show that including physical model\ninformation about the data will not significantly improve the time series\nreconstruction results if the training data is error-free.

We outline explanation types that an LLM-generated\nassistant could provide (descriptive, contextual, and actionable explanations).\nWe also outline our next steps to assess usefulness through a task-based study\nwith OSS contributors, comparing metric-only baselines to LLM-generated\nexplanations on decision quality, time-to-completion, and error rates", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u80fd\u5426\u5c06\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6613\u8bfb\u98ce\u9669\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a9OSS\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "motivation": "OSS\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u6307\u6807\u96be\u88ab\u65b0\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u5c06\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6e05\u6670\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6682\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6682\u672a\u5f97\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, computing the exact constant\nis NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve\nsolving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with\nnetwork size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local\ninformation on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We\naddress this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields\ntight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.\nSpecifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly\nflexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing\nLipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary\nchoices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this\ngeneralized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational\ncomplexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also\ndevelop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through\nclosed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied\nby theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a\nseries of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate\nlocal information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms\nachieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing\nsignificantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches.

Our experiments demonstrate\nthat less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages\nexhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is\nproportionate to the competence of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9093\u5b81 - \u514b\u9c81\u683c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5851\u9020\u5171\u540c\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9093\u5b81 - \u514b\u9c81\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u6709\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9093\u5b81 - \u514b\u9c81\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9093\u5b81 - \u514b\u9c81\u683c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002"}}

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong\nITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when\nguided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early\nin the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward.

However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality.

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this\noverhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance\ngap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale\nmismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,\ndecays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to\nnoise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of\noptimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the\ngradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we\nprovide the first convergence guarantees.

Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded\ncompetitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive\n(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:\nAUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets\n(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79\n[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling\nstrategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from\nradiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with\nhigh accuracy.

We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new\nevaluation framework that addresses these limitations.

Our major results are as\nfollows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than\nautoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative\napproaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform\nproton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or\nreverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances\nthe performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray\nchannel.

Recent works have\nproposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for\nmanual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving\nsimilar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require\ncomputationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task\ndomain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled\nvalidation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)\nreasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting\nthat the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further\ninvestigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design\nthat pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic\nReasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular\nreasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is\ndiscovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple\nCoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution\ntraces.

To address\nthese challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which\neffectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on\nlow-resource devices.\n  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce\nAdaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that\nprogressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8\nbits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively\nallocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise\nimportance using bit regularization.\n  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,\ndelivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better\nclassification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,\nit significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit\nrepresentation collapse during the training.\n  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical\nmulti-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference\naccuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during\ntraining.

E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.\nWilliams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through\ntruncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes\nRendus Math\\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of\nFluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work\nintroduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation\nparadigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order\noptimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this\nmethod yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of\nthe infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an\nexploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.\n  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,\nInfinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed\nexpressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a\nsimple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.\nTogether, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables\nexact, non-iterative convergence.

While both approaches\nhave shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their\ngeneralizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we\nimplement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic\ndecision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a\nnon-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot\nprompting framework, as proposed in recent literature.

While this is a computationally efficient\nstrategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a\nnoticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression\nvia Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework\nthat replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse\nfactorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense\ndictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a\nunion-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight\nmatrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected\ndictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant\nbasis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the\nfactorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers\nclosely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional\nreconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware\nstrategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under\nreasonable compression ratios.

Insurance fraud is a\nprime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals\nthat stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple\npolicies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find\nmeaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance\npresent in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and\ndynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.\nThat is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the\nfield. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine\n(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs.

However, these approaches are\nfundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail\nto provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most\ncritically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical\ndeployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:\ntop-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,\nwhereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are\nrelatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical\nguarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse\nattention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on\napproximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a\ncompelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at\nscale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both\nindividually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our\nexperiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse\nattention (e.g., $\\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and\nDeepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap\nbetween full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model\nquality with upto 20x sparsity).

Many observations\nhave already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far\nis required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey\npaper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the\nexisting works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic\ndescription, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,\nand the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present\nthe findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.\nAmong the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated\ntext is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by\nthe increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower\nreliance on adjectives and adverbs.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies.

In fact, one can manipulate model\nrankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character\nseparating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,\nand doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that\ngood-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.\nFinally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of\ndelimiter.

However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous\ndata sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches\ntypically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting\nthe inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to\ninformation loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a\nnovel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates\nGPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE\naccuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction\nmodule to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,\nwhile a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information\ndensity for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining\nobjectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further\nstrengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong\ngeneralization abilities.

We formalize and validate three realistic threat models\ntargeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of\nfine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;\n2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into\nwebpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply\nchain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data\nto improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few\nas 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an\nagent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a\nspecific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat\nmodels.

While traditional\nmesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive\nand require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties.

In this work, we address these\nchallenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling\nfast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we\npropose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding\ngraph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error\naccumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator\narchitecture.

SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model\nwith a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration\nenables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign\nprompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain\nattacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack\nsuccess rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\\% across various attack\nscenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images\nfor unsafe prompts, \\textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images,\nenhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the\nSD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as\nthe Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different\narchitectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical\ndeployment of secure text-to-image systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSafeGuider\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Stable Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0[EOS]\u6807\u8bb0\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SafeGuider\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea7\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u64e6\u9664\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SafeGuider\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec55.48%\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeGuider\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u501f\u9274\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Based on this\nquantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two\ndifferent properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node\nembeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight\nmatrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show\nthat oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the\nnumber of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise\nbounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,\nadjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we\nintroduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification\naccuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths.

External LLM-based\nguardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and\noutputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are\nvulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval\nAugmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust\nLLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the\ncontext. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss\nmodels, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context\nalters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of\ncases, making them unreliable.

We\nintroduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel\nauto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features\nthrough a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed\nnetwork automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using\nthe extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for\noptimal image outcomes.

While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost\nwithout sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused\non the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model\nfaithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like\nhealthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain\nfaithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a\nnovel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond\nstandard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics\nthat capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions\ninclude introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the\noriginal and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared\ntests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across\nboth the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts\nthat aggregate fairness metrics may obscure.

However, realizing this\nvision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as\nwell as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on\nresource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,\nonline latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures\nfine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,\ndecode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We\nimplement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high\nprofiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput\nreduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave\ngovernor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies\nrevealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,\nquantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic\noptimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the\nruntime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for\ninformed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM\nsystems.

While HP\nguarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is\nunderstood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in\ndecentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded\ngradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap\nbetween assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the\nmean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic\nGradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized\nsettings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same\nconditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.\nMotivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in\nthe presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in\nHP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing\nuniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while\nsimultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly\nconvex costs.

Accordingly, recent\nefforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if\nretrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a\nlong input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are\nreplaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when\nthey are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant\ntokens.

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies.

However, deploying LLMs at scale\nfor domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job\nseeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person\nfit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job\nrequirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.\nDirectly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to\nyield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and\nthe need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads\nto high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for\nonline use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM\nknowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit\ntasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for\nclassification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better\ndistill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple\ndownstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that\nintegrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the\nknowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training\ntechniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully\nadapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics\nfor both job person fit and explanation.

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities\nfrom their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student\nillustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human\ndescription of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels.

To\nenhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image\nsynthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a\nphenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs\nand can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we\nexplore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image\ngeneration. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that\nencourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI\nrewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to\nan estimated difficulty for each task.

Next, as our main contribution, we present a\ndistributed matching lemma for ERS, which serves as the rejection sampling\ncounterpart to the Poisson Matching Lemma (PML) introduced by Li and Anantharam\n(2021). Our result also generalizes a recent work on importance matching lemma\n(Phan et al, 2024) and, to our knowledge, is the first result on distributed\nmatching in the family of rejection sampling schemes where the matching\nprobability is close to PML. We demonstrate the practical significance of our\napproach over prior works by applying it to distributed compression. The\neffectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated through experiments involving\nsynthetic Gaussian sources and distributed image compression using the MNIST\ndataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff08ERS\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff08ERS\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eERS\u7684\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faERS\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u7406\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing\nraw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full\ncomplexity of the original encoder.\n  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses\nthese challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw\nimagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to\nderive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as\ninteractive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from\nthree published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of\n-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for\ndesert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than\nstandard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal\naccuracy loss.\n  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger\ncrop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp\nimprovement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress\nfrom raw data to model deployment within a single working day.\n  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo\ntransforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,\nlarge-scale Earth observation.

Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can\neliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole\n(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do\nnot provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a\nself-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis\n(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable\nregistration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion\ndescriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction\nand relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are\ndetermined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated\nfor both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2\n(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC\n(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to\npatients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German\nCompetence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved\nimproved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED\nand ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the\nvolume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional\nkeyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for\nSAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and\nintra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase\nlengths.

Building on this insight, we propose Context\nDenoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy\nthat improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on\nmodel predictions.

To evaluate our method, we\nconstruct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream\nvisual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and\nstrong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to\nreal-world perturbations.

However,\nfor end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames\nresults in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as\nvideo length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods\nimprove the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical\nchallenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in\nlong videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex\nhierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address\nthese issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and\nclusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed\nVideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving\ntemporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely\nlocate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy\noptimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of\nthe VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree\nstructures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while\nbeing guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve\nsuperior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several\ninteresting insights.

We explain this drift through a\nBayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual\nevidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models\nto storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning.

These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models.

Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance\ndownstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,\nplus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports\ncoherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u533b\u5b66\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bMeDiM\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u80fd\u8de8\u5168\u8c31\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMeDiM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u9664\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5d4c\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728MIMIC - CXR\u548cPathGen\u4e0a\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u533b\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf - \u62a5\u544a\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MeDiM\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often repetitively remask\ntokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations\nand limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding\ntraces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a\ntoken several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical\ninformation and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace\nCredit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating\nhistorical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free\nparallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of\ncorrect but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.\nThis process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding\nrobustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup\nand a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times\nspeedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.\nImportantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is\northogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily\nintegrable and versatile solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTrace Credit\u6982\u5ff5\u548cCreditDecoding\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u521d\u59cb\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u91cd\u590d\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Trace Credit\u6982\u5ff5\u91cf\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u6536\u655b\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5CreditDecoding\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u548cTrace Credit\u52a0\u901f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cCreditDecoding\u8f83LLaDA - 8B - Instruct\u5b9e\u73b05.48\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c0.48\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8f83LLaDA - MoE - Instruct\u5b9e\u73b04.11\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c0.15\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CreditDecoding\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7801\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u662f\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce StarEmbed,\nthe first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves'').\nWe benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised\nclustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source\ndetection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with\nmulti-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k\nhand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We\nevaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI,\nChronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against\nhandcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics\nliterature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos\nmodels, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical\nobservations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in\nsome tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular,\nTSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source\ndetection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time\nseries data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm\nshift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised\npipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the\nanalysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165StarEmbed\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30TSFMs\u5728\u6052\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aTSFMs\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u65f6\u57df\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TSFMs\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u5929\u6587\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u5929\u6587\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9TSFMs\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165StarEmbed\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cdTSFMs\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "TSFMs\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fChronos\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u65e2\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86TSFMs\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u65f6\u57df\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4ece\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u9053\u5411\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains.
