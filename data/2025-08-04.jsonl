In the literature, we\nhave the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural\ncharacterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by\nmaximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are\nspecifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of\nthe popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the\nsame manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the\npopular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct\nconnection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three\nproblems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from\nthe other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular\nmatchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of\nthe two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the\ngraph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the\nmaximum-weight matching problem."}

Typically, proportionality is captured\nby variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive\ngroups of at least $\\ell\\cdot\\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number\nof voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\\ell$\nrepresentatives. The quantity $\\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the\nsocial choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the\nDroop quota, defined as $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{k+1}\\rfloor+1$. This quota is often\nused in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single\nTransferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's\nProportionality Criterion.

The\ncontribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting\nrules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare\nquota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR,\nPJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of\nthis axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the\ncorresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it\nis necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult\nto satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the\nfrontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms.

Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices.

We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by\nLLMs only achieve 41.32\\%, 45.10\\%, 30.22\\%, and 40.21\\% for accuracy,\nstatement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all\nLLMs, respectively.

Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it\nis crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics\nof user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct\nan empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world\nservices in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users\nprovide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback\nitems can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether\nadopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable.\nResults: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides\nirrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to\nfilter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback.\nMoreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on\nuser feedback characteristics. Finally, we find that the distributions of the\nfeedback topics in different time intervals are similar. This confirms that\ndesigning machine learning-based approaches is a viable direction for better\nanalyzing user feedback. Conclusions: We consider that our findings can serve\nas an empirical foundation for feedback-based issue detection in large-scale\nservice systems, which sheds light on the design and implementation of\npractical issue detection approaches."}

Existing\ninterpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often\nrequire or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant\nlimitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like\nbackdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.\n  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and\ncontrolling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,\nthereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the\nunknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the\nweight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to\nnewly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations\nalong these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during\nfine-tuning with high precision.\n  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger\nis present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate\nbelow 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on\nerased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to\nrecover \"unlearned\" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows\npotential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial\ninstruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover\nmodel-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney\nprompt generation.\n  Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch."}

ToM - the ability to understand that\nothers can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about\nothers' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active\ninference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on\ntask-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,\nwhile being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains\ndistinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend\nthe sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically\nexplore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is\nevaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results\ndemonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM\ncounterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.\nCrucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from\nobservable behaviour.

We compare the diagram with atomic\nrequirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified\narchitecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several\nmechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced\ndiffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised\nnode classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and\ndemonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via\nend-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine\nhomophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified\nconfidence intervals on unseen nodes."}

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,\nDP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised\nadaptation in target domains.

To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy."}

Specifically, we first explore the amplified security\nrisks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we\nintroduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in\naddressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for\nsecure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization\nframework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced\nstate features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic\nrewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for\nsecure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline\nfuture directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications."}

The security constraint requires\nthat no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up\nto $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies\nthe minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the\nfundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of\nprovably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning\nsystems."}
