We propose an efficient policy for determining, every day, the promotion that each customer should receive (10%, 12%, 15%, 17%, or 20% off), while respecting global allocation constraints. This policy was successfully deployed to see a 4.5% revenue increase during an A/B test, by better targeting promotion-sensitive customers and also learning intertemporal patterns across customers.\n  We also consider theoretically modeling the intertemporal state of the customer. The data suggests a simple new combinatorial model of pricing with reference effects, where the customer remembers the best promotion they saw over the past $\\ell$ days as the \"reference value\", and is more likely to purchase if this value is poor.

While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6811\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u6709\u62df\u9635\u79e9\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u6548\u7528\u4e3a\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u548c\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7684General Yankee Swap\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Such a service would be useful for analysing the progress of deliberation and steering discussion towards issues that still require further debate. Guided by this use case, we explore possibilities for providing a clear definition of what it means to select a set of most divisive proposals on the basis of people's stated preferences over proposals.

The 10 weather station locations in Oman and their corresponding governorates are Seeb (in Muscat), Salalah (in Dhofar), Buraimi (in Al Buraimi), Masirah (in Ash Sharqiyah South), Thumrait (in Dhofar), Sur (in Ash Sharqiyah South), Khasab (in Musandam), Sohar (in Sohar), Fahud (in Az Zahirah), and Saiq (in Ad Dakhiliyah). The obtained wind speed distributions at these weather stations are then used to predict the annual energy production (AEP) for a proposed reference amount of 1 MWp of wind turbine capacity, and this specific AEP is designated here by the term \"normalized annual energy production (NAEP).\" The direction of the wind is also analyzed statistically over the same period to identify the more probable wind directions. Four locations were clearly distinguishable as being windy compared to the others. The simulated probability of exceeding a feasible 6 m/s (21.6 km/h) wind speed in these locations is 41.71% in Thumrait, 37.77% in Masirah, 29.53% in Sur, and 17.03% in Fahud. The NAEP values in these four locations are estimated as 1.727 GWh/MWp/year, 1.419 GWh/MWp/year, 1.038 GWh/MWp/year, and 0.602 GWh/MWp/year, respectively. The wind in the location of Thumrait is not only the fastest (on average) among the selected locations but also the most unidirectional, blowing almost always from the south-south-east (SSE) direction, and both features make this non-coastal location in southern Oman, with an altitude of about 467 m, an attractive site for utility-scale wind farms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u67902000 - 2023\u5e74\u963f\u66fc10\u4e2a\u6c14\u8c61\u7ad9\u98ce\u901f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5a01\u5e03\u5c14\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5e74\u53d1\u7535\u91cf\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u5411\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a4\u4e2a\u591a\u98ce\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u56fe\u59c6\u8d56\u7279\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5efa\u8bbe\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u66fc\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u98ce\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u9009\u5740\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6c14\u8c61\u7ad9\u98ce\u901f\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5a01\u5e03\u5c14\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5e74\u53d1\u7535\u91cf\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a4\u4e2a\u591a\u98ce\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8d856m/s\u98ce\u901f\u6982\u7387\u53ca\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5e74\u53d1\u7535\u91cf\uff0c\u56fe\u59c6\u8d56\u7279\u98ce\u51b5\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u59c6\u8d56\u7279\u51ed\u501f\u98ce\u901f\u548c\u98ce\u5411\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u662f\u5efa\u8bbe\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5730\u70b9\u3002"}}

Hojabr integrates relational algebra, tensor algebra, and constraint-based reasoning within a single higher-order algebraic framework, in which joins, aggregations, tensor contractions, and recursive computations are expressed uniformly. Physical choices, such as join algorithms, execution models, and sparse versus dense tensor representations, are handled as constraint-specialization decisions rather than as separate formalisms. Hojabr supports bidirectional translation with existing declarative languages, enabling programs to be both lowered into Hojabr for analysis and optimization and lifted back into their original declarative form.

Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance.

Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability.

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u591a\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668Unifico\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Popcorn\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f16\u8bd1\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1Unifico\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLVM\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u76f8\u540c\u6808\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u7edf\u4e00ABI\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u4e3ax86 - 64\u548cARMv8 ISAs\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bNAS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5e73\u5747\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u52306%\uff0810%\uff09\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Popcorn\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5927\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "Unifico\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels (\u03c3 = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u773c\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u52a8\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u9608\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6613\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8272\u6563\u9608\u503c\u66f4\u6297\u566a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u773c\u8df3\u548c\u6ce8\u89c6\u533a\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u773c\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u773c\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u52a8\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u773c\u8df3\u548c\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u6700\u4f18\u9608\u503c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901f\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0890 - 93%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8272\u6563\u9608\u503c\u6297\u566a\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ecd\u8d8581%\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u7387 - \u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b80\u7ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Following the 2008 financial crisis, accounting standards were updated to require repo intermediaries, who are mostly banks, to increase recorded assets at the time of the first transaction. Concurrently, US bank regulators implemented a supplementary leverage ratio constraint that reduces the volume of assets a bank is allowed record. The interaction of the new accounting rules and bank regulations limits the volume of repo trades that banks can intermediate. To reduce the balance-sheet impact of repo, the SEC has mandated banks to centrally clear all Treasuries trades.

We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).\n  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.\n  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u5148\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u666e\u5c14500\u884c\u4e1a\u6307\u6570\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u6295\u8d44\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5e02\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u884c\u4e1a\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u6ce2\u52a8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u91cf\u5316\u91d1\u878d\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e02\u573a\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd - \u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts.

We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments.

While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines.

We address three fundamental problems in customer risk analytics: data silos preventing holistic relationship assessment, extreme behavioral class imbalance, and suboptimal customer intervention strategies that fail to balance compliance costs with relationship value. We develop an integrated customer intelligence framework combining federated learning, relational network analysis, and adaptive targeting policies. Our federated graph neural network enables collaborative behavior modeling across competing institutions without compromising proprietary customer data, using privacy-preserving embeddings to capture cross-market relational patterns. We introduce cross-bank Personalized PageRank to identify coordinated behavioral clusters providing interpretable customer network segmentation for risk managers. A hierarchical reinforcement learning mechanism optimizes dynamic intervention targeting, calibrating escalation policies to maximize prevention value while minimizing customer friction and operational costs. Analyzing 1.4 million customer transactions across seven markets, our approach reduces false positive and false negative rates to 4.64% and 11.07%, substantially outperforming single-institution models. The framework prevents 79.25% of potential losses versus 49.41% under fixed-rule policies, with optimal market-specific targeting thresholds reflecting heterogeneous customer base characteristics.

Recently, an interactive query has been studied extensively in the database literature with the advantage of both the top-k query (with limited output size) and the skyline query (which does not require users to explicitly specify their preference function). This approach iteratively asks the user to select the one preferred within a set of options. Based on rounds of feedback, the query learns the implicit preference and returns the most favorable as a recommendation.\n  However, many modern applications in areas like housing or financial product markets feature datasets with hundreds of attributes. Existing interactive algorithms either fail to scale or require excessive user interactions (often exceeding 1000 rounds). Motivated by this, we propose FHDR (Fast High-Dimensional Reduction), a novel framework that takes less than 0.01s with fewer than 30 rounds of interaction. It is considered a breakthrough in the field of interactive queries since most, if not all, existing studies are not scalable to high-dimensional datasets.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that FHDR outperforms the best-known algorithms by at least an order of magnitude in execution time and up to several orders of magnitude in terms of the number of interactions required, establishing a new state of the art for scalable interactive regret minimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6FHDR\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u542b\u6570\u767e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u6216\u9700\u8fc7\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6FHDR\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aFHDR\u5728\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u81f3\u5c11\u6bd4\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f73\u7b97\u6cd5\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u9700\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b21\u6570\u4e0a\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "FHDR\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u540e\u6094\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u6746\u3002"}}

However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.\n  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\\star\\left(14^t\\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\\star\\left((4e)^t\\right)\\approx O^\\star\\left(10.88^t\\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph.

Accepted by WSDM'26", "summary": "Incorporating item-side information, such as category and brand, into sequential recommendation is a well-established and effective approach for improving performance. However, despite significant advancements, current models are generally limited by three key challenges: they often overlook the fine-grained temporal dynamics inherent in timestamps, exhibit vulnerability to noise in user interaction sequences, and rely on computationally expensive fusion architectures. To systematically address these challenges, we propose the Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion (TASIF) framework. TASIF integrates three synergistic components: (1) a simple, plug-and-play time span partitioning mechanism to capture global temporal patterns; (2) an adaptive frequency filter that leverages a learnable gate to denoise feature sequences adaptively, thereby providing higher-quality inputs for subsequent fusion modules; and (3) an efficient adaptive side information fusion layer, this layer employs a \"guide-not-mix\" architecture, where attributes guide the attention mechanism without being mixed into the content-representing item embeddings, ensuring deep interaction while ensuring computational efficiency.

This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that CRMS reduces latency by over 14\\% and improves energy efficiency compared with heuristic and search-based baselines, offering a practical and scalable solution for heterogeneous edge environments with dynamic workload characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u591a\u5f02\u6784\u5e94\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u548c\u8282\u80fd\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u6392\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f97\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u62df\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u51f8\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bb9\u5668\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u8d8514%\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) typically ignore these couplings and treat all constraints as a single aggregate, which lacks interpretability regarding the specific geometric roles of constraints. To address this limitation, we first analyze how different constraints interact and show that the final Constrained Pareto Front (CPF) depends not only on the Pareto fronts of individual constraints but also on the boundaries of infeasible regions. This insight implies that CMOPs with different coupling types must be solved from different search directions. Accordingly, we propose a novel algorithm named Decoupling Constraint from Two Directions (DCF2D). This method periodically detects constraint couplings and spawns an auxiliary population for each relevant constraint with an appropriate search direction.

This paper examines how the treatment of global inequality, captured by regional welfare weights, affects optimal carbon prices. I develop theory to identify the conditions under which accounting for differences in marginal utilities of consumption across countries leads to more stringent global climate policy in the absence of international transfers. I further establish a connection between the optimal uniform carbon prices implied by different welfare weights and heterogeneous regional preferences over climate policy stringency. In calibrated simulations, I find that accounting for global inequality reduces optimal global emissions relative to an inequality-insensitive benchmark.

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects.

In NMF, a non-negative matrix is decomposed into the product of two non-negative matrices, and the approximation accuracy is evaluated by a loss function. If the Kullback-Leibler divergence is chosen as the loss function, the estimation coincides with maximum likelihood under the assumption that the data entries are distributed according to a Poisson distribution. To address overdispersion, negative binomial matrix factorization has recently been proposed as an extension of the Poisson-based model. However, the negative binomial distribution often generates an excessive number of zeros, which limits its expressive capacity. In this study, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization based on the generalized Poisson distribution, which can flexibly accommodate overdispersion, and we introduce a maximum likelihood approach for parameter estimation.

While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions.

Learned indexes model the indexing process as a prediction problem to overcome the inherent trade-offs of traditional indexes. However, most existing learned indexes optimize only for limited objectives like query latency or space usage, neglecting other practical evaluation dimensions such as update efficiency and stability. Moreover, many learned indexes rely on assumptions about data distributions or workloads, lacking theoretical guarantees when facing unknown or evolving scenarios, which limits their generality in real-world systems.\n  In this paper, we propose LMIndex, a robust framework for learned indexing that leverages a efficient query/update top-layer structure (theoretically $O(1)$ when the key type is fixed) and a efficient optimal error threshold training algorithm (approach $O(1)$ in practice). Building upon this, we develop LMG (LMIndex with gaps), a variant employing a novel gap allocation strategy to enhance update performance and maintain stability under dynamic workloads. Extensive evaluations show that LMG achieves competitive or leading performance, including bulk loading (up to 8.25$\\times$ faster), point queries (up to 1.49$\\times$ faster), range queries (up to 4.02$\\times$ faster than B+Tree), update (up to 1.5$\\times$ faster on read-write workloads), stability (up to 82.59$\\times$ lower coefficient of variation), and space usage (up to 1.38$\\times$ smaller).

The problem, together with its edge-based variant, is one of the most basic in graph theory and algorithms, and has been studied extensively. The fastest currently known algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) has running time $\\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. A long line of work over the past decades led to faster algorithms for other main versions of the problem, including the undirected edge-based setting (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), directed edge-based setting (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), and undirected vertex-based setting (Chuzhoy and Trabelsi, STOC 2025). However, for the vertex-based version in directed graphs, the 29 year-old $\\tilde{O}(mn)$-time algorithm of Henzinger, Rao and Gabow remains the state of the art to this day, in all edge-density regimes. In this paper we break the $\u0398(mn)$ running time barrier for the first time, by providing a randomized algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut, with running time $O\\left(mn^{0.976}\\cdot\\operatorname{polylog} W\\right)$ where $W$ is the ratio of largest to smallest vertex weight. Additionally, we provide a randomized $O\\left(\\min\\left\\{m^{1+o(1)}\\cdot k,n^{2+o(1)}\\right\\}\\right)$-time algorithm for the unweighted version of directed global minimum vertex-cut, where $k$ is the value of the optimal solution.

In this work, we propose two complementary retrieval-stage defenses: RAGPart and RAGMask. Our defenses operate directly on the retriever, making them computationally lightweight and requiring no modification to the generation model. RAGPart leverages the inherent training dynamics of dense retrievers, exploiting document partitioning to mitigate the effect of poisoned points. In contrast, RAGMask identifies suspicious tokens based on significant similarity shifts under targeted token masking. Across two benchmarks, four poisoning strategies, and four state-of-the-art retrievers, our defenses consistently reduce attack success rates while preserving utility under benign conditions.

This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSRA scheme yields higher test accuracy, reduced learning latency, and lower energy consumption compared to baseline methods that do not account for data heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa CSRA \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53d7\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53ca\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\u6280\u672f\u7684 CSRA \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a CSRA \u65b9\u6848\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0 CSRA \u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults.

Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\\mathbf\u03b8$ given observed data $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors.

In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy.

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches.

The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space.\n  When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24]. To overcome this hardness, we allow limited access to cardinal information by querying the metric space. In this setting, our main contribution is a factor-$5$ distortion algorithm that requires only $O(k \\log^2 k)$ queries. Along the way, we present an improved factor-$3$ distortion algorithm using $O(k^2)$ queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73k\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u6709\u9650\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u67095\u500d\u548c3\u500d\u5931\u771f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73k\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u57fa\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6k\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u514b\u670d\u786c\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u516c\u5e73k\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u83b7\u53d6\u6709\u9650\u57fa\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3a5\u7684\u5931\u771f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700O(k log\u00b2k)\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3a3\u7684\u5931\u771f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700O(k\u00b2)\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73k\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present \\textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture.

Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \\textbf{153.2}\\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \\textbf{179.6}\\% for the V cache.

SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement.

Despite its prevalence, there is a limited understanding of why certain consumers experience regret more frequently as a chronic aspect of their engagement in the marketplace. This study explores the antecedents of consumer regret frequency by integrating decision agency, status signaling motivations, and online shopping preferences into a cohesive framework. By analyzing survey data (n=338), we assess whether consumers' perceived agency and decision-making orientation correlate with the frequency of regret, and whether tendencies towards status-related consumption and preferences for online shopping environments exacerbate regret through mechanisms such as increased social comparison, expanded choice sets, and continuous exposure to alternative offers. The findings reveal that regret frequency is significantly linked to individual differences in decision-related orientations and status signaling, with a preference for online shopping further contributing to regret-prone consumption behaviors. These results extend the scope of regret and cognitive dissonance research beyond isolated decision episodes by emphasizing regret frequency as a persistent consumer outcome. From a managerial standpoint, the findings suggest that retailers can alleviate regret-driven dissatisfaction by enhancing decision support, minimizing choice overload, and developing post-purchase reassurance strategies tailored to segments prone to regret..", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u5730\u4f4d\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u7f51\u8d2d\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u540e\u6094\u9891\u7387\u7684\u524d\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u503e\u5411\u548c\u5730\u4f4d\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u7f51\u8d2d\u504f\u597d\u52a0\u5267\u540e\u6094\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u6094\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u540e\u6094\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u9891\u7e41\u540e\u6094\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u540e\u6094\u9891\u7387\u7684\u524d\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u5730\u4f4d\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u7f51\u8d2d\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790338\u4efd\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u540e\u6094\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u503e\u5411\u548c\u5730\u4f4d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7f51\u8d2d\u504f\u597d\u52a0\u5267\u540e\u6094\u6d88\u8d39\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u540e\u6094\u9891\u7387\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u6094\u4e0d\u6ee1\u3002"}}

This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern \"Red AI\" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural \"important features\" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.\n  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3.

In particular, generalized peaks-over-threshold approaches allow for the consideration of single extreme events. These can be flexibly defined as exceedances of a risk functional $r$, such as a spatial average, applied to $X$. Inference for the resulting limit process, the so-called $r$-Pareto process, requires the evaluation of $r(X)$ and thus the knowledge of the whole process $X$. In many practical applications, however, observations of $X$ are only available at scattered sites. To overcome this issue, we propose a two-step MCMC-algorithm in a Bayesian framework. In a first step, we sample from $X$ conditionally on the observations in order to evaluate which observations lead to $r$-exceedances. In a second step, we use these exceedances to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the limiting $r$-Pareto process. Alternating these steps results in a full Bayesian model for the extremes of $X$. We show that, under appropriate assumptions, the probability of classifying an observation as $r$-exceedance in the first step converges to the desired probability. Furthermore, given the first step, the distribution of the Markov chain constructed in the second step converges to the posterior distribution of interest.

In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$\u03b3$-Flow Matching ($\u03b3$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \\emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $\u03b3$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $\u03b3$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $\u03b3$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u03b3 - Flow Matching (\u03b3 - FM)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684Flow Matching\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Flow Matching\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u52a0\u6743L\u00b2\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u79ef\u5206\u533a\u57df\u662f\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u201c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u201d\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6df7\u4e71\u6216\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u03b3 - FM\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u7c92\u5b50\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u964d\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6d1e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cdFM\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u03b3 - FM\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u03b3 - Stein\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u7a7a\u6d1e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u632f\u8361\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03b3 - FM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743Flow Matching\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We further propose statement-level alignment metrics that combine LLM- and NLI-based approaches to assess both factual consistency and relevance of generated explanations. Across extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models, we uncover a critical gap: while models achieve high semantic similarity scores (BERTScore F1: 0.81-0.90), all our factuality metrics reveal alarmingly low performance (LLM-based statement-level precision: 4.38%-32.88%).

With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \\texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \\texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot.

In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline.

These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.\n  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking.

A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f15\u5165\u6b67\u89c6\u805a\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHyFair\u6280\u672f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6982\u5ff5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4e2a\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6216\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u6b67\u89c6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6b67\u89c6\u805a\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHyFair\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8k - \u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u8f93\u5165\u96c6\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "HyFair\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HyFair\u6280\u672f\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.\n  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c0ftransformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4fdd\u7559\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u4e14\u6cbf\u6b64\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u53ef\u63a7\u2018\u98ce\u6d1e\u2019\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c0ftransformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Pythia\u3001Phi - 2\u3001Llama - 3\u548cMistral\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9Pythia - 410M\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u8f74\u7ebf\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5bf9\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u8f74\u5e72\u9884\u5219\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5355\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u672a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u884c\u4e3a\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4f7f\u98ce\u6d1e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u6b64\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

In particular, we prove that any proper species sampling process can be written, at the prior level, as a finite mixture with a latent truncation variable and reweighted atoms, while preserving its distributional features exactly. These finite formulations can be used as drop-in replacements in Bayesian mixture models, recasting posterior computation in terms of familiar finite-mixture machinery.

The goal is to determine a job processing permutation for each day, aiming to minimize the maximum total completion time experienced by any client. This problem is known to be NP-hard for quite restrictive settings, with previous work offering exact solution methods for highly-structured special cases.\n  In this paper, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Our main contributions can be briefly summarized as follows:\n  (i) When job processing times are day-dependent, we devise a polynomial-time LP-based $2$-approximation, as well as a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a constant number of days.\n  (ii) With day-invariant processing times, we obtain a surprisingly simple $(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}+\u03b5)$-approximation in polynomial time. This setting is also shown to admit a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme for an arbitrary number of days.\n  The key technical component driving our approximation schemes is a novel batching technique, where jobs are conceptually grouped into batches, subsequently leading either to a low-dimensional dynamic program or to a compact configuration LP. Concurrently, while developing our constant-factor approximations, we propose a host of lower-bounding mechanisms that may be of broader interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces.

Unlike \"blind\" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive \"Plan-Execute-Summarize\" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process.

By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions.

We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684mCCAdL\u6052\u6e29\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u539fCCAdL\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u5e73\u65b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u6cf0\u52d2\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3cCCAdL\u989d\u5916\u9879\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3amCCAdL\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u88c2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "mCCAdL\u76f8\u6bd4\u539fCCAdL\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6d41\u884c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "mCCAdL\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph.

Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations.

However, due to the strict privacy constraints inherent in FRs, access to user-item interaction data and user profiles across clients is highly restricted, making it difficult to learn globally effective representations for new (cold-start) items. Consequently, the item cold-start problem becomes even more challenging in FRs. Existing solutions typically predict embeddings for new items through the attribute-to-embedding mapping paradigm, which establishes a fixed one-to-one correspondence between item attributes and their embeddings. However, this one-to-one mapping paradigm often fails to model varying data distributions and tends to cause embedding misalignment, as verified by our empirical studies. To this end, we propose MDiffFR, a novel generation-based modality-guided diffusion method for cold-start items in FRs. In this framework, we employ a tailored diffusion model on the server to generate embeddings for new items, which are then distributed to clients for cold-start inference. To align item semantics, we deploy a pre-trained modality encoder to extract modality features as conditional signals to guide the reverse denoising process. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed method achieves stronger privacy guarantees compared to existing mapping-based approaches. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms all baselines in FRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MDiffFR \u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u5f97\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u5cfb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u6613\u81f4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u9006\u5411\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MDiffFR \u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent \"Black-Box\" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution.

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06E - prop\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RTRL\u548cE - prop\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8111\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u591a\u5c42\uff0c\u9700\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u6269\u5c55E - prop\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u8de8\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06E - prop\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8ff9\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry.

Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy.

A Comprehensive Study in Network Clustering", "categories": ["cs.SI", "stat.CO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Selecting the number of communities is a fundamental challenge in network clustering. The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of the silhouette score across unweighted, weighted, and fully connected networks, examining how network size, separation strength, and community size imbalance influence its performance. Simulation studies show that the silhouette score accurately identifies the true number of communities when clusters are well separated and balanced, but it tends to underestimate under strong imbalance or weak separation and to overestimate in sparse networks. Extending the evaluation to a real airline reachability network, we demonstrate that the silhouette-based clustering can recover geographically interpretable and market-oriented clusters. These findings provide empirical guidance for applying the silhouette score in network clustering and clarify the conditions under which its use is most reliable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u793e\u533a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u793e\u533a\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\uff0c\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u533a\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u5f3a\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u5f31\u5206\u79bb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u5177\u6709\u5730\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u5bfc\u5411\u6027\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1).

ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6295\u5f71\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1DNN\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u521b\u9020\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u4e8eDNN\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5728\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u7269\u4f53\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6295\u5f71\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1DNN\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.\n  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent.

Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations.

The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks.

Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa HiGR \u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u9879\u76ee\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784 ID\uff1b\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5217\u8868\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5217\u8868\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "HiGR \u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8d85 10%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347 5 \u500d\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf A/B \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u89c6\u9891\u6d4f\u89c8\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u589e\u52a0 1.22%\u548c 1.73%\u3002", "conclusion": "HiGR \u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction.

This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility.

Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction.

In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses.

Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination.

Unlike conventional garbage collectors, VGC employs a dual layer architecture consisting of Active VGC and Passive VGC to enable efficient, low overhead memory management. Active VGC dynamically manages runtime objects using a concurrent mark and sweep strategy tailored for parallel workloads, reducing pause times by up to 30 percent compared to generational collectors in multithreaded benchmarks. Passive VGC operates at compile time and optimizes static object allocation through predictive memory mapping, minimizing fragmentation by aligning objects to cache boundaries. This separation of responsibilities ensures predictable memory access patterns, reduces total memory usage by up to 25 percent, and improves scalability for modern parallel applications. By integrating compile time and runtime optimizations, VGC provides a robust and adaptable solution for memory intensive systems across both low level and high level programming environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGC\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4ece\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7531Active VGC\u548cPassive VGC\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0cActive VGC\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7528\u5e76\u53d1\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u6e05\u9664\u7b56\u7565\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0cPassive VGC\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6682\u505c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u5206\u4ee3\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1130%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a25%\u7684\u603b\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u788e\u7247\u3002", "conclusion": "VGC\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7f16\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets.

To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence.

Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools.

This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.\n  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers.

While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent.

Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5RSA\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6709\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u9ad8\u5371\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRSA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7eb3\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "RSA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets.

We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification.

EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ecf\u6d4e\u62d2\u7edd\u5b89\u5168\uff08EDS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51/\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51/\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u8bf1\u9975\u9a71\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u71b5\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u5f81\u7a0e\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aStackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aEDS\u80fd\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u51cf\u901f32 - 560\u500d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b085 - 520:1\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u73878 - 62%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500< 20ms\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63a5\u8fd10%\uff0c\u5bf9IoT - 23\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "EDS\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u653b\u9632\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoHalLo\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5411\u91cf\u6316\u6398\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoHalLo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u3002", "result": "CoHalLo\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u73870.4253\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CoHalLo\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u884c\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes.

A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family.

To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.\n  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction.

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790FM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u5730\u56fe\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u9608\u503c\u540e\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FM\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u89c6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790FM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5730\u56fe\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9010\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u53d8\u591a\u79cdFM\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u9a8c\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u5de9\u56fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8d77\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u50a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u540e\u9971\u548c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u9760\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned.

The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions.

However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger.

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFineFT\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u671f\u8d27\u4ea4\u6613\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u4ea4\u6613\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e12\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6760\u6746\u671f\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6FineFT\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u96c6\u6210Q\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4Q\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u6839\u636eVAE\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u4ea4\u6613\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cFineFT\u57286\u4e2a\u8d22\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e12\u4e2aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8d8540%\uff0c\u76c8\u5229\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\uff0cVAE\u8def\u7531\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u5927\u56de\u64a4\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making.

Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3).

Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch.

To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5176\u4e24\u4e24\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6700\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\\mathsf p_{\\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\\sqrt{\\mathsf p_{\\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u7814\u7a76GLA\u548cGCA\u4e24\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GLA\u548cGCA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "GLA\u635f\u5931\u65cf\u662f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u5047\u8bbe\u96c6\u4e3aH-\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bGCA\u635f\u5931\u65cf\u5bf9\u6709\u754c\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u5047\u8bbe\u96c6\u90fd\u4e3aH-\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0cGLA\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u7a0d\u597d\uff0cGCA\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "GLA\u548cGCA\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.\n  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.\n  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6700\u4f18\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u9700\u4e0d\u65ad\u91cd\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6700\u4f18\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cVulcan\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LLM\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7528Vulcan\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u9010\u51fa\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u5c42\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8669%\u548c7.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6700\u4f18\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPreguss\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u56e0\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u590d\u6742\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95f4\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPreguss\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6cbb\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u5143\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u522b\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95f4\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "result": "Preguss\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9\u8d85\u5343\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u81ea\u7531\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1180.6% - 88.9%\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Preguss\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5411\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u5e94\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ece\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u5236\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u89d2\u8272\u4ece\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5230\u62a4\u680f\u518d\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u5143\u7d20\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u3001\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u969c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDynaFix\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u590d\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynaFix\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u4fee\u590d\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u82e5\u8865\u4e01\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5931\u8d25\u5219\u91cd\u65b0\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6536\u96c6\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Defects4J v1.2\u548cv2.0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fee\u590d186\u4e2a\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4fee\u590d38\u4e2a\uff0c\u6700\u591a35\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u786e\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1170%\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaFix\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u590d\u6742\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime.

The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent.

We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations.

They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling.

The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u6027\u800c\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u5229\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u95f4\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a84\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u529b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u79cd\u5b50\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u5927\u4e14\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u6709\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f31\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65f6\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e14\u4e0d\u5931\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence.

Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process.

However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory.

While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the \"add passenger\" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eB/S\u67b6\u6784\u548cSpring Cloud\u7684\u94c1\u8def\u8d2d\u7968\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5bb9\u9519\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u4f4e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u94c1\u8def\u7968\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8282\u5047\u65e5\u7b49\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528B/S\u67b6\u6784\u548cSpring Cloud\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5236\u5b9a\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u5217\u8f66\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5ea7\u4f4d\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u5728\u7ebf\u8d2d\u7968\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u4e0b\u6709\u826f\u597d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery.

To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants.

Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics.

While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships.

To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences.

Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.\n  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset.

We formalize \\emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \\emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family).

This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing.

Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $\u03b8_0$ with current iterate $\u03b8_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(\u03b8_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $\u03b8_0$, $\u03b8_T$, and $z$.

Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques.

We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \\times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure.

We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments.

We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical \"transition\" regime maximizes generalization capability.

We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e13\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bSTAgent\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\u8d4b\u80fd\uff0c\u5728TravelBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u884c\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u5341\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79cd\u5b50SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u4e8c\u6b21SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u6700\u7ec8RL\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "STAgent\u5728TravelBench\u4e0a\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578bSTAgent\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%.

We applied OCR techniques, generative AI decoding constraints that structure data extraction, and database linkage methods to process typewritten historical records into a digital format. OCR achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.08 percent and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.06 percent, while JSON extraction from OCR text achieved an average accuracy of 63 percent and, based on annotated OCR, 65 percent. This indicates that generative AI somewhat corrects low OCR performance. Our record linkage algorithm linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%.

Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy.

To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity.

We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faERPM\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6807ERPM\uff0c\u7528\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u6d41\u5f62\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0eMRRE\u548cLocal Procrustes\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8c31\u6d4b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff0cERPM\u4e0eLocal Procrustes\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u5c40\u90e8\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "ERPM\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

MuPa-ZTE improves patient comfort and motion robustness, and generates quantitative maps of T1, T2, and proton density using the acquired weighted image series. In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based qMRI mapping method that leverages both a deep generative model and physics-based data consistency to further improve the mapping performance. Furthermore, our method enables additional acquisition acceleration, allowing high-quality qMRI mapping from a fourfold-accelerated MuPa-ZTE scan (approximately 1 minute). Specifically, we trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, and we incorporated the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as an explicit data consistency (DC) constraint during inference. We compared our mapping method against a baseline dictionary matching approach and a purely data-driven diffusion model. The diffusion models were trained entirely on synthetic data generated from digital brain phantoms, eliminating the need for large real-scan datasets. We evaluated on synthetic data, a NISM/ISMRM phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with brain metastases. The results demonstrated that our method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise and better preservation of structural details. Notably, it generalised well to real scans despite training on synthetic data alone.

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG.

Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets.

Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions.

In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively.

For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action.

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns.

For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.\n  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.\n  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.\n  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance.

Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior.

Project: https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/gardo_project", "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGARDO\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u727a\u7272\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGARDO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGARDO\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GARDO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile.

However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eVlasov - Poisson - Landau\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6709\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3Landau\u78b0\u649e\u9879\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8026\u5408\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eVPFP\u548cEP\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6821\u51c6VPFP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u6301\u7684SPINN\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6709\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u949f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring.

Includes a complete runnable reference implementation and audit logging framework", "summary": "Reinforcement learning is increasingly used to transform large language models into agentic systems that act over long horizons, invoke tools, and manage memory under partial observability. While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.\n  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks.

Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6SaM2B\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u968f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6SaM2B\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u591a\u6e90\u8868\u5f81\u6ce2\u675f\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSaM2B\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SaM2B\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost.

However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance.

Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency.

While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u8106\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u754c\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u8282\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5168\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5168\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6ede\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF >= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3.

Rethinking Proxy-Model Practice", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6309\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u635f\u5931\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u572823\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\u5e94\u662f\u627e\u51fa\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels.

Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone.

Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728PTB - XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u5982Smooth Adversarial Perturbations\u7b49\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u5927\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR)\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u751f\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Structural Causal Model (SCM)\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u53d8\u75c5\u7406\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728PTB - XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCPR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728SAP\u653b\u51fb\u4e0bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.632\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eMedian Smoothing 9.1%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eRandomized Smoothing\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u904d\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CPR\u80fd\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback.

This investigation employs a quantitative analysis approach, extracting information from a questionnaire completed by 346 educators from various regions of Brazil regarding their AI literacy and use. Educators vary in their educational level, years of experience, and type of educational institution. The analysis of the questionnaires shows that although most educators had only basic or limited knowledge of AI (80.3\\%), they showed a strong interest in its application, particularly for the creation of interactive content (80.6%), lesson planning (80.2%), and personalized assessment (68.6%). The potential of AI to promote inclusion and personalized learning is also widely recognized (65.5%). The participants emphasized the importance of discussing ethics and digital citizenship, reflecting on technological dependence, biases, transparency, and responsible use of AI, aligning with critical education and the development of conscious students. Despite enthusiasm for the pedagogical potential of AI, significant structural challenges were identified, including a lack of training (43.4%), technical support (41.9%), and limitations of infrastructure, such as low access to computers, reliable Internet connections, and multimedia resources in schools. The study shows that Brazil is still in a bottom-up model for AI integration, missing official curricula to guide its implementation and structured training for teachers and students. Furthermore, effective implementation of AI depends on integrated public policies, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to technology, promoting ethical, inclusive, and contextually grounded adoption of AI in Brazilian K-12 education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u5df4\u897fK - 12\u6559\u80b2\u6559\u5e08\u5bf9\u901a\u7528AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u591a\u6570\u6559\u5e08AI\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u4f46\u5174\u8da3\u6d53\u539a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5df4\u897fK - 12\u6559\u80b2\u6559\u5e08\u5bf9\u901a\u7528AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9346\u540d\u6765\u81ea\u5df4\u897f\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u95ee\u5377\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005AI\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9AI\u5e94\u7528\u5174\u8da3\u6d53\u539a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u4e92\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230AI\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5305\u5bb9\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u8ba8\u8bba\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u516c\u6c11\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u5df4\u897fAI\u6574\u5408\u5904\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5df4\u897fK - 12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u65bdAI\u9700\u7efc\u5408\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u5145\u8db3\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6280\u672f\u63a5\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u548c\u56e0\u5730\u5236\u5b9c\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues.

We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error.

We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD.

However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network.

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NL\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u597d\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u89e3\u7b54\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8868\u8fbe\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e3aHope\u6a21\u5757", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "NL\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u9501\u6709\u6548\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b"}}

The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDCL - DECOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\u6062\u590d\u4e0a\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4f1a\u8bef\u5224\u5168\u5c40\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u65e0\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684DCL - DECOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u666e\u904d\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0DAG\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u6062\u590d\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65e0\u5f13\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6df7\u6742\u4e0b\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u679c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6df7\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0DAG\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\u6062\u590d\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DCL - DECOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the first-person experience of turning to a conversational AI agent in a mental health crisis. From a testimonial survey (n = 53) of lived experiences, we find that people use AI agents to fill the in-between spaces of human support; they turn to AI due to lack of access to mental health professionals or fears of burdening others. At the same time, our interviews with mental health experts (n = 16) suggest that human-human connection is an essential positive action when managing a mental health crisis. Using the stages of change model, our results suggest that a responsible AI crisis intervention is one that increases the user's preparedness to take a positive action while de-escalating any intended negative action.

However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains.

However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728FPGA\u5e73\u53f0\u751f\u6210\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u57284096\u00d74096\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f1.71\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.29\u500d\uff1b\u5728LLaMA - 7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bcf\u4ee4\u724c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad81.36\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6N:M\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0cFPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u591a\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices.

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry.

High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions.

When AI mediates between the public and policymakers, accuracy across intersecting identities becomes consequential; inaccurate group-level estimates can mislead outreach, consultation, and policy design. While research examines intersectionality in LLM outputs, no study has compared these outputs against real human responses across intersecting identities. Climate policy is one such domain, and this is particularly urgent for climate change, where opinion is contested and diverse. We investigate how LLMs represent intersectional patterns in U.S. climate opinions. We prompted six LLMs with profiles of 978 respondents from a nationally representative U.S. climate opinion survey and compared AI-generated responses to actual human answers across 20 questions. We find that LLMs appear to compress the diversity of American climate opinions, predicting less-concerned groups as more concerned and vice versa. This compression is intersectional: LLMs apply uniform gender assumptions that match reality for White and Hispanic Americans but misrepresent Black Americans, where actual gender patterns differ.

However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension.

We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data.

Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making.

Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting.

Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods.

By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems.

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSNL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u534a\u91cd\u53e0\u591a\uff08\u591a\u81c2\uff09\u8001\u864e\u673a\uff08SOMMAB\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528GapE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u6307\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u548cML\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f19\u4f34\u8d21\u732e\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u5229\u5019\u9009\u8005\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u987a\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSNL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SOMMAB\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528GapE\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u6307\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u4e0e\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5171\u4eab\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u591a\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u5019\u9009\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected.

Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation.

Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space.

We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301remasking\u6216revision\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u542f\u7528revision\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3aDLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210token\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eDLMs\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u652f\u6301remasking\u6216revision\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "DLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u957f\u5ea6CoT\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6b65\u9aa4\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u652f\u6301remasking\u6216revision\u53ef\u4f7fDLMs\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6709revision\u6216remasking\u7684DLMs\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aDLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u5728DLMs\u4e2d\u542f\u7528revision\u3002"}}

However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVBench, a challenging audio physics-sensitivity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the audio physics grounding capabilities of existing T2AV models. PhyAVBench comprises 1,000 groups of paired text prompts with controlled physical variables that implicitly induce sound variations, enabling a fine-grained assessment of models' sensitivity to changes in underlying acoustic conditions. We term this evaluation paradigm the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST). Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily focus on audio-video synchronization, PhyAVBench explicitly evaluates models' understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying sound generation, covering 6 major audio physics dimensions, 4 daily scenarios (music, sound effects, speech, and their mix), and 50 fine-grained test points, ranging from fundamental aspects such as sound diffraction to more complex phenomena, e.g., Helmholtz resonance. Each test point consists of multiple groups of paired prompts, where each prompt is grounded by at least 20 newly recorded or collected real-world videos, thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage during model pre-training. Both prompts and videos are iteratively refined through rigorous human-involved error correction and quality control to ensure high quality. We argue that only models with a genuine grasp of audio-related physical principles can generate physically consistent audio-visual content.

A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResponseRank\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807PDC\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u4ec5\u4f20\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u96be\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u5608\u6742\u4e14\u6709\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6309\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5c42\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ResponseRank\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0cPDC\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u57fa\u6570\u6548\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space.

Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration.

To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods.

Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience.

Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel.

Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training.

This arXiv version updates Figure 1 to include the concurrent work Qwen2.5-VL to ensure consistency with Table 1", "summary": "Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach.

Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures.

To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks.

Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks.

However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline.

Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome).

Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size.

Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDRL\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6DRL - TH\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u8f66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UGV\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u907f\u969c\u7684DRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u5e27\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRL - TH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165TG - GAT\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6743\u91cd\u5230\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1GHAM\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u6c60\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "DRL - TH\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u8f66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DRL - TH\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728UGV\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u907f\u969c\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

That is, for a given decision problem, firms considering deploying a model should make a good-faith effort to find equally performant models with lower disparate impact across social groups. Evidence from the literature on model multiplicity shows that randomness in training pipelines can lead to multiple models with the same performance, but meaningful variations in disparate impact. This suggests that developers can find LDAs simply by randomly retraining models. Firms cannot continue retraining forever, though, which raises the question: What constitutes a good-faith effort? In this paper, we formalize LDA search via model multiplicity as an optimal stopping problem, where a model developer with limited information wants to produce strong evidence that they have sufficiently explored the space of models. Our primary contribution is an adaptive stopping algorithm that yields a high-probability upper bound on the gains achievable from a continued search, allowing the developer to certify (e.g., to a court) that their search was sufficient. We provide a framework under which developers can impose stronger assumptions about the distribution of models, yielding correspondingly stronger bounds.

To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing.

To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783).

Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation.

To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner.

Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\\tilde{O}(\\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\\varepsilon$-optimality. The sample complexity is further improved to $O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ (without the hidden logarithm factor) to achieve the last-iterate $\\varepsilon$-optimality based on adaptive policy update step sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

The main paper has 16 figures", "summary": "The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemantic Lookout\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u4e8b\u81ea\u4e3b\u8239\u8236\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u5907\u673a\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c06VLMs\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u5907\u673a\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ee1\u8db3IMO MASS Code\u8349\u6848\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u6d77\u4e8b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6808\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Semantic Lookout\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f - \u6162\u901f\u5f02\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u572840\u4e2a\u6e2f\u53e3\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4e9a10\u79d2\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540e\u5907\u673a\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u5c06VLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u8349\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u5907\u673a\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies.

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM).

While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space.

As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8d85\u58f0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bUSF - MAE\u7528\u4e8e\u5b55\u65e9\u671f\u80ce\u513f\u5fc3\u810f\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u5148\u5929\u5f02\u5e38\u53ca\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u53d1\u75c5\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5b55\u65e9\u671f\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u56e0\u5fc3\u810f\u7ed3\u6784\u5c0f\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u800c\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u8d8537\u4e07\u5f20\u6db5\u76d640\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5bf9USF - MAE\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u76846720\u5f20\u5b55\u65e9\u671f\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e94\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08ResNet - 18\u548cResNet - 50\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ViT - B/16\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUSF - MAE\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738790.57%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u738791.15%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u738790.57%\uff0cF1\u5206\u657090.71%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebfResNet - 18\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad82.03%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad81.98%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u6fc0\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u88c1\u526a\u5373\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u533a\u5206\u975e\u8bca\u65ad\u5e27\u3002"}}

However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines.

Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems.

One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask.

While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5CREST\uff0c\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCREST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79bb\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65cb\u8f6c\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cCREST\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534717.5%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1137.6%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "CREST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66\u8bfb\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u5ba4\uff08TPC\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eTPC\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u51cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5b66\u8bfb\u51faTPC\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u53d6\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u5728\u672c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u7c92\u5b50\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u53d6\u7d27\u51d1\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4fdd\u755993.0\u00b10.2%\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u53bb\u966497.8\u00b10.1%\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9762\u79ef\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u6bcf\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea625ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672c\u5e95\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e3a\u5149\u5b66TPC\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u51cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u4e0e\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u804a\u5929\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528NLP\u63d0\u53d6\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u7528\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8ba1\u7b97VM\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8def\u7531\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0VM\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u8def\u7531\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0cLLM\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0cSentence - BERT+SVM\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOptiVote\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149AirComp\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u5e72AirComp\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u6301\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOptiVote\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210signSGD\u3001\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u539f\u5219\u548cPPM\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u80fd\u91cf\u79ef\u7d2f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0CSI\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1FSO\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u805a\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "OptiVote\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u592a\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6d88\u9664\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u4f24\u4e0b\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u805a\u5408\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment.

This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PINNs\u3001DeepONet\u3001GNS\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5ca9\u571f\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u52a3\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ca9\u571f\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PINNs\u3001DeepONet\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u3001GNS\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6881 - \u57fa\u7840\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u3002", "result": "PINNs \u6bd4\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u6162 90000 \u500d\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\uff1bDeepONet \u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u624d\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5916\u63a8\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1bGNS \u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u6c42\u89e3\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u79d2\u7ea7\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u5730\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u6210\u719f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002"}}

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHMP - DRL\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHMP - DRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u672c\u5730DRL\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHMP - DRL\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u672c\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry.

We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making.

Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others.

Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations.

Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks.

Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains.

Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation.

Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLSRE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06VLM\u5224\u65ad\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u9075\u5faa\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u96be\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSRE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684VLM\u5224\u65ad\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u516d\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLSRE\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5927VLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u65e9\u9884\u8b66\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5c11\u89c1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bed\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations.

For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u7ef4\u8272\u6563PDE\u5b64\u6ce2\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u7ef4\u8272\u6563PDE\u5b64\u6ce2\u89e3\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u5982Petviashvili\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u725b\u987f\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PINNs\uff09\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95ee\u9898\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u5f3a\uff1bPINNs\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u5982\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u8de8\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u63a8\u7406\u5feb\uff0c\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e00\u822c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPINNs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u62df\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.\n  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence.

However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%.

To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency.

This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias.

In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained.

However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$\u03c0$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$\u03c0$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach.

We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources.

CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdProDM\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u975e\u95e8\u63a7CT\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u65e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9499\u5316\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347CAC\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\uff08CAC\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53d7\u5fc3\u810f\u548c\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u95e8\u63a7CT\u56e0\u8981\u6c42\u53ca\u8d39\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u975e\u95e8\u63a7CT\u4f2a\u5f71\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u95e8\u63a7CT\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProDM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542bCAC\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProDM\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8CAC\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u75c5\u53d8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8bfb\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u80f8\u90e8CT\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760CAC\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions.

Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models.

Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165Thought Gestalt (TG) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u201c\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u72b6\u6001\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u5411\u6cdb\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u5f0f\u542f\u53d1\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53e5\u5b50\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u751f\u6210\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u5173\u6ce8\u5148\u524d\u53e5\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u7ec4\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTG\u6bd4\u5339\u914d\u7684GPT - 2\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0cGPT - 2\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230TG\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff1bTG\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7236\u5b50\u53cd\u8f6c\u8bc5\u5492\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u5411\u6cdb\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "TG\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u5411\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u754c\u9762\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5168\u8eab\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5934\u90e8\u3001\u624b\u90e8\u548c\u817f\u90e8\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u534f\u8c03\u662f\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f4\u89c2\u5b50\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Choice Policy\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d17\u7897\u673a\u88c5\u8f7d\u548c\u767d\u677f\u64e6\u62ed\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cChoice Policy\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff0c\u4e14\u624b\u773c\u534f\u8c03\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.
