The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u7528\u9014AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3aHPV\u75ab\u82d7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "HPV\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u5e26\u6765\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001Retrieval - Augmented Generation\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u75280 - 5\u5206\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\u9ad8\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8eHPV\u75ab\u82d7\u53cc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online.

This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure.

Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $\u03c1>1$ the problem is not $\u03c1$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49minCost - EFx\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6216\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u51faminCost - EFx\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eNP - \u96be\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6838\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u672c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u6709NP - \u96be\u6027\uff1b\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6838\uff1b\u786e\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e9b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53d7\u9650\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8003\u8651\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0cminCost - EFx\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV < 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction.

Xinyue Ma and Heelim Hong contributed equally (co-first authors)", "summary": "Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faORBITFLOW\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bf7\u6c42\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u7ec4\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u4f7f\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5cf0\u503c\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u8fdd\u53cd\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\uff08SLO\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ILP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u51b3\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u54ea\u4e9b\u5c42\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4fdd\u7559\u5728GPU\uff1b\u6839\u636e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u91cd\u8f7d\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u56de\u9000\u673a\u5236\u6682\u65f6\u63a8\u8fdf\u5927\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "result": "ORBITFLOW\u4f7fTPOT\u548cTBT\u7684SLO\u8fbe\u6210\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad866%\u548c48%\uff0c95%\u5206\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e38%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad83.3\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ORBITFLOW\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdfSLO\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems.

Using function fusion, multiple functions can be combined into a single deployment unit, which can be used to reduce cost and latency of complex serverless applications comprising multiple functions. Even in small-scale applications, the number of possible fusion configurations is vast, making brute-force benchmarking in production both cost- and time-prohibitive.\n  In this paper, we present a system that can analyze every possible fusion setup of complex applications.

Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $\u03ba$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $\u03ba$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt\u03ba m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrt\u03ba$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(\u03ba^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $\u03ba^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance.

The BSDE framework offers a computationally efficient alternative to PDE-based methods, and recently proposed deep BSDE solvers, generally utilizing conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), build upon this framework to provide a scalable alternative to numerical BSDE solvers. In this research, we show that although such MLP-based deep BSDEs demonstrate promising results in option pricing, there remains room for improvement regarding hedging performance. To address this issue, we introduce KANHedge, a novel BSDE-based hedger that leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the BSDE framework. Unlike conventional MLP approaches that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable B-spline activation functions that provide enhanced function approximation capabilities for continuous derivatives.

While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:\n  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.\n  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments.

Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios.

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters.

Multiscaling has profound implications for financial modelling: it affects extreme risk estimation, influences optimal portfolio allocation across different time horizons, and challenges traditional option pricing approaches that assume uniscaling behaviours. Understanding whether multiscaling arises primarily from the roughness of volatility paths or from the resulting fat-tailed returns has important implications for financial modelling, option pricing, and risk management. This paper investigates the real source of this multiscaling behaviour by introducing a novel two-stage statistical testing procedure. In the first stage, we establish the presence of multiscaling in the rBergomi model against an uniscaling fractional Brownian motion process. We quantify multiscaling by using weighted least squares regression that accounts for heteroscedastic estimation errors across moments. In the second stage, we apply shuffled surrogates that preserve return distributions while destroying temporal correlations. This is done by using distance-based permutation tests robust to asymmetric null distributions. In order to validate our procedure, we check the robustness of the results by using synthetic processes with known multifractal properties, namely the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) and the Fractional L\u00e9vy Stable Motion (FLSM). We provide compelling evidence that multiscaling in the rBergomi model arises primarily from fat-tailed return distributions rather than memory effects. Our findings suggest that the apparent multiscaling in rough volatility models is largely attributable to distributional properties rather than genuine temporal scaling behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7814\u7a76rBergomi\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u80a5\u5c3e\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u8fd8\u662f\u80a5\u5c3e\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6bd4rBergomi\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5355\u6807\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u6807\u5ea6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u6253\u4e71\u66ff\u4ee3\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6392\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u8fd8\u7528MRW\u548cFLSM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u5145\u5206\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660erBergomi\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6807\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u80a5\u5c3e\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c97\u7cd9\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6807\u5ea6\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Existing density-based clustering algorithms have employed different algorithmic means to counter the effect of the high-density bias with some success, but the fundamental limitation of using density distribution remains an obstacle to discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. Using the mass distribution as a better foundation, we propose a new algorithm which maximizes the total mass of all clusters, called mass-maximization clustering (MMC). The algorithm can be easily changed to maximize the total density of all clusters in order to examine the fundamental limitation of using density distribution versus mass distribution.

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines.

Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the \"Poisoned Apple\" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor.

Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead.

We consider a setting where users can visit a news website at any time, and upon each visit, the website must display up to $k$ news items. User interactions are inherently stochastic: each news item presented to the user is consumed with a certain acceptance probability by the user, and each news item covers certain topics. Our goal is to design a streaming algorithm that maximizes the expected total topic coverage. To address this problem, we establish a connection to submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint. We show that we can effectively adapt previous methods to address our problem when the number of user visits is known in advance or linear-size memory in the stream length is available. However, in more realistic scenarios where only an upper bound on the visits and sublinear memory is available, the algorithms fail to guarantee any bounded performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new online streaming algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(8\u03b4)$, where $\u03b4$ controls the approximation quality.

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\\mathrm{Re}\\approx2\\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain.

We find that the best instructed retrievers improve on ranking relevance compared to instruction-agnostic approaches. However, we also find that instruction following performance, crucial to the user experience of interacting with models, does not mirror ranking relevance improvements and displays insensitivity or counter-intuitive behavior to instructions. Our results indicate that while users may benefit from using current instructed retrievers over instruction-agnostic models, they may not benefit from using them for long-running exploratory sessions requiring greater sensitivity to instructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u65b9\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u79cd\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u67e5\u8be2\u610f\u56fe\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u67e5\u8be2\u610f\u56fe\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u671f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f7f\u7528Pairwise Ranking Prompting\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u80fd\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u6216\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u957f\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d7\u76ca\u3002"}}

However, optimising its energy requirements still remains a challenge within the community, especially for embedded applications. One solution may reside in preprocessing events to optimise data quantity thus lowering the energy cost on neuromorphic hardware, proportional to the number of synaptic operations. To this end, we extend an end-to-end neuromorphic line detection mechanism to introduce line-based event data preprocessing. Our results demonstrate on three benchmark event-based datasets that preprocessing leads to an advantageous trade-off between energy consumption and classification performance. Depending on the line-based preprocessing strategy and the complexity of the classification task, we show that one can maintain or increase the classification accuracy while significantly reducing the theoretical energy consumption. Our approach systematically leads to a significant improvement of the neuromorphic classification efficiency, thus laying the groundwork towards a more frugal neuromorphic computer vision thanks to event preprocessing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u5229\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u5229\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The method can be viewed as a smooth generalization of the widely-known linear interpolation scheme, and retains the simplicity and transparency of that baseline. Calibration of the model to observed market quotes is formulated as a linear program, allowing bid-ask spreads to be incorporated directly via linear penalties or inequalities, and delivering materially lower computational cost than most of the currently available implied-volatility surface fitting routines. As a further contribution, we derive an equivalent parameterization of the proposed surface in terms of strictly positive \"discrete local volatility\" variables. This yields, to our knowledge, the first construction of smooth, strictly arbitrage-free option price surfaces while requiring only trivial parameter constraints (positivity).

In scientific software (SSW), such debt poses unique risks to the validity and reproducibility of results. Objective: This study aims to identify, categorize, and evaluate scientific debt, a specialized form of SATD in SSW, and assess the extent to which traditional SATD categories capture these domain-specific issues. Method: We conduct a multi-artifact analysis across code comments, commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers from 23 open-source SSW projects. We construct and validate a curated dataset of scientific debt, develop a multi-source SATD classifier, and conduct a practitioner validation to assess the practical relevance of scientific debt. Results: Our classifier performs strongly across 900,358 artifacts from 23 SSW projects. SATD is most prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers, underscoring the value of multi-artifact analysis. Models trained on traditional SATD often miss scientific debt, emphasizing the need for its explicit detection in SSW. Practitioner validation confirmed that scientific debt is both recognizable and useful in practice. Conclusions: Scientific debt represents a unique form of SATD in SSW that that is not adequately captured by traditional categories and requires specialized identification and management. Our dataset, classification analysis, and practitioner validation results provide the first formal multi-artifact perspective on scientific debt, highlighting the need for tailored SATD detection approaches in SSW.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u503a\u52a1\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u81ea\u627f\u8ba4\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u5de5\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6db5\u76d6\u8be5\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u81ea\u627f\u8ba4\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u79d1\u5b66\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u7edf\u7c7b\u522b\u80fd\u5426\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf923\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u3001\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u3001\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5de5\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6e90\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728900,358\u4e2a\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u81ea\u627f\u8ba4\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5728\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e2d\u6700\u666e\u904d\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u9057\u6f0f\u79d1\u5b66\u503a\u52a1\uff1b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u786e\u8ba4\u79d1\u5b66\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u503a\u52a1\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u81ea\u627f\u8ba4\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6db5\u76d6\uff0c\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUOWQ\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6734\u7d20\u5747\u5300\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u517c\u987e\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5355\u6e90\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u503c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728DomainNet\u548cOffice - Home\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cUOWQ\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "UOWQ\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Performing OD under an unsupervised regime-without any information about anomalous instances in the training data-is challenging. A recently observed phenomenon, known as the inlier-memorization (IM) effect, where deep generative models (DGMs) tend to memorize inlier patterns during early training, provides a promising signal for distinguishing outliers. However, existing unsupervised approaches that rely solely on the IM effect still struggle when inliers and outliers are not well-separated or when outliers form dense clusters. To address these limitations, we incorporate active learning to selectively acquire informative labels, and propose IMBoost, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces the IM effect to improve outlier detection. Our method consists of two stages: 1) a warm-up phase that induces and promotes the IM effect, and 2) a polarization phase in which actively queried samples are used to maximize the discrepancy between inlier and outlier scores.

To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying.

The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality.

The survey also discusses community-driven enhancements to the ROS~2 runtime, including new executor algorithm designs, real-time GPU management, and microcontroller support via micro-ROS. Furthermore, we summarize techniques for bounding DDS communication delays, message filters, and profiling tools that have been developed to support analysis and experimentation.

Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes.

The resulting shrinkage function is odd, continuous on R, and continuously differentiable away from the main threshold, yet retains the hallmark SCAD properties of sparsity for small coefficients and near unbiasedness for large ones. This smoothness places the rule within the continuous thresholding class for which Stein's unbiased risk estimate is valid. As a result, unbiased risk computation, stable data-driven threshold selection, and the asymptotic theory of Kudryavtsev and Shestakov apply.\n  A corresponding nonconvex prior is obtained whose posterior mode coincides with the estimator, yielding a transparent Bayesian interpretation. We give an explicit SURE risk expression, discuss the oracle scale of the optimal threshold, and describe both global and level-dependent adaptive versions.

Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\\% test accuracy. We benchmark post-training hard pruning at target sparsity levels (35--50\\%): pruning 35\\% yields $\\approx$95.5\\% test accuracy, while pruning 50\\% yields $\\approx$88.3--88.6\\%, depending on the dynamic.

We highlight the crucial role played by data centers, which constitute the backbone of the AI ecosystem and have attracted formidable investment in 2025, as they are indispensable for meeting the rapidly increasing worldwide demand for AI services. We document that the boom in IT and AI-related capital expenditure in the first three quarters of the year has given an outsized boost to aggregate demand, while its contribution to GDP growth is smaller once the high import content of AI hardware is netted out. Furthermore, simple calculations suggest that, at current utilization rates and pricing, the production of services originating in new AI data centers could contribute to GDP over the turn of the next quarters on a scale comparable to that of investment spending to date.

Drawing on existing literature and personal experience, this reflective report examines the often-invisible barriers to networking and advocates for a community-driven \"expert voice\" initiative to acknowledge and address these inequities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5efa\u7acb\u4e13\u4e1a\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5021\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u4f1a\u96be\u8bc6\u522b\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5c45\u4f4f\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5efa\u7acb\u4e13\u4e1a\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5021\u5bfc\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u201c\u4e13\u5bb6\u58f0\u97f3\u201d\u5021\u8bae\u6765\u627f\u8ba4\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent.

However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used.

To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%.

Testing PRs is critical to maintaining software quality. Yet, even in projects with extensive test suites, some PR-modified lines remain untested, leaving a \"last-mile\" regression test gap. Existing test generators typically aim to improve overall coverage, but do not specifically target the uncovered lines in PRs. We present Change And Cover (ChaCo), an LLM-based test augmentation technique that addresses this gap. It makes three contributions: (i) ChaCo considers the PR-specific patch coverage, offering developers augmented tests for code just when it is on the developers' mind. (ii) We identify providing suitable test context as a crucial challenge for an LLM to generate useful tests, and present two techniques to extract relevant test content, such as existing test functions, fixtures, and data generators. (iii) To make augmented tests acceptable for developers, ChaCo carefully integrates them into the existing test suite, e.g., by matching the test's structure and style with the existing tests, and generates a summary of the test addition for developer review. We evaluate ChaCo on 145 PRs from three popular and complex open-source projects - SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas. The approach successfully helps 30% of PRs achieve full patch coverage, at the cost of $0.11, showing its effectiveness and practicality. Human reviewers find the tests to be worth adding (4.53/5.0), well integrated (4.2/5.0), and relevant to the PR (4.7/5.0). Ablations show test context is crucial for context-aware test generation, leading to 2x coverage. We submitted 12 tests, of which 8 have already been merged, and two previously unknown bugs were exposed and fixed.

This coupling leads to the \"memory wall,\" where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning).

We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

The data are first partitioned column-wise (or row-wise) and allocated to node servers, where each node estimates the row (or column) loading matrix via two-dimensional tensor PCA. These local estimates are then transmitted to a central server and aggregated, followed by a final PCA step to obtain the global row (or column) loading matrix estimator. Given the estimated loading matrices, the corresponding factor matrices are subsequently computed. Unlike existing distributed approaches, our framework preserves the latent matrix structure, thereby improving computational efficiency and enhancing information utilization. We also discuss row- and column-wise clustering procedures for settings in which the group memberships are unknown.

The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5ARC - AGI\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u5217\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdARC Prize 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u524d\u6cbfAI\u63a8\u7406\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8fd8\u9884\u89c8ARC - AGI - 3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5728ARC - AGI\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9ARC Prize 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u6210\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8c03\u7814\u9ad8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "ARC Prize 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u5438\u5f15\u4f17\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u5728AGI\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5728ARC - AGI\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC - AGI\u6210\u4e3aAI\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dAI\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u672a\u6765ARC - AGI - 3\u5c06\u5f15\u5165\u4e92\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines.

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations.

Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance.

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO).

Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders.

In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22VLP\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684VLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfGEMM\u7684VLP\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Mugi\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMugi\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "VLP\u5df2\u7528\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b - \u6743\u91cdGEMM\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22VLP\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "method": "1. \u63a8\u5e7fVLP\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u503c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f93\u5165GEMM\u4f18\u5316VLP\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684VLP\u67b6\u6784Mugi\u3002", "result": "Mugi\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe45\u500d\u548c668\u500d\uff0c\u5728LLMs\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53472.07\u500d\u548c3.11\u500d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u78b31.45\u500d\u548c\u9690\u542b\u78b31.48\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Mugi\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6846\u67b6AdaMARP\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5173\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaMARP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u6d88\u606f\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAdaRPSet\u3001AdaSMSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165AdaptiveBench\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdaRPSet\u589e\u5f3a\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\uff0c8B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u90e8\u5206\u5546\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1bAdaSMSet\u4f7f\u573a\u666f\u8fc7\u6e21\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c14B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85Claude Sonnet 4.5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones.

Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\\Prob(E_t\\mid\\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event.\n  For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative.\n  We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon.

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection.

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks.

Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics.

As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4bAC\u5206\u6570\u8861\u91cf\u6982\u7387\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b63\u8282\u6027ARIMA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728M4\u5c0f\u65f6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4bAC\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b63\u8282\u6027ARIMA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728M4\u5c0f\u65f6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0cAC\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e75%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4bAC\u5206\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u4ef7\u503c\uff08In - CVaR\uff09\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86In - CVaR\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eIn - CVaR\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7a33\u5065\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u7c7b\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u4eff\u5c04\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5d29\u6e83\u70b9\uff0c\u5206\u6790In - CVaR\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u4fee\u526a\u6700\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u635f\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eIn - CVaR\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728Prokhorov\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u662f\u5b9a\u6027\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90fd\u8868\u660eIn - CVaR\u98ce\u9669\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u7a33\u5065\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBAPO\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5766\u767d\u201c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u201d\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBoundary - Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBAPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BAPO\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

While effective, these methods risk hallucinations and misalignment with collection-specific terminology. We propose a hybrid alternative that preserves the robustness and interpretability of classical PRF while leveraging LLM semantic judgement.

Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0d\u7b49\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f34\u968f/\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u5c42\u9762\u5236\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfcUC\u89c4\u8303\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0d\u7b49\u53d8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u610f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f34\u968f/\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u5c42\u9762\u5236\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u4f4d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08UC\uff09\u4f34\u968f\u66ff\u6362\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8f6c\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faUC\u89c4\u8303\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u3002"}}

We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others.

However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks.

However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks.

A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical.

In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations.

While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u6307\u6570\u5bc6\u96c6\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SEDAM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9DAM\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76SEDAM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u96ea\u5d29\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u751f\u6b7b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de7\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "SEDAM\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u533a\u57df\u6240\u9700\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u968f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u589e\u52a0\u7565\u6709\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records.

These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\\% across forecasting horizons.

Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users.

Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces.

However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns.

To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps.

To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding.

However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemTaint\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u6c61\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230CodeQL\u5de5\u5177\u540e\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u9759\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "JavaScript\u9759\u6001\u6c61\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u63d0\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u3001npm\u5e93\u751f\u6001\u5e9e\u5927\u96be\u8bc6\u522b\u6e90/\u6c47\u53ca\u5efa\u7acb\u6c61\u70b9\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemTaint\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6cd5\u9759\u6001\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u8c03\u7528\u8fb9\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9aCWE\u5206\u7c7b\u6e90\u548c\u6c47\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6c61\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed9SAST\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5c06SemTaint\u96c6\u6210\u5230CodeQL\u540e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa162\u4e2a\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7684106\u4e2a\uff0c\u8fd8\u57284\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cnpm\u5305\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b04\u4e2a\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline.

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance.

Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations.

Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines.

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790SGD\u9009\u62e9\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790SGD\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SGD\u8f68\u8ff9\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cSGD\u566a\u58f0\u91cd\u5851\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL.

Yet research on the effects and possible biases of such interventions faces multiple limitations. For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects.

Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them.

State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, employing increasingly complex audio pipelines designed to be invariant to musical attributes that often vary widely across covers. While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited downstream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal architectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency. First, LIVI leverages supervision from state-of-the-art transcription and text embedding models during training to achieve retrieval accuracy on par with--or superior to--harmonic-based systems.

Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.\n  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.\n  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search.

In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection. However, the copilot did not significantly improve answer correctness or search engagement, largely due to a \"time-on-chat vs. exploration\" trade-off and users' bias toward positive information.

In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces.

The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u63d0\u5347\u5728Spurious - Motif\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u542b\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684Spurious - Motif\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u51fa\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly.

Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality. Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling.

We investigate this phenomenon and identify a \"Perplexity Paradox\": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance.

Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters.

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process.

In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance.

GPA operates on a shared discrete audio token space and supports instruction-driven task induction, enabling a single autoregressive model to flexibly perform TTS, ASR, and VC without architectural modifications. This unified design combines a fully autoregressive formulation over discrete speech tokens, joint multi-task training across speech domains, and a scalable inference pipeline that achieves high concurrency and throughput. The resulting model family supports efficient multi-scale deployment, including a lightweight 0.3B-parameter variant optimized for edge and resource-constrained environments.

A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones.

Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry.

We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases.

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences.

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations.

In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods.

Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ.

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module.

Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance.

By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs.

While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation.

Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points.

However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9690\u853d\u591a\u8f6e\u7ecf\u6d4eDoS\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4ee3\u7406 - \u5de5\u5177\u63a5\u53e3\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DoS\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u4ee3\u7406 - \u5de5\u5177\u901a\u4fe1\u5faa\u73af\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u8f6e\u548c\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7b26\u5408MCP\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e2d\u8c03\u6574\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u89c1\u5b57\u6bb5\u548c\u8fd4\u56de\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528MCTS\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u901a\u77e5\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347658\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u63d0\u5347100 - 560\u500d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdGPU\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u67e5\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406 - \u5de5\u5177\u63a5\u53e3\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8f6c\u5411\u76d1\u63a7\u6574\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation.

Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature.

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0bDLMs\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5b58\u5728RSD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSPREAD\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0LLM\u548cDLM\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5176\u5728DLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5DLMs\u5728RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bRSD\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8ffd\u6eaf\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSPREAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSPREAD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86RSD\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "SPREAD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3DLMs\u5728RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684RSD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u4e3bCPU\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7070\u76d2\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u4e3bCPU\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors.

Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies.

We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks.

Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u51faREVIVE\u6846\u67b6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u987a\u5e8f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51faREVIVE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u6743\u91cd\u8c31\u57fa\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e72\u6270\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5947\u5f02\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cREVIVE\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u8fbe20000\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "REVIVE\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging.

In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts.

Process mining is increasingly investigating fairness. There is a growing area focusing on fairness-aware algorithms. So far, we know less how these concepts perform on empirical healthcare data or how they cover aspects of justice theory. This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework.

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization.

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017COBI\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0McDonald\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5Ising\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u7684CPU\u6216GPU\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017COBI\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5Ising\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u548c\u8026\u5408\u9879\u89c4\u6a21\u5931\u8861\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u6574\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u820d\u5165\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728CNN/DailyMail\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6458\u8981\uff0cCOBI\u6bd4\u66b4\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u67093 - 4.5\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CMOS Ising\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faQUPID\u548cR - QUPID\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u65e5\u5e38\u8fd0\u8425\u9700\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQUPID\uff0c\u5373\u5206\u533a\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5230R - QUPID\u4ee5\u5728\u5305\u542b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u533a\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQUPID\u548cR - QUPID\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "QUPID\u548cR - QUPID\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format.

Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts.

We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model.

Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVIGA\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVIGA\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73afwrite - run - render - compare - revise\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728BlenderGym\u63d0\u534735.32%\uff0cSlideBench\u63d0\u5347117.17%\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684BlenderBench\u63d0\u5347124.70%\u3002", "conclusion": "VIGA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u7840VLMs\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUBiGTLoc\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8282\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u951a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e14RSSI\u6ce2\u52a8\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUBiGTLoc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528BiLSTM\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u6349RSSI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u56feTransformer\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0cUBiGTLoc\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758fWSN\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684RSSI\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "UBiGTLoc\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65e0\u951a\u548c\u6709\u951aWSN\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8282\u70b9\u3002"}}

Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u90e8\u7f72\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e03\u5c40\u591a\u7531\u884c\u653f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u67cf\u6797\u548c\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e34\u65f6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5747\u5300\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ec510\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u67cf\u6797\u548c\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8560%\u548c70%\uff1b\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e5\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4e34\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u6c38\u4e45\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57ce\u5e02\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e03\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e34\u65f6\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u90e8\u7f72\u95f4\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval.

Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces.

However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks.

Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6291\u90c1\u4e0e\u975e\u6291\u90c1\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d6\u5f9798.74%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5ba2\u89c2\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cGRU\u4eceEEG\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528MRMR\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6291\u90c1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.74%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u3002"}}

We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients.

This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency.

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise.

We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions.

To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches.

Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length.

Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes.

This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models.

In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error.

Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\u0394\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge.

Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.\n  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.\n  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features.

This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency.

The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency.

A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49 - \u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u957f\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49 - \u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408MPNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49 - \u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7269\u7406\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u3002"}}

In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design.

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faShapeR\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u968f\u610f\u62cd\u6444\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u751f\u62103D\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u60f3\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u610f\u62cd\u6444\u5e8f\u5217\u76843D\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u30013D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u751f\u62103D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u968f\u610f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "ShapeR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u53472.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapeR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u968f\u610f\u62cd\u6444\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c3D\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
