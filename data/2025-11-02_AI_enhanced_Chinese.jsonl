We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,\nestablishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter\nefficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the\ncritical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,\nincluding B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,\nGaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in\nterms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize\nrecent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving\naccuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed\nloss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and\nspecialized methods for handling discontinuities.

Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known\nto achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic\nlimit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$\nqueue in any regime.\n  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD),\nwhich is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than\nSRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size\ndistributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over\nsmall jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby\nimprove the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a\nnovel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative\nanalysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away\nfrom the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy.

However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on\ntechnical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream\n\"silent fixes\", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a\ndangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM). This\nprovides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.\nBased on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a \"Strategic Objectives Matrix\"\nto clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,\nEx-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and\n(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these\nvulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three\nindustry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.\nThis work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for\nenterprises to shift from reactive \"firefighting\" to proactively building an\norganizational \"immune system\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f00\u6e90\u53c2\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u5c55\u624e\u6839\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6574\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u5e94\u5bf9\u5230\u4e3b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u2018\u514d\u75ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u2019\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5f00\u6e90\u53c2\u4e0e\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6cbb\u7406\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u6218\u672f\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u6574\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u624e\u6839\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0e15\u540d\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u539f\u5219\u6784\u5efa\u2018Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\u2019\u903b\u8f91\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6218\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u77e9\u9635\u2019\u3001\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u884c\u4e1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8bca\u65ad\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u52a9\u5176\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u2018\u6551\u706b\u2019\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u7ec4\u7ec7\u2018\u514d\u75ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u2019\u3002"}}

Cole, Gottlieb, and Lewenstein\n(STOC 2004) proposed $k$-errata trees, a family of text indexes supporting\napproximate pattern matching queries of several types. In particular,\n$k$-errata trees yield an elegant solution to $k$-mismatch queries, where we\nare to report all substrings of the text with Hamming distance at most $k$ to\nthe query pattern. The resulting $k$-mismatch index uses $O(n\\log^k n)$ space\nand answers a query for a length-$m$ pattern in $O(\\log^k n \\log \\log n + m +\nocc)$ time, where $occ$ is the number of approximate occurrences.\n  In retrospect, $k$-errata trees appear very well optimized: even though a\nlarge body of work has adapted $k$-errata trees to various settings throughout\nthe past two decades, the original time-space trade-off for $k$-mismatch\nindexing has not been improved in the general case.

Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans.

Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning\n(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and\nfalls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable\nto depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on\nsubstantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos\nLearning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire\nclassification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns\nin the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the\nGeneralized L\\\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance\nwith ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in\nlow-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is\ninterpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random\nHeterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic\nneurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of\nhuman brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires\nDataset.

This research proposes the use of two separate distributions to\nmore accurately represent the overall data, rather than relying on a single\ndistribution. The global income distribution was fitted to log-normal and gamma\nfunctions, which are standard tools in econophysics. Despite limitations in\ndata completeness during the early years, the available information covered the\nvast majority of the world's population.

A parallel and distributed\n(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time\ncomputation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.\nWe will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes\n(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and\nwireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and\nmassively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for\nsolution of truly large-scale problems in real time.

With the growing environmental impact of cloud\ncomputing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly\nimportant.\n  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on\nopen-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard\nrunners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework\nand we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to\ndate, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000\nrepositories.\n  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a\nsubstantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from\n150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most\npessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5\nkiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon\nfootprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,\nthe carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon\ncaptured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable\nto the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.\n  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted\ncomputational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in\nregions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France\nand the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for\nscheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional\nenergy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of\nrepositories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76GitHub Actions\u7684\u78b3\u548c\u6c34\u8db3\u8ff9\uff08CWF\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176CWF\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u7b49\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u5176CWF\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3CI/CD\u670d\u52a1\u7684CWF\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCloud Carbon Footprint\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u8d85220\u4e07\u6b21\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u8d8518000\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "GitHub Actions\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u663e\u8457CWF\uff0c2024\u5e74\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u5728\u4e50\u89c2\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u4e3a150.5 MTCO2e\uff0c\u60b2\u89c2\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u4e3a994.9 MTCO2e\uff0c\u6c34\u8db3\u8ff9\u57281989.6\u81f337664.5\u5343\u5347\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9456.9 MTCO2e\uff0c\u6c34\u8db3\u8ff95738.2\u5343\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u4f4e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u533a\u90e8\u7f72\u8fd0\u884c\u5668\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e25\u683c\u505c\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4ed3\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u3002"}}

A common\napproach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the\nminority group and then training classification models with both observed and\nsynthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data\nand fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction\naccuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true\ndata. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and\nprovide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the\nmajority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse\neffects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding\noverfitting.

The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal\nCombining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting\ntransformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform\nsolutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental\nvalidation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover\nsignificant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement\nin our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,\nvalidating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548cABLOC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4f55\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u968f\u673a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u63d0\u51faABLOC\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u53d8\u6362\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u53d7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f4e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u76ca\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f55\u65f6\u6295\u8d44\u504f\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u975e\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

For example, comparing two neural\nsystems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and\ndeep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical\nSimilarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems\nbased on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However,\nDSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar\nsystems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because\nreal-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account\nfor the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for\ncomparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA\n(iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both\ninput and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We\ndemonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed,\ninput-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are\nunknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in\nsimilarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\ntrained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing\nnetworks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks\nare more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats\nperforming a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from\ninput-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making.

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u62fc\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u62fc\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u62fc\u8f66\u6a21\u62df\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u95f2\u7f6e\u8f66\u8f86\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8865\u5145\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528n\u6b65\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53478.4%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e58\u5ba2\u8f66\u5185\u548c\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u53ef\u4f7f\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8525%\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u524a\u51cf\u7b49\u5f85\u548c\u8f66\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u62fc\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

In particular, we show that in\nthe dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the\nWishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas\nprior private algorithms failed to do so.\n  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under\nGaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian\nmechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We\nconjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including\nplanted problems in graphs.\n  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems.

Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station.

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent\nframework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging\na diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a\nstructured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.\nDuring the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each\nembodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines\nan initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates\na plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed\noracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this\nexecution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using\nthe specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before\nre-validation.

This has led\nto increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose\ninternal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong\nperformance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft\nprompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial\ndata points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and\n(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency\nwithin each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization.

We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using\nautomated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by\ncomparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)\napproach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in\ntest pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,\nDeepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)\nscores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from\n12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453\nand 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows\nover 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation\ncriteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in\nreadability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated\nrefactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and\nLOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,\nemphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source\nbenchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Python\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u6279\u8bc4\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u591a\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a3B - 8B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u6279\u8bc4\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9012\u5f52\u6279\u8bc4\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u6570\u548c\u5708\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u8d8570%\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u57fa\u3002"}}

To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured\ndatasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin\nclassifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch\nAdam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the\nlimiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize\nits convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.\nFinally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges\nto the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$\nclose enough to 1.

We evaluate our\nresults in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach\nto online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces\ntime and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u8c03\u8bd5\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6ee1\u8db3\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u5bf918\u4f4d\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While source code metrics provide useful indicators of\nvulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that\nlead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process\nmetrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are\nessential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work\nhighlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in\nunderstanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond\nfile-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,\nfocusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also\non the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and\nre-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of\none isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and\nsocio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study\non the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as\nbus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction\nactivities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our\nfindings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage\nand fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue\nmanagement and team responsiveness.

Geospatial\nFoundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse\nspatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be\nefficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the\npredictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population\nDynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite\nimagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine\nhealth programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to\ntraditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data\nfrom 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance\nwith R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold\ncross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the\nembedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13\nof 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three\nembedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average\n5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),\nnew HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,\n0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with\nlow primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases.

Specifically, we examine the dataless\napplication of neural network architectures in optimization by\nre-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,\ngraph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve\nlinear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing\nattention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including\nthose based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial\ndifferential equations.

We\naddress these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which\ndynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and\nemploys graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning\nsignals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward\nhigh-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware\ncredit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's\nstrategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench\nbenchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success\nrate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These\nresults highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,\ngeneralizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GEPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u77ed\u89c6\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728ALFWorld\u3001WebShop\u548c\u4e13\u6709Workbench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGEPO\u8f83\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86+4.1%\u3001+5.3%\u548c+10.9%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u63a8\u8fdbLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To maximize spectral\nefficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to\nselects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is\nNP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal\nsolutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.\nThis paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit\nunsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing\nstudies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact\nvalues of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink\ntransmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an\nobservation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to\nimprove training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and\nlower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based\nsolely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by\nleveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of\na neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of\nintentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the\nwhole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by\nadversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce\nthe network throughput of a victim up to 70\\% without knowing the exact value\nof victims' local observations.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools.

However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are\nfaced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the\nbug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which\nis not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit\nmessage frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They\nare also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines\ndeleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.\n  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nwell-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend\nboth textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC\nidentification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive\nmulti-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch\ninformation, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)\nprogressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection\nsteps.

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee).

To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and\nhippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior\nperformance.

Results show that\nthe hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame\ndiversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only\nsetting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all\nmetrics, except for annotation time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u6807\u6ce8\u5668\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cFrameNet\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u534a\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u9664\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7eaf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9664\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\uff0c\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cFrameNet\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002"}}

Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%.

Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics.

The framework includes a\nself-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain\nenvironment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the\nself-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the\ncompetitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),\nand the hybrid Agent~B$^\\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the\nother two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and\naffect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify\nbehavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals\npotentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.\n  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a\nzero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening\naverage spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency.

However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684AI\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edfDARTS\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u91c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe99%\uff0c\u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1DARTS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7a7a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u91c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u738799%\uff0c\u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6bd4\u5f53\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65e912\u5206\u949f\u68c0\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ffd\u5c3e\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u53ef\u76d1\u6d4b\u62e5\u5835\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "DARTS\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates.

Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%\nwomen), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules.

Compared with patients\nwithout ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,\nbiopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were\npapillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were\ncommon and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,\nlow-risk cancers.

Existing approaches often\nignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.\nTo overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the\nparameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the\nminimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that\ncombines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.\nProspects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian\ndistributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and\nadapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating\nsurfaces and more complex structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f2f\u6069\u65af\u5766\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6982\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f2f\u6069\u65af\u5766\u57fa\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6982\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cRMSE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals.

PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by\nsolely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods\nthat primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.\nConsequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal\ndiffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with\nfixed prompts.

Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E).

To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS).

Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce\nspatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.\nConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in\nWaterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects\nin ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model\ndiagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faConceptScope\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df2\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "ConceptScope\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction.

Our work addresses this gap by introducing\nStreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities\nunder real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations\nacross different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,\nQwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and\nMamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to\nprobe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs\ngenerally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in\ntasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the\ncorrect answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when\nsolving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and\napproximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.\nDrawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not\nexhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math\nsettings.

Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have\nemerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage\ndensity, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of\nmirror-image peptides relies on \\textit{de-novo} technology. However, its\naccuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and\nthe challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides\ndirectly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy\nindirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this\nwork, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates\nsequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry\nenvironmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.\nIn this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are\neasy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as\nfollows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset\ncontaining 513 mirror-image peptides.

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior\nnetwork and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse\nlocalization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial\nguidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises\nfour essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric\ncross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures\nglobal semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses\non features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the\nglobal and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed\nacross all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the\nflow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the\nfinal encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and\nutilization.

We evaluate InfoFlow on\nmultiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong\nbaselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to\nadvanced proprietary LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInfoFlow\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfoFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "InfoFlow\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoFlow\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient.
