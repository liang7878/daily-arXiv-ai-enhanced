In 2019, Disser and Hopp [DH\n5] argued that there were errors in Friedmann's 2011 construction. In 2020,\nDisser, Friedmann, and Hopp [DFH 3,4] again contended that the least-entered\nrule was exponential. We show that their arguments contain multiple flaws. In\nother words, the worst-case behavior of the least-entered rule has not been\nestablished. Neither [F 7] nor [DFH 3,4] provides pathological linear programs\nthat can be tested. Instead, the authors contend that their pathological linear\nprograms are of the form (P) as shown on page 12 of [DFH 3]. The authors\ncontend that the constraints of (P) ensure that the probability of entering a\nvertex u is equal to the probability of exiting u. In fact, we note that the\nauthors' constraints (P) are flawed in at least three ways: a) they require the\nprobability of exiting u to exceed the probability of entering u, b) they\nrequire the probability of exiting some nodes to exceed 1, and c) they overlook\nflows from decision nodes to decision nodes. At my request, in August of 2025,\nDisser, Friedmann, and Hopp provided me with their first ten purportedly\npathological LPs and the graph of their first purportedly pathological Markov\nDecision Process (MDP1). It is shown that: a) their first two pathological LPs\nare infeasible if the variables are supposed to be probabilities, as the\nauthors contend, and b) their first purportedly pathological LP does not match\nup with their first purportedly pathological MDP. In other words, the authors\nhave not come close to providing counterexamples to the least-entered rule."}

For this\nreason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio\ndirectly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as\nthe odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an\nobservation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution.\nAdditionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a\ncontinuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of\nthe so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in\nthe Riesz regression procedure in causal inference.

This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

This\nproblem is motivated by last-mile delivery operations, where companies such as\nAmazon rely on gig-economy workers whose availability declines closer to the\noperating day.\n  To address practical limitations of Bayesian models (in particular, to remain\nagnostic to the underlying forecasting method), we study this problem under\nadversarial predictions.

Citizens partially internalize the consequences of\nconcealment by imagining a world in which everyone acted similarly, linking\ntheir compliance decisions to the perceived effectiveness of public spending. A\nselfish elite chooses between public goods and private rents, taking compliance\nas given. In equilibrium, citizens' moral internalization expands the feasible\ntax base and induces elites to allocate resources toward provision rather than\nappropriation. When the value of public spending is uncertain, morality enables\ncredible reform: high-value elites can signal their type through provision,\nprompting citizens to increase compliance and raising fiscal capacity within\nthe same period. The analysis thus identifies a moral channel through which\nstates may escape low-capacity traps even under weak institutions."}

In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a\nset $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t\n\\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,\nincluding extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask\nlearning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is\nwell known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after\n$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal\nacross all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X\n\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log\nd}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log\nd}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of\ncombinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\\log d \\leq m \\leq \\sqrt{d}$--for\nwhich this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by\na factor of exactly $\\sqrt{\\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is\noptimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical\n$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to\nestablish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path\nproblems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial\ndomains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)\nalgorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is\niterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret\nguarantees for DAGs."}

Recent research has indicated that prediction performance\nimprovements in SDP are achievable by applying hyperparameter tuning to a\nparticular SDP scenario.

The main\ndistinctions between the two scenarios lie in the scope of defect prediction\nand the selected evaluation setups.

Recent efforts have seen\nlarge improvements in general code modeling tasks using chain-of-thought style\nreasoning, but these models still fail to comprehend how the environment\ninteracts with code performance. In this paper we propose a methodology to\ntrain language models that can interact with performance tools during their\nreasoning process. We then demonstrate how this methodology can be used to\ntrain a state-of-the-art GPU kernel optimization model."}

To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec,\na two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the\ndenoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by\naligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the\nefficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains\nthe denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing\nthe consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we\ncan smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step\nwith bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces\nAdaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user\npreference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps.\nExtensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively\nmitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both\nefficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders."}

A critical property of\nneural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to\nthe true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins\n(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical\nsystems from measurements.

Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on\nboth in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent\nimprovements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,\nCTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves\nhigher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and\nefficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and\ndeployable PEFT."}

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv requirements", "summary": "The classic exact pattern matching problem, given two strings -- a pattern\n$P$ of length $m$ and a text $T$ of length $n$ -- asks whether $P$ occurs as a\nsubstring of $T$. A property tester for the problem needs to distinguish (with\nhigh probability) the following two cases for some threshold $k$: the YES case,\nwhere $P$ occurs as a substring of $T$, and the NO case, where $P$ has Hamming\ndistance greater than $k$ from every substring of $T$, that is, $P$ has no\n$k$-mismatch occurrence in $T$.\n  In this work, we provide adaptive and non-adaptive property testers for the\nexact pattern matching problem, jointly covering the whole spectrum of\nparameters. We further establish unconditional lower bounds demonstrating that\nthe time and query complexities of our algorithms are optimal, up to\n$\\mathrm{polylog}\\, n$ factors hidden within the $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ notation\nbelow.\n  In the most studied regime of $n=m+\\Theta(m)$, our non-adaptive property\ntester has the time complexity of $\\tilde O(n/\\sqrt{k})$, and a matching lower\nbound remains valid for the query complexity of adaptive algorithms. This\nimproves both upon a folklore solution that attains the optimal query\ncomplexity but requires $\\Omega(n)$ time, and upon the only previously known\nsublinear-time property tester, by Chan, Golan, Kociumaka, Kopelowitz, and\nPorat [STOC 2020], with time complexity $\\tilde O(n/\\sqrt[3]{k})$. The\naforementioned results remain valid for $n=m+\\Omega(m)$, where our optimal\nrunning time $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{nm/k}+n/k)$ improves upon the previously best time\ncomplexity of $\\tilde O(\\sqrt[3]{n^2m/k}+n/k)$. In the regime of $n=m+o(m)$,\nwhich has not been targeted in any previous work, we establish a surprising\nseparation between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, whose optimal time and\nquery complexities are $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{(n-m+1)m/k}+n/k)$ and $\\tilde\nO(\\min(n\\sqrt{n-m+1}/k,\\sqrt{nm/k}+n/k))$, respectively."}

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test.

In this framework, we assume access to a small set of $n$\ngold-standard labeled samples, a much larger set of $N$ unlabeled samples, and\na ML model that can be used to impute the labels of the unlabeled data points.\nWe introduce two new learning-augmented estimators: (1) Prediction-Augmented\nResidual Tree (PART), and (2) Prediction-Augmented Quadrature (PAQ). Both\nestimators have significant advantages over existing estimators like PPI and\nPPI++ introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) and Angelopoulos et al. (2024),\nrespectively. PART is a decision-tree based estimator built using a greedy\ncriterion. We first characterize PART's asymptotic distribution and demonstrate\nhow to construct valid confidence intervals. Then we show that PART outperforms\nexisting methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census\nreports, among other domains. This leads to estimators with higher confidence,\nwhich is the result of using both the gold-standard samples and the machine\nlearning predictions. Finally, we provide a formal proof of the advantage of\nPART by exploring PAQ, an estimation that arises when considering the limit of\nPART when the depth its tree grows to infinity. Under appropriate assumptions\nin the input data we show that the variance of PAQ shrinks at rate of $O(N^{-1}\n+ n^{-4})$, improving significantly on the $O(N^{-1}+n^{-1})$ rate of existing\nmethods."}

For Dyck edit distance, our reduction incurs\nonly polylogarithmic overheads in approximation and update time, yielding an\n$n^{o(1)}$-approximation with $n^{o(1)}$ updates. For tree edit distance, we\nintroduce a new static reduction that improves the best-known approximation\nratio from $n^{3/4}$ to $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ and removes the restriction to\nconstant-degree trees. Extending this reduction dynamically achieves\n$n^{1/2+o(1)}$ approximation with $n^{o(1)}$ update time.\n  A key component is a dynamic maintenance algorithm for history-independent\nheavy-light decompositions, of independent interest. We also provide a novel\nstatic and dynamic decomposition achieving an $O(k \\log n)$-approximation when\nthe tree edit distance is at most $k$. Combined with the trivial bound $k \\le\nn$, this yields a dynamic deterministic $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$-approximation. In\nthe static setting, our algorithm runs in near-linear time; dynamically, it\nrequires only polylogarithmic updates, improving on prior linear-time static\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$-approximation."}

To more\neffectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings\nproduced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive\nMahalanobis Score (CM Score).

Moreover,\nthe interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,\nas biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to\ndevelop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review\nhighlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation\nconsiderations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,\neffective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines\nfor clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience\ndatasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse\nresearch applications is provided."}

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget.

We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly\nreason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization\nconcerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue\nthat realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)\ndeveloping robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to\nguard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine\nLLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics.

This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal\nperception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components\nwhile enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality\ninterference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA\nmatches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced\nmultimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,\ndefective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual\nquestion answering, and action barge-ins.

A key challenge we identify is the\ncontinuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\\\"ive projections of adversarial\nembeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we\nintroduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation\nthrough specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate\nacross four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three\nmath reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token\nlimits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility\nloss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies\ntrying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and\nunderexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning\n(in)efficiency."}

Although various\nself-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these\nmethods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly\ncorrect themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this\nstudy, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and\nfine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction\nmethods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing\ndifferent self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it\nreduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited\noptimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.\nInterestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline\ndemonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the\npotential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while\nhighlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency.

However, when using model\nparallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared\nto coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and\nscatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This\nadditional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to\nAdam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic\nOrthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to\nmatrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization\nto maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning\nrate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this\nalgorithm.

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test.

In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications.

While\nreal-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior\nwork has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,\nprimarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby\noverlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce\nthe first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential\ndisentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time\nseries. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model\ndevelopment, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We\nadditionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align\nlatent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model\nthat achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language\nModels can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement\nevaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.\nTogether, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for\nadvancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement."}

The paper was awarded an honorable mention (best\n  4 papers)", "summary": "The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,\nreferred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying\non a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically\nhindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one\nof the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,\nhindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal\nimprovements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the\nModality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint\nfusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in\nmodality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively\nbalance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during\ntraining to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal\nmodel, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal\npredictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion\ntasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nresults show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion\nmethods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during\ntraining. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality\nencoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent\nmodalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal\nlearning on improving model performance."}

Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models\n(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular\ndata into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful\ncounterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It\nwas found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the\nbiomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also\nconducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection\ntechniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary\ndeterminants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that\nhealth condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study\ndemonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly\ncontribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human\nbehavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals\nworking to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being."}

We represent a model's pre-training parametric\nknowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as\nquerying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we\ncharacterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the\nmodel to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key\nresult shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices\nis disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is\ninefficient and requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once\nthe density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant\ncomponent, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries."}

To illustrate this\nclaim, we conduct case studies with non-adopters and show: how non-adopter\nneeds diverge from those of current users, how non-adopter needs point us\ntowards novel reasoning tasks, and how to systematically integrate non-adopter\nneeds via human-centered methods."}

Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,\ntask-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and\nlimited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework\nfor video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically\ncombining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine\nlearning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video\nunderstanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a\nhigh-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms\na video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual\nencoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal\nSegmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the\ncontinuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.\nThese segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to\nidentify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By\nselecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging\nthe VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework\nautomatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.\nThis approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway\nfor zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content."}

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale\natmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which\nexhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to\nobtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al.

More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex\nrelationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while\nmaintaining physical consistency.

The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations.

However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions.

However, existing methods\nmainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality\nentanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to\ncontinuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive\nanalysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic\ndrift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks;\n2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be\nconfused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework\nis designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic\ndrift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select\nsamples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence\nconfusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed,\nallowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable\nclasses during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual\nincremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method.

Predictions about demand arrive over time and become\nincreasingly accurate, while worker availability decreases. This creates a\nfundamental trade-off between hiring early to avoid understaffing (when workers\nare more available but forecasts are less reliable) and hiring late to avoid\noverstaffing (when forecasts are more accurate but availability is lower). This\nproblem is motivated by last-mile delivery operations, where companies such as\nAmazon rely on gig-economy workers whose availability declines closer to the\noperating day.\n  To address practical limitations of Bayesian models (in particular, to remain\nagnostic to the underlying forecasting method), we study this problem under\nadversarial predictions. In this model, sequential predictions are\nadversarially chosen uncertainty intervals that (approximately) contain the\ntrue demand. The objective is to minimize worst-case staffing imbalance cost.\nOur main result is a simple and computationally efficient online algorithm that\nis minimax optimal. We first characterize the minimax cost against a restricted\nadversary via a polynomial-size linear program, then show how to emulate this\nsolution in the general case. While our base model focuses on a single demand,\nwe extend the framework to multiple demands (with egalitarian/utilitarian\nobjectives), to settings with costly reversals of hiring decisions, and to\ninconsistent prediction intervals. We also introduce a practical \"re-solving\"\nvariant of our algorithm, which we prove is also minimax optimal. Finally we\nconduct numerical experiments showing that our algorithms outperform Bayesian\nheuristics in both cost and speed, and are competitive with (approximate or\nexact) Bayesian-optimal policies when those can be computed."}

A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into\nper-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs\nand progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight,\narchitecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under\nthe official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves\ncross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with\nthe largest gains on unseen-device splits."}

On\nthe other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on\nempirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted\nintervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis."}
