### [1] [Rule Encoding and Compliance in Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05106)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对系统提示中的规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为进行信息论分析，揭示规则格式与注意力熵的关系，建立指针保真度界限，证明热加载验证规则集可增加合规输出概率，强调原则性锚点设计和双重执行机制的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键代理仅靠简单提示工程不够，需分析系统提示中规则编码对注意力机制和合规行为的影响。

Method: 对多种注意力架构进行形式分析，结合动态规则验证架构。

Result: 低句法熵和高度集中锚点的规则格式可降低注意力熵、提高指针保真度，揭示锚点冗余和注意力熵的权衡关系，建立指针保真度界限，证明热加载验证规则集可增加合规输出的渐近概率。

Conclusion: 需要有原则的锚点设计和双重执行机制，以保护基于大语言模型的代理免受提示注入攻击并在不断变化的领域中保持合规。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

### [2] [Structured Cognition for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents: Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍结构化认知循环（SCL）架构，评估其在多场景中表现，结果显示有稳定提升，表明架构分离可提高可靠性和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型作为自主代理处理多步任务时架构存在问题，如推理、记忆和控制在单提示中混合，降低连贯性和可预测性。

Method: 引入SCL架构，将推理、记忆和控制功能分离，在三个场景中与基于提示的基线模型对比评估。

Result: SCL在360次测试中表现出稳定提升，任务成功率达86.3%，目标保真度更高，冗余调用更少等。

Conclusion: 架构分离能在不依赖更大模型或更复杂提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性，研究结果为后续扩展研究提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

### [3] [Optimization Modeling via Semantic Anchored Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05115)
*Yansen Zhang,Qingcan Kang,Yujie Chen,Yufei Wang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SAC - Opt框架解决现有优化建模方法语义错误问题，实验证明其提升建模准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的优化建模方法是求解器驱动，存在未检测到的语义错误，会产生逻辑有缺陷的模型。

Method: 提出SAC - Opt反向引导校正框架，在每一步将原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的语义锚点对齐，选择性校正不匹配组件。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上，SAC - Opt平均建模准确率提高7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上最高提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 基于语义锚定的校正对基于大语言模型的优化工作流程很重要，能确保从问题意图到可执行代码的准确转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

### [4] [Structuring Reasoning for Complex Rules Beyond Flat Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05134)
*Zhihao Yang,Ancheng Xu,Jingpeng Li,Liang Yan,Jiehui Zhou,Zhen Qin,Hengyun Chang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Minghuan Tan,Yujun Cai,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出大语言模型处理复杂规则系统有局限，提出DAT框架，该框架分三阶段推理，实证显示其优于传统CoT方法，小模型用DAT也能有好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型处理复杂规则系统时将规则视为非结构化文本，导致推理偏差，现有方法缺乏结构化规则处理的系统方法且易传播错误，需解决这些局限。

Method: 提出动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，将推理机制分为定性分析、证据收集和裁决三个阶段。

Result: DAT在复杂规则任务中始终优于传统CoT方法，小语言模型使用DAT能达到甚至超越大模型的表现。

Conclusion: DAT框架在管理复杂规则系统方面高效且有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

### [5] [An Algorithmic Information-Theoretic Perspective on the Symbol Grounding Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05153)
*Zhangchi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文在算法信息论中重新表述符号基础问题（SGP），提供统一框架，证明意义基础受信息论限制，论证分四阶段，指出意义是系统不断克服自身信息论限制的开放过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为符号基础问题提供一个确定且统一的框架，统一哥德尔（自引用）和无免费午餐（统计）观点。

Method: 将符号系统建模为通用图灵机，把基础定义为信息压缩行为，分四个阶段进行论证。

Result: 证明纯符号系统无法为大多数可能世界建立基础；静态基础系统固有不完整；适应新环境的“基础行为”不可推断；算法学习过程无法理解复杂度超过自身的世界。

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断克服自身信息论限制的开放过程。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

### [6] [Lang-PINN: From Language to Physics-Informed Neural Networks via a Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05158)
*Xin He,Liangliang You,Hongduan Tian,Bo Han,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Lang - PINN系统，可从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的PINN，实验显示其性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建可用的PINN劳动密集且易出错，现有基于大语言模型的方法缺乏端到端视角。

Method: 提出LLM驱动的多智能体系统Lang - PINN，包含PDE、PINN、Code和Feedback四个互补智能体。

Result: Lang - PINN比竞争基线误差更低、更鲁棒，均方误差降低3 - 5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高超50%，时间开销最多降低74%。

Conclusion: Lang - PINN能将非正式任务描述转化为可执行和可验证的PINN代码。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Motivation: 基础模型学习的表示跨架构和模态有相似性，研究其表示潜力。

Result: 基础模型在表示空间常呈现结构规律和语义一致性，适合跨模态迁移和对齐。

Conclusion: 分析了促进表示潜力的关键因素，讨论了开放问题和潜在挑战。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在不牺牲确定性属性的前提下，可靠查询SAT - Graph RAG结构化知识的问题。

Method: 引入SAT - Graph API，以规范动作为核心的形式化查询执行层，利用规划器引导的智能体将复杂查询分解为动作的有向无环图。

Result: 实现高精度混合搜索、鲁棒引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计因果追踪。

Conclusion: 该两层架构将检索从黑盒变为透明可审计过程，满足高风险领域可解释AI要求。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 提出含三层语义层的物联网实时框架，由六层构成，详述各层处理方式，可解决物联网数据管理问题，适用于农业等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在数据收集和理解方面存在挑战，需要框架帮助设备和传感器理解数据含义和来源。

Method: 构建包含感知、语义标注、互操作性、传输、语义推理和应用六层的框架，各层有不同处理方法，如添加元数据、使用语义算法、采用通信技术、运用推理理论等。

Result: 该框架能有效管理物联网数据，确保语义完整性，实现实时知识推理。

Conclusion: 框架结合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作性技术，是推进物联网应用，特别是农业应用的有价值工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

*Wenda Xie,Chao Guo,Yanqing Jing. Junle Wang,Yisheng Lv,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Dramaturge方法解决大语言模型生成高质量长叙事脚本的问题，实验表明该方法优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单遍流程的大语言模型生成高质量长叙事脚本困难，直接修改易引入局部与整体叙事的不一致性。

Method: 提出Dramaturge，采用任务和特征导向的分治法，由全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段组成，采用自上而下任务流和粗到细迭代流程。

Result: Dramaturge在脚本整体质量和场景细节方面显著优于所有基线。

Conclusion: Dramaturge方法是即插即用的，可集成到现有方法中改进生成的脚本。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

TL;DR: 提出基于图的推理框架，结合大语言模型处理公共卫生紧急情况人口数据，实验证明可行，为资源受限场景提供可扩展方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理公共卫生紧急情况中大量半结构化人口数据，专家评估低效，标准NLP管道有局限。

Method: 提出基于图的推理框架，在弱监督管道中结合大语言模型、结构化人口属性和非结构化公众反馈，构建需求感知图。

Result: 用真实数据集测试，初步实验结果证明方法可行。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境下的智能人口健康监测提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复采样会增加前沿AI系统的能力和潜在危害，需要解决如何在小采样预算下准确预测模型大规模尝试时的行为这一问题，该问题对模型提供商和监管者都很重要。

Method: 指出标准拟合方法的统计缺陷，引入基于beta - binomial分布的稳健估计框架，并提出动态采样策略，为更难的问题分配更多预算。

Result: 这些创新能以较低的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决在小采样预算下准确预测模型大规模尝试行为的问题。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架对齐多模态大语言模型，实验显示在不同基准测试中表现提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单信号、基于模型的奖励方法存在缺乏置信度校准、无法捕捉人类偏好多样性、需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练等问题。

Method: 提出混合奖励建模框架，整合基于模型的奖励（从合成和人类反馈预测分数）和基于规则的奖励（领域特定启发式提供带置信度的正确性信号），还引入多方面奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在不同多模态基准测试中持续改进，3B 家族最佳模型在一般和数学推理任务中平均提升约 9.5%，在数学基准测试中平均提升约 16%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习策略优化为对齐多模态大语言模型提供了灵活有效的方法。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有多轮文本到SQL基准不足，提出BIRD - INTERACT基准，含综合交互环境、两种评估设置和任务套件，实证显示其有难度，验证交互重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮文本到SQL基准无法反映生产级数据库助手挑战，真实世界数据库应用多需多轮交互。

Method: 引入BIRD - INTERACT基准，包含综合交互环境、两种评估设置和任务套件。

Result: GPT - 5在c - Interact中只完成8.67%的任务，在a - Interact中完成17.00%的任务。

Conclusion: 有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务很重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

TL;DR: 介绍生物医学领域透明、基于代理的推理和证据整合演示系统M - Reason，展示其优势和潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学领域，尤其是癌症研究中，实现透明的推理和证据整合，提高证据合成效率和输出一致性。

Method: 利用大语言模型和模块化代理编排，各代理负责特定证据流，并行处理和细粒度分析，强调可解释性等，还讨论权衡并集成确定性代码，提供开放交互界面。

Result: 评估显示在效率和输出一致性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: M - Reason有潜力成为证据合成实用工具和科学研究中多代理大语言模型系统的测试平台。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估贝叶斯方法在MPC中的应用效果，解决当前应用中性能和鲁棒性增益报告零散的问题。

Method: 系统分析相关研究及其实际应用情况。

Result: 贝叶斯方法虽在MPC中用于捕捉和传播不确定性，但性能和鲁棒性增益报告零散，基线不一致且可靠性分析有限。

Conclusion: 需要标准化基准、消融研究和透明报告来严格确定贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

TL;DR: 研究用软提示表示示例来适配基础模型，提出MHA - RAG框架，在多基准测试中表现优，性能提升且降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用特定领域示例作为上下文演示来适配基础模型的方法，研究单纯以文本表示示例是否是最有效、高效和稳定的方法。

Method: 引入MHA - RAG框架，用注意力头数量作为超参数控制不同任务的软提示生成。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和不同模型规模中，MHA - RAG比标准RAG性能提升20点，推理成本降低10倍GFLOPs。

Conclusion: MHA - RAG在适配基础模型时，能实现更高准确性和效率，且不受示例顺序影响。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Motivation: 有意义的人机协作需深入理解符号及社会构建的意义，而当前AI系统常缺失对话中的动态解读。

Method: 借鉴符号互动论开展两项研究。

Result: 参与者会根据对话式AI建议改变意义定义，会将个人和社会价值观投射于交互中并随时间完善意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解并非源于简单认同，而是符号双向交换与重新诠释，为人机交互设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

### [19] [Teacher-Student Guided Inverse Modeling for Steel Final Hardness Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05402)
*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用师生学习框架解决钢材热处理硬度预测逆问题，在公开数据集验证其高效准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢材热处理硬度预测因多对一特性致逆问题困难，需有效解决方案。

Method: 先训练前向模型（教师）预测最终硬度，再训练反向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，学生通过教师反馈迭代优化。

Result: 师生框架逆预测精度更高，计算时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 师生学习框架对材料科学逆过程建模有效且高效。

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Result: AI模型呈现出类似人类的过度自信模式，能力较弱和使用稀有编程语言的模型有更强的类似邓宁 - 克鲁格效应的偏差。

Conclusion: 模型邓宁 - 克鲁格效应的偏差强度与能力成比例。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: 介绍AInstein框架测试大语言模型仅用预训练知识解决AI研究问题的能力，结果显示其有一定能力但问题解决能力脆弱且对表述敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在广泛任务上的成功是源于真正推理还是复杂记忆，测试其仅用预训练知识解决AI研究问题的能力。

Method: 从ICLR 2025高质量投稿中提取问题，用专门求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和完善解决方案，用LLM作为评判并结合人工检查，用成功率、重现性和新颖性三个指标评估。

Result: 大语言模型能重现可行方案并偶尔提出创新方案，但问题解决能力脆弱且对表述高度敏感。

Conclusion: 首次大规模证明大语言模型作为自主科学问题解决者的潜力和当前局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

TL;DR: 软件漏洞数量激增，现有基于大语言模型的自动漏洞修复方法存在缺乏高质量漏洞推理数据和难验证中间修复过程的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞数量指数级增长，急需自动漏洞修复（AVR）解决方案。

Method: 将AVR表述为序列生成问题，利用大语言模型直接生成漏洞修复方案，或进行提示、微调。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 现有基于大语言模型的AVR方法面临缺乏高质量漏洞推理数据和难验证中间修复过程的挑战。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

TL;DR: 提出混合神经符号框架结合ASP与基于变压器的学习用于航空安全报告系统语料库的多标签文本分类，提升性能并减少规则违反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度变压器模型在多标签文本分类中常违反领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中是重要问题，需要解决。

Method: 提出混合神经符号框架，将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过基于规则的数据增强和模糊逻辑正则化两种方式融入规则，调整每类阈值并报告相关指标。

Result: 与BCE基线相比，提高了微观和宏观F1分数，在ASRS测试集上规则违反最多减少86%。

Conclusion: 此为首次将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动的增强和可微变压器训练统一用于ASRS报告的大规模神经符号应用，可实现可信的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多检查规则合规性，无法揭示模型在有争议现实问题上是否坚持连贯价值体系，需评估大语言模型输出是否反映一致人类价值观。

Method: 引入VAL - Bench，包含11.5万对来自维基百科争议部分的对立问题提示对，使用大语言模型作为评判者对模型对提示对的响应一致性打分。

Result: 对主流开源和闭源模型评估，揭示了对齐程度的巨大差异，突出了安全策略和更具表达性的价值体系之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL - Bench提供了可扩展、可重复的基准，能系统比较大语言模型体现人类价值观的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Motivation: 现有Vision - Language - Action (VLA)模型在具身推理中需特定任务微调，对未见任务泛化能力差。

Method: 提出MetaVLA框架，引入Context - Aware Meta Co - Training，整合目标任务，利用辅助任务提高泛化能力，集成轻量级元学习机制。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，带六个辅助任务的MetaVLA在长周期任务上比OpenVLA高8.0%，减少训练步骤，削减GPU时间。

Conclusion: 可实现可扩展、低资源的后训练，为通用具身智能体发展提供方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

Motivation: 现有结果驱动强化学习工具增强方法扩展性和泛化性差，大多数智能体系统免训练或离线训练，与多轮交互实时动态解耦。

Method: 引入AgentFlow框架，协调四个模块，通过不断更新的内存进行交互；提出Flow - GRPO算法，将多轮优化转换为单轮策略更新。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索、智能体、数学和科学任务上平均准确率优于基线模型，甚至超过GPT - 4o。

Conclusion: 在流程内优化有诸多好处，如改进规划、提高工具调用可靠性，且随模型大小和推理轮数呈正相关。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

Result: 测试集标签自动提取正确率98.6%，基于标签的模型训练表现有竞争力，模型在外部数据集泛化性好，不同标注策略和数据集无显著差异。

Conclusion: GPT - 4o能从放射报告提取标签训练高精度多标签分类模型，报告中的不确定性不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Motivation: 大语言模型有大量文本数据，具身AI受物理轨迹收集成本限制，桌面环境特别是游戏可提供丰富传感运动交互，作为具身学习的替代方案。

Method: 框架包含OWA Toolkit统一桌面交互格式、Generalist - IDM实现跨游戏零样本泛化和伪标签生成、VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理操作和导航。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感运动原语可有效迁移到物理具身任务，桌面预训练是机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Motivation: 设计多无人机数据收集调度和飞行速度是灾后监测场景的挑战，在线DRL方案不适用于海啸监测，LLM虽有潜力但有输入数据限制

Method: 提出联合优化数据收集调度和速度控制方案，考虑地面传感器电池电量、队列长度、信道条件和无人机轨迹，采用基于注意力的上下文学习方法AIC - VDS

Result: 模拟结果表明AIC - VDS优于Deep - Q - Network (DQN)和最大信道增益基线

Conclusion: AIC - VDS可作为应急场景中替代DRL的方案，有效减少数据丢失

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统自动设计技术表现差、计算成本高且需大量数据标注，思维链推理表现有竞争力，值得深入研究。

Method: 引入代理推理模块（ARM），通过代码空间树搜索发现，从简单思维链模块开始，根据执行轨迹反思进行变异。ARM可直接递归使用或作为子程序。

Result: 显著优于手动设计和现有自动设计方法，构建的多智能体系统泛化性出色。

Conclusion: 聚焦优化思维链推理的新范式有效，ARM是有潜力的推理构建块。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Conclusion: 该方法可用于大气传输模型，支持温室气体反演系统，未来可探索LPDM系统误差。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Conclusion: 为全扩散级联数据不可用场景建立了早期热度预测的可靠、可解释且实用的基准，贡献了新的跨语言数据集和热度定义方法，首次结合时间序列数据与静态内容和网络特征预测早期模因热度。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Result: RareAgent比推理基线提高了18.1%的指示AUPRC，并提供与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: RareAgent在罕见病药物重定位任务中表现良好，能有效提升性能并提供透明推理。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是高效创建推理数据集的有力信号，可用于监督成本高的领域。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

Result: 在三个模型规模和多个数据集上，说服优化策略使训练测试泛化差距最多缩小13.94%，测试性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 说服竞争压力比协作求真更能培养可迁移推理技能，为提升LLM泛化能力提供新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可将大语言模型转变为无需参数训练、有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类求解器。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine

Conclusion: 提出的动态反事实基准可揭示过拟合和测量真实推理能力，现有模型数学推理存在不足。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Result: ARISE能可靠细粒度测量测试时缩放能力，不同模型缩放效率有显著差异，Claude Opus缩放特性更优。

Conclusion: ARISE是评估大推理模型测试时缩放有效性的可靠指标。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

Result: 发现拒绝悬崖现象，消融3%的注意力头可降低攻击成功率，新方法用1.7%的原始安全训练数据实现可比的安全提升。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非本质不安全，而是拒绝意图被系统抑制，新的数据选择方法在安全对齐中有少即是多的效果。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型对所有步骤进行扩展推理存在大量冗余，需让推理模型能自适应不同难度步骤。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，对困难步骤详细推理，简单步骤简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH - 500和AIME上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短推理长度，大幅提高效率且不影响准确率。

Conclusion: MixReasoning框架是有效的，可动态调整推理深度以提高推理模型效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手代理存在局限，纯算法进化在复杂领域易停滞，纯深度研究提出的方案缺乏验证。

Method: 提出DeepEvolve，将外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试整合在反馈驱动的迭代循环中。

Result: 在化学、数学等九个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，生成可执行的新算法。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve弥合了无指导进化和无根据研究之间的差距，为科学算法发现提供可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有可观测性数据集因专有性限制在公共基准中代表性不足，且现有数据集处理后限制了其在预测外任务的应用。

Method: 引入来自5G电信网络的TelecomTS数据集，并对现有时间序列、语言和推理模型进行基准测试。

Result: 现有方法难以处理可观测性数据的突变、噪声和高方差动态，保留协变量绝对尺度很重要。

Conclusion: 实际可观测性应用需要原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

Motivation: 经典路由算法适应性差，基于LLM的方法存在空间推理和联合建模问题，需解决这些局限。

Method: 提出RouteLLM分层多智能体框架，解析用户查询，通过管理智能体协调多个子智能体处理约束、POI和路径，最后验证智能体确保约束满足。

Result: 方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为考虑约束的路线，相比经典方法提升了路线质量和偏好满足度。

Conclusion: RouteLLM框架有效结合了语言灵活性和空间结构，能对路线可行性和用户偏好进行推理。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在竞争环境中广泛应用，但竞争反馈循环对其行为的影响尚不明确，因此研究优化大语言模型追求竞争成功的影响。

Method: 在不同场景的模拟环境中进行研究。

Result: 在不同场景中，追求竞争成功（如增加销售、选票、社交媒体参与度）会伴随欺骗营销、虚假信息、有害行为宣传等问题的增加。

Conclusion: 市场驱动的优化压力会系统性侵蚀模型对齐，安全部署AI系统需要更强治理和精心设计的激励机制以防止竞争破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

Conclusion: 结合顺序和并行TTS策略，利用非对称验证能有效提升深度搜索代理性能，开源模型经TTS扩展后可媲美甚至超越专有模型。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Conclusion: AI在算法设计中起核心作用，人类研究人员将更专注于问题表述和战略指导，需适应AI时代的系统研究实践。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Motivation: 提出一种新的、可用于制造的拓扑优化框架，避免后处理步骤。

Method: 将显式高斯描述与类似水平集的Heaviside投影相结合，用各向异性高斯函数叠加表示设计几何。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，优化设计达到与经典MMC方法相当的目标值，边界更精细；具有网格独立性、强几何表达能力等优势。

Abstract: We introduce the Gaussian Ensemble Topology (GET) method, a new explicit and
manufacture-ready framework for topology optimization in which design
geometries are represented as superpositions of anisotropic Gaussian functions.
By combining explicit Gaussian descriptions with a level-set-like Heaviside
projection, GET inherently generates smooth, curvature-continuous designs
without requiring post-processing steps such as mesh or corner smoothing and
feature extraction. The method is validated on standard compliance-minimization
and compliant mechanism benchmarks in two and three dimensions. The optimized
designs achieve objective values comparable to those obtained with classical
Moving Morphable Component (MMC) approaches, but with geometrically consistent,
refined boundaries. Numerical examples demonstrate additional advantages of the
GET framework, including mesh independence inherent to explicit
parameterizations, strong geometric expressiveness, and effective control over
smoothness, discreteness, and structural complexity through parameter tuning.
As a robust and manufacture-ready approach to explicit topology optimization,

TL;DR: 提出PhysicoGPTCR模型用于生成TCR序列，在多个基准测试中表现良好，可加速功能性TCR候选物设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在设计T细胞受体可变区时无法同时保证新颖性、多样性和生物物理合理性，需要新方法加速计算机辅助细胞治疗。

Method: 提出PhysicoGPTCR模型，以肽和HLA为双重条件，嵌入残基水平的物理化学描述符，通过最大似然目标优化模型，并与多个基线模型对比。

Result: 在多个新抗原基准测试中，PhysicoGPTCR在编辑距离、相似度和最长公共子序列得分上有显著提升，占据更广泛的序列空间，结合能力强的克隆比例更高。

Conclusion: 双重条件、基于物理的生成模型能够实现功能性TCR候选物的端到端设计，缩短发现时间且不牺牲湿实验可验证性。

Abstract: Physicochemically informed biological sequence generation has the potential
to accelerate computer-aided cellular therapy, yet current models fail to
\emph{jointly} ensure novelty, diversity, and biophysical plausibility when
designing variable regions of T-cell receptors (TCRs). We present
\textbf{PhysicoGPTCR}, a large generative protein Transformer that is
\emph{dual-conditioned} on peptide and HLA context and trained to
autoregressively synthesise TCR sequences while embedding residue-level
physicochemical descriptors. The model is optimised on curated
TCR--peptide--HLA triples with a maximum-likelihood objective and compared
against ANN, GPTCR, LSTM, and VAE baselines. Across multiple neoantigen
benchmarks, PhysicoGPTCR substantially improves edit-distance, similarity, and
longest-common-subsequence scores, while populating a broader region of
sequence space. Blind in-silico docking and structural modelling further reveal
a higher proportion of binding-competent clones than the strongest baseline,
validating the benefit of explicit context conditioning and physicochemical
awareness. Experimental results demonstrate that dual-conditioned,
physics-grounded generative modelling enables end-to-end design of functional
TCR candidates, reducing the discovery timeline from months to minutes without
sacrificing wet-lab verifiability.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of detecting code smells in large-scale
software systems using machine learning (ML). Traditional detection methods
often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalization across different
datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a machine learning-based model
that automatically and accurately identifies code smells, offering a scalable
solution for software quality analysis. The novelty of our approach lies in the
use of eight diverse ML algorithms, including XGBoost, AdaBoost, and other
classifiers, alongside key techniques such as the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for class imbalance and Pearson correlation for
efficient feature selection. These methods collectively improve model accuracy
and generalization. Our methodology involves several steps: first, we
preprocess the data and apply SMOTE to balance the dataset; next, Pearson
correlation is used for feature selection to reduce redundancy; followed by
training eight ML algorithms and tuning hyperparameters through Grid Search,
Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Finally, we evaluate the models using
accuracy, F-measure, and confusion matrices. The results show that AdaBoost,
Random Forest, and XGBoost perform best, achieving accuracies of 100%, 99%, and
99%, respectively. This study provides a robust framework for detecting code
smells, enhancing software quality assurance, and demonstrating the
effectiveness of a comprehensive, optimized ML approach.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning nonlinear
mappings between function spaces, enabling real-time prediction of complex
dynamics in diverse scientific and engineering applications. With their growing
adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator
architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model
selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive
comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D
industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear
elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and
computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs
and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse
neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic
comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including
Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural
Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators
inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired
by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models
to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison.
Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms
of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and
deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future
neural operator development.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出基于机器学习的SQL查询运行时间预测框架，用执行计划特征训练模型，实验表明XGBoost模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成本模型在复杂多变工作负载下难以反映实际查询性能，需探索新方法。

Method: 集成执行计划的标量和结构特征以及SQL查询语义表示训练预测模型，构建数据收集和特征提取自动化管道，比较多种回归模型。

Result: XGBoost模型显著优于其他模型，均方误差0.3002，超65%情况预测准确率在真实运行时间10%以内。

Conclusion: 基于树的学习结合执行计划特征可提升查询优化器成本估算能力。

Abstract: Accurate query runtime prediction is a critical component of effective query
optimization in modern database systems. Traditional cost models, such as those
used in PostgreSQL, rely on static heuristics that often fail to reflect actual
query performance under complex and evolving workloads. This remains an active
area of research, with recent work exploring machine learning techniques to
replace or augment traditional cost estimators. In this paper, we present a
machine learning-based framework for predicting SQL query runtimes using
execution plan features extracted from PostgreSQL. Our approach integrates
scalar and structural features from execution plans and semantic
representations of SQL queries to train predictive models. We construct an
automated pipeline for data collection and feature extraction using
parameterized TPC-H queries, enabling systematic evaluation of multiple
modeling techniques. Unlike prior efforts that focus either on cardinality
estimation or on synthetic cost metrics, we model the actual runtimes using
fine-grained plan statistics and query embeddings derived from execution
traces, to improve the model accuracy. We compare baseline regressors, a
refined XGBoost model, and a sequential LSTM-based model to assess their
effectiveness in runtime prediction. Our dataset includes over 1000 queries
generated from TPC-H query templates executed in PostgreSQL with EXPLAIN
ANALYZE. Experimental results show that the XGBoost model significantly
outperforms others, achieving a mean squared error of 0.3002 and prediction
accuracy within 10% of the true runtime in over 65% of cases. The findings
highlight the potential of tree-based learning combined with execution plan
features for improving cost estimation in query optimizers.

Result: 定量评估研究非相关谓词选择性的影响，定性评估对比现有方法找出局限性，实验表明合适条件下性能提升5倍。

Conclusion: 该新技术在合适条件下能有效提升处理相关子查询的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a novel technique for processing correlated
subqueries in SQL. The core idea is to isolate the non-correlated part of the
predicate and use it to reduce the number of evaluations of the correlated
part. We begin by providing an overview of several classes of queries that may
benefit from this technique. For each class, we propose a potential rewrite and
discuss the conditions under which it is advantageous. Next, we address the
evaluation aspects of the proposed rewrites: 1) we describe our approach to
adapting the block-based Volcano query processing model, and 2) we discuss the
benefits of implementing that technique within a position-enabled column-store
with late materialization support. Finally, we present a simple cost model that
allows estimation of the benefits of said rewrites.
  Our evaluation has a quantitative part and a qualitative part. The former
focuses on studying the impact of non-correlated predicate selectivity on our
technique. The latter identifies the limitations of our approach by comparing
it with alternative approaches available in existing systems. Overall,
experiments conducted using PosDB (a position-enabled column-store) and
PostgreSQL demonstrated that, under suitable conditions, our technique can
achieve a 5x improvement.

TL;DR: 提出NANOMIND框架，将大模型拆分为模块并映射到理想加速器，在资源受限下实现高吞吐量和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型推理方式未充分利用异构加速器，导致高延迟。

Method: 将大模型拆分为模块化组件，在统一内存SoC上进行模块级动态卸载，结合定制硬件设计、系统调度和优化低比特计算内核。

Result: 系统在资源效率上优于现有实现，能耗降低42.3%，GPU内存使用降低11.2%，电池设备运行模型时间大幅增加。

Conclusion: NANOMIND框架有效提升大模型推理的资源效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision
and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost
always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous
accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end
latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design
inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models
into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its
ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into
modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.
It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on
unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level
scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our
framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs
entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent
assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher
throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The
design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage
through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system
outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy
consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a
battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a
day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

Motivation: 现代GPU浮点运算能力和内存带宽发展不一致，现行按时间定价模式未考虑内存带宽边际成本上升，导致市场扭曲和硬件分配不佳。

Method: 提出基于特征的定价框架，给出经济和算法定义，实现Agora系统架构。

Result: 50us采样接近理想采样定价，仅损失5%收入；10us采样损失2.4%；原型实现表明基于特征定价系统可构建。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同GPU应用和硬件世代中有效，能使云GPU资源市场更透明高效。

Abstract: The historic trend of Moore's Law, which predicted exponential growth in
computational performance per dollar, has diverged for modern Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs). While Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs)
capabilities have continued to scale economically, memory bandwidth has not,
creating a significant price-performance disconnect. This paper argues that the
prevailing time-based pricing models for cloud GPUs are economically
inefficient for bandwidth-bound workloads. These models fail to account for the
rising marginal cost of memory bandwidth, leading to market distortions and
suboptimal hardware allocation. To address this, we propose a novel
feature-based pricing framework that directly links cost to resource
consumption, including but not limited to memory bandwidth. We provide a robust
economic and algorithmic definition of this framework and introduce Agora, a
practical and secure system architecture for its implementation. Our
implementation of Agora shows that a 50us sampling provides nearly perfect
pricing as what ideal sampling would provide - losing only 5\% of revenue. 10us
sampling is even better result in 2.4\% loss. Modern telemetry systems can
already provide this rate of measurement, and our prototype implementation
shows the system design for feature-based pricing is buildable. Our evaluation
across diverse GPU applications and hardware generations empirically validates
the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more transparent and efficient
market for cloud GPU resources.

Conclusion: FlexPipe具有更高的生产力、可编程性、可调试性和易于调优的特点，能有效提升管道并行性能。

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism is an essential distributed parallelism method.
Increasingly complex and diverse DNN models necessitate meticulously customized
pipeline schedules for performance. However, existing practices typically rely
on predefined schedules, each with strengths, but fail to adapt automatically
to the emerging model architectures. Exploring novel high-efficiency schedules
is daunting due to the enormous and varying schedule space. Besides, manually
implementing schedules can be challenging due to the onerous coding burdens and
constantly changing needs. Unfortunately, existing frameworks have limitations
in automated schedule exploration and lack flexibility and controllability.
  This paper presents FlexPipe, a programmable pipeline parallelism framework
with enhanced productivity, programmability, debuggability, and ease of tuning.
FlexPipe has two main components: a succinct domain-specific language (DSL) and
an automated scheduler. FlexPipe enables automated schedule exploration for
various parallel scenarios within a broad spectrum of schedule types at a small
search cost. Besides, users can swiftly develop and customize schedules using
the FlexPipe DSL, which embodies flexible controllability in the pipeline order
of micro-batch computations over stages. It also provides convenient mechanisms
to include new operations in schedules to meet changing demands. Our evaluation
results demonstrate that FlexPipe achieves up to 2.28X performance speedup
compared to the popular large-scale parallel framework Megtron-LM, and gains up
to 1.49X performance speedup compared to the state-of-the-art automated
pipeline parallelism framework.

Abstract: WebAssembly has emerged as a lightweight and portable runtime to execute
serverless functions, particularly in heterogeneous and resource-constrained
environments such as the Edge Cloud Continuum. However, the performance
benefits versus trade-offs remain insufficiently understood. This paper
presents Lumos, a performance model and benchmarking tool for characterizing
serverless runtimes. Lumos identifies workload, system, and environment-level
performance drivers in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. We benchmark state-of-the-art
containers and the Wasm runtime in interpreted mode and with ahead-of-time
compilation. Our performance characterization shows that AoT-compiled Wasm
images are up to 30x smaller and decrease cold-start latency by up to 16%
compared to containers, while interpreted Wasm suffers up to 55x higher warm
latency and up to 10x I/O-serialization overhead.

Abstract: Efficient resource allocation is a key challenge in modern cloud computing.
Over-provisioning leads to unnecessary costs, while under-provisioning risks
performance degradation and SLA violations. This work presents an artificial
intelligence approach to predict resource utilization in big data pipelines
using Random Forest regression. We preprocess the Google Borg cluster traces to
clean, transform, and extract relevant features (CPU, memory, usage
distributions). The model achieves high predictive accuracy (R Square = 0.99,
MAE = 0.0048, RMSE = 0.137), capturing non-linear relationships between
workload characteristics and resource utilization. Error analysis reveals
impressive performance on small-to-medium jobs, with higher variance in rare
large-scale jobs. These results demonstrate the potential of AI-driven
prediction for cost-aware autoscaling in cloud environments, reducing
unnecessary provisioning while safeguarding service quality.

Abstract: Deep research agents, which synthesize information across diverse sources,
are significantly constrained by their sequential reasoning processes. This
architectural bottleneck results in high latency, poor runtime adaptability,
and inefficient resource allocation, making them impractical for interactive
applications. To overcome this, we introduce FlashResearch, a novel framework
for efficient deep research that transforms sequential processing into
parallel, runtime orchestration by dynamically decomposing complex queries into
tree-structured sub-tasks. Our core contributions are threefold: (1) an
adaptive planner that dynamically allocates computational resources by
determining research breadth and depth based on query complexity; (2) a
real-time orchestration layer that monitors research progress and prunes
redundant paths to reallocate resources and optimize efficiency; and (3) a
multi-dimensional parallelization framework that enables concurrency across
both research breadth and depth. Experiments show that FlashResearch
consistently improves final report quality within fixed time budgets, and can
deliver up to a 5x speedup while maintaining comparable quality.

Result: 在三个小语言模型和六个数据集实验，SATER性能相当，计算成本降超50%，级联延迟降超80%。

Conclusion: SATER能有效减少冗余输出和响应时间，提升预生成路由性能和级联路由效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their effectiveness frequently depends on costly commercial
APIs or cloud services. Model selection thus entails a critical trade-off
between performance and cost: high-performing LLMs typically incur substantial
expenses, whereas budget-friendly small language models (SLMs) are constrained
by limited capabilities. Current research primarily proposes two routing
strategies: pre-generation routing and cascade routing. Both approaches have
distinct characteristics, with cascade routing typically offering superior
cost-effectiveness and accuracy despite its higher latency. To further address
the limitations of both approaches, we introduce SATER, a dual-mode compatible
approach that fine-tunes models through shortest-response preference
optimization and a confidence-aware rejection mechanism. SATER significantly
reduces redundant outputs and response times, while improving both the
performance of pre-generation routing and the efficiency of cascade routing.
Experiments across three SLMs and six datasets, varying in type and complexity,
demonstrate that SATER achieves comparable performance while consistently
reducing computational costs by over 50\% and cascade latency by over 80\%.

Result: TLP随闭市时长和波动性增加而增长，但可通过自适应LTV控制。

Conclusion: 时间绑定稳定币可减少时间上的市场低效，为后续研究和部署提供参考。

Abstract: Time-bound stablecoins are DeFi assets that temporarily tokenize traditional
securities during market off-hours, enabling continuous cross-market liquidity.
We introduce the Liquidity-of-Time Premium (TLP): the extra return or cost of
providing liquidity when the primary market is closed. We build a no-arbitrage
pricing model that yields a band for fair values over different expiries, and a
dynamic risk-control mechanism that adjusts loan-to-value (LTV) ratios in real
time to keep TLP within a target range. Our analysis blends financial
engineering (no-arbitrage conditions, option-style pricing) with empirical
finance (event studies on cross-listed stocks and futures) to measure TLP under
time-zone frictions. We define TLP formally, derive closed-form expressions for
its term structure under idealized assumptions, and simulate scenarios that
vary volatility and collateralization. We then propose an LTV policy that
raises or lowers collateral to expand or curtail time-bound stablecoin supply,
analogous to a central bank adjusting rates to defend a peg. We outline
empirical proxies for TLP, including ADR premiums, overseas index futures
versus cash index divergence, and pre-market versus official close gaps.
Results show that TLP grows with closure length and volatility, yet can be
contained by adaptive LTV. We provide backtests and figures (term-structure
curves, capital-efficiency versus tail-risk trade-offs, time-liquidity
heatmaps) and discuss protocol design (vault structure, closing-price oracles,
on-chain auction liquidations). The findings position time-bound stablecoins as
a tool to reduce temporal market inefficiencies and inform future research and
deployment.

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能持续提升吞吐量和内存利用率，在相同每设备内存限制下，最多可减少50%的管道空闲时间，在某些情况下可在有限内存预算内训练更大模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决现有管道并行调度问题，可动态优化内存和时间的权衡。

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism (PP) has become a standard technique for scaling large
language model (LLM) training across multiple devices. However, despite recent
progress in reducing memory consumption through activation offloading, existing
approaches remain largely heuristic and coarse-grained, often overlooking the
fine-grained trade-offs between memory, computation, and scheduling latency. In
this work, we revisit the pipeline scheduling problem from a principled
optimization perspective. We observe that prevailing strategies either rely on
static rules or aggressively offload activations without fully leveraging the
interaction between memory constraints and scheduling efficiency. To address
this, we formulate scheduling as a constrained optimization problem that
jointly accounts for memory capacity, activation reuse, and pipeline bubble
minimization. Solving this model yields fine-grained schedules that reduce
pipeline bubbles while adhering to strict memory budgets. Our approach
complements existing offloading techniques: whereas prior approaches trade
memory for time in a fixed pattern, we dynamically optimize the tradeoff with
respect to model structure and hardware configuration. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method consistently improves both throughput and memory
utilization. In particular, we reduce idle pipeline time by up to 50% under the
same per-device memory limit, and in some cases, enable the training of larger
models within limited memory budgets.

Motivation: 探讨现代数值格式在现代高性能计算架构上求解流体动力学问题的性能。

Method: 实现空间节点间断Galerkin格式，与龙格 - 库塔方法时间耦合，使用Kokkos库和消息传递接口，在不同GPU系统运行单源代码。

Result: 高阶代码更快；RK方案对性能影响小，经典四阶方案是不错选择；代码在GPU和CPU上表现好；小网格CPU快，大网格GPU快；大网格GPU能耗低，小网格CPU能耗低；新GPU需更大网格才能高效使用。

Conclusion: 现代数值格式在高性能计算架构上有良好表现，但不同硬件在不同场景有优势，新GPU使用存在反弹效应。

Abstract: This work discusses the performance of a modern numerical scheme for fluid
dynamical problems on modern high-performance computing architectures. Our code
implements a spatial nodal discontinuous Galerkin scheme that we test up to an
order of convergence of eight. It is temporally coupled to a set of Runge-Kutta
methods of orders up to six. The code integrates the linear advection equations
as well as the isothermal Euler equations in one, two, and three dimensions. In
order to target modern hardware involving many-core Central Processing Units
and accelerators such as Graphic Processing Units we use the Kokkos library in
conjunction with the Message Passing Interface to run our single source code on
various GPU systems. We find that the higher the order the faster is the code.
Eighth-order simulations attain a given global error with much less computing
time than third- or fourth-order simulations. The RK scheme has a smaller
impact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to
generally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs.
The many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed
up to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size
simulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over
CPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\approx
3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical
simulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large
grid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency
that the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use
it efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need
longer computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the
energy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs.

TL;DR: 提出cMPI利用CXL内存共享优化MPI点对点通信，性能优于传统网络协议


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPI库使用复杂网络协议进行跨节点通信，有优化需求

Method: 在真实CXL平台上利用CXL内存共享，将跨节点通信转化为内存事务和数据拷贝，绕过传统网络协议

Result: CXL内存共享比基于TCP的互连延迟低7.2 - 8.1倍，cMPI在小消息的延迟和带宽上分别比标准以太网NIC和高端SmartNIC上的TCP最多高49倍和72倍

Conclusion: cMPI在MPI点对点通信优化上表现出色，能显著提升性能

Abstract: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for
high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network
interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP
and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present
cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both
one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform,
transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies
within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze
performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing
achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in
small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing
for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax
representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI
outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x
and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures
achieve remarkable performance improvements, but their random expert selection
mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the
dominant bottleneck in multi-unit serving systems. To forecast the patterns
underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric

Motivation: 解决大语言模型驱动的代理自主探索时系统支持不足的问题，现有机制无法满足需求。

Method: 对六种快照/恢复机制进行基准测试。

Result: 通用工具如CRIU或容器提交即使在隔离测试环境中速度也不够快，在真实部署中完全失效。

Conclusion: 明确了三个开放的基础挑战，即分叉语义、外部副作用和原生分叉。

Abstract: Agentic exploration, letting LLM-powered agents branch, backtrack, and search
across many execution paths, demands systems support well beyond today's
pass-at-k resets. Our benchmark of six snapshot/restore mechanisms shows that
generic tools such as CRIU or container commits are not fast enough even in
isolated testbeds, and they crumble entirely in real deployments where agents
share files, sockets, and cloud APIs with other agents and human users. In this
talk, we pinpoint three open fundamental challenges: fork semantics, which
concerns how branches reveal or hide tentative updates; external side-effects,
where fork awareness must be added to services or their calls intercepted; and
native forking, which requires cloning databases and runtimes in microseconds
without bulk copying.

Motivation: 分布式多智能体系统中正确性与操作策略纠缠，性能驱动的策略演变可能破坏完整性保证。

Method: 引入确定性因果结构（DCS），发展最小公理理论并进行相关证明。

Result: 证明了存在唯一性、策略无关不变性、观测等价性和公理最小性；DCS能解决CRDTs无法处理的因果模糊问题，移除任何公理确定性会变为模糊性。

Conclusion: DCS是异步计算的边界原则，建立了正确性底盘范式，可模块化、安全且可演化地构建分布式智能系统。

Abstract: In distributed multi-agent systems, correctness is often entangled with
operational policies such as scheduling, batching, or routing, which makes
systems brittle since performance-driven policy evolution may break integrity
guarantees. This paper introduces the Deterministic Causal Structure (DCS), a
formal foundation that decouples correctness from policy. We develop a minimal
axiomatic theory and prove four results: existence and uniqueness,
policy-agnostic invariance, observational equivalence, and axiom minimality.
These results show that DCS resolves causal ambiguities that value-centric
convergence models such as CRDTs cannot address, and that removing any axiom
collapses determinism into ambiguity. DCS thus emerges as a boundary principle
of asynchronous computation, analogous to CAP and FLP: correctness is preserved
only within the expressive power of a join-semilattice. All guarantees are
established by axioms and proofs, with only minimal illustrative constructions
included to aid intuition. This work establishes correctness as a fixed,
policy-agnostic substrate, a Correctness-as-a-Chassis paradigm, on which
distributed intelligent systems can be built modularly, safely, and evolvably.

Abstract: Exponential growth in heterogeneous healthcare data arising from electronic
health records (EHRs), medical imaging, wearable sensors, and biomedical
research has accelerated the adoption of data lakes and centralized
architectures capable of handling the Volume, Variety, and Velocity of Big Data
for advanced analytics. However, without effective governance, these
repositories risk devolving into disorganized data swamps. Ontology-driven
semantic data management offers a robust solution by linking metadata to
healthcare knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing semantic interoperability,
improving data discoverability, and enabling expressive, domain-aware access.
This review adopts a systematic research strategy, formulating key research
questions and conducting a structured literature search across major academic
databases, with selected studies analyzed and classified into six categories of
ontology-driven healthcare analytics: (i) ontology-driven integration
frameworks, (ii) semantic modeling for metadata enrichment, (iii)
ontology-based data access (OBDA), (iv) basic semantic data management, (v)
ontology-based reasoning for decision support, and (vi) semantic annotation for
unstructured data. We further examine the integration of ontology technologies
with Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and so on, highlighting
their combined potential to deliver scalable and intelligent healthcare
analytics. For each category, recent techniques, representative case studies,
technical and organizational challenges, and emerging trends such as artificial
intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and real-time
analytics are reviewed to guide the development of sustainable, interoperable,
and high-performance healthcare data ecosystems.

Result: 提高了吞吐量，减少长上下文失败，实现无上下文长度硬限制或惩罚的稳定大规模训练。

Conclusion: EARL系统能有效解决强化学习系统扩展的瓶颈，实现高效的代理强化学习。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal component of large language
model (LLM) post-training, and agentic RL extends this paradigm to operate as
agents through multi-turn interaction and tool use. Scaling such systems
exposes two practical bottlenecks: (1) context length grows rapidly during
training, inflating memory usage and latency, and triggering out-of-memory
(OOM) failures; and (2) intermediate tensors accumulate with context length,
making cross-device data movement a major system bottleneck.
  We present EARL, a scalable system for efficient agentic RL. EARL designs a
parallelism selector that dynamically adapts model and training parallelism
across RL stages based on sequence length and system load, and a data
dispatcher that performs layout-aware, decentralized exchange of intermediate
data batches. Together, these components increase throughput, reduce
long-context failures, and enable stable large-scale training of agentic LLMs
without relying on hard limits or penalties of context length.

Motivation: 解决多仓库容量车辆路径问题，找到总成本最小的路径集合，满足每个路径从仓库出发并返回，最多包含k个客户，且每个客户至少在一条路径上。

Method: 对CVRP - MD的新LP松弛进行舍入。

Result: 得到了一个3.9365 - 近似解。

cost such that each tour starts and ends at some depot $r \in R$ and includes
at most $k$ clients and such that each client lies on at least one tour. Our
main result is a $3.9365$-approximation based on rounding a new LP relaxation

Motivation: 现有过滤器无法关联键值，导致应用需复杂变通方法且性能下降，需要合适的抽象数据结构。

Method: 对SplinterDB、Squeakr和Mantis进行详细案例研究。

Result: 发现通用模式，证明统一的maplet抽象可带来更简单设计和更好性能。

Conclusion: 各领域应用默认使用maplet比过滤器更有益。

Abstract: Filters such as Bloom, quotient, and cuckoo filters are fundamental building
blocks providing space-efficient approximate set membership testing. However,
many applications need to associate small values with keys-functionality that
filters do not provide. This mismatch forces complex workarounds that degrade
performance. We argue that maplets-space-efficient data structures for
approximate key-value mappings-are the right abstraction. A maplet provides the
same space benefits as filters while natively supporting key-value associations
with one-sided error guarantees. Through detailed case studies of SplinterDB
(LSM-based key-value store), Squeakr (k-mer counter), and Mantis (genomic
sequence search), we identify the common patterns and demonstrate how a unified
maplet abstraction can lead to simpler designs and better performance. We
conclude that applications benefit from defaulting to maplets rather than
filters across domains including databases, computational biology, and
networking.

Method: 聚焦树宽（tw）和时间路径数（tpn）等参数，分析不同参数值下openTCC和closedTCC问题的复杂度。

Result: 单个参数不足以保证固定参数可处理性，如tw=9时openTCC和closedTCC是NP难问题，tpn=6时closedTCC是NP难问题；openTCC在以tpn为参数时属于XP；部分参数组合下问题变为固定参数可处理。

Conclusion: 不同参数及其组合对最大时间连通分量问题的可处理性有不同影响，部分参数组合能使问题变为固定参数可处理。

Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of maximum temporal connected
components (tccs) in temporal graphs, i.e., graphs that deterministically
change over time. In a tcc, any pair of vertices must be able to reach each
other via a time-respecting path. We consider both problems of maximum open
tccs (openTCC), which allow temporal paths through vertices outside the
component, and closed tccs (closedTCC) which require at least one temporal path
entirely within the component for every pair. We focus on the structural
parameter of treewidth, tw, and the recently introduced temporal parameter of
temporal path number, tpn, which is the minimum number of paths needed to fully
describe a temporal graph. We prove that these parameters on their own are not
sufficient for fixed parameter tractability: both openTCC and closedTCC are
NP-hard even when tw=9, and closedTCC is NP-hard when tpn=6. In contrast, we
prove that openTCC is in XP when parameterized by tpn. On the positive side, we
show that both problem become fixed parameter tractable under various
combinations of structural and temporal parameters that include, tw plus tpn,
tw plus the lifetime of the graph, and tw plus the maximum temporal degree.

Abstract: Many real-world applications pose challenges in incorporating fairness
constraints into the $k$-center clustering problem, where the dataset consists
of $m$ demographic groups, each with a specified upper bound on the number of
centers to ensure fairness. Focusing on big data scenarios, this paper
addresses the problem in a streaming setting, where data points arrive one by
one sequentially in a continuous stream. Leveraging a structure called the
$\lambda$-independent center set, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm
that first computes a reserved set of points during the streaming process.
Then, for the post-streaming process, we propose an approach for selecting
centers from the reserved point set by analyzing all three possible cases,
transforming the most complicated one into a specially constrained vertex cover
problem in an auxiliary graph. Our algorithm achieves a tight approximation
ratio of 5 while consuming $O(k\log n)$ memory. It can also be readily adapted
to solve the offline fair $k$-center problem, achieving a 3-approximation ratio
that matches the current state of the art. Furthermore, we extend our approach
to a semi-structured data stream, where data points from each group arrive in
batches. In this setting, we present a 3-approximation algorithm for $m = 2$
and a 4-approximation algorithm for general $m$. Lastly, we conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate the performance of our approaches, demonstrating that
they outperform existing baselines in both clustering cost and runtime
efficiency.

Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems that are fundamental to testing
in modern configurable software systems, e.g., in automotive industries. In
pairwise interaction sampling, we are given a (potentially very large)
configuration space, in which each dimension corresponds to a possible Boolean
feature of a software system; valid configurations are the satisfying
assignments of a given propositional formula $\varphi$. The objective is to
find a minimum-sized family of configurations, such that each pair of features
is jointly tested at least once. Due to its relevance in Software Engineering,
this problem has been studied extensively for over 20 years. In addition to new
theoretical insights (we prove BH-hardness), we provide a broad spectrum of key
contributions on the practical side that allow substantial progress for the
practical performance. Remarkably, we are able to solve the largest instances
we found in published benchmark sets (with about 500000000 feasible
interactions) to provable optimality. Previous approaches were not even able to
compute feasible solutions.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional metric spaces
is a fundamental problem with many applications. Over the past decade,
proximity graph (PG)-based indexes have demonstrated superior empirical
performance over alternatives. However, these methods often lack theoretical
guarantees regarding the quality of query results, especially in the worst-case
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the {\alpha}-convergent graph
({\alpha}-CG), a new PG structure that employs a carefully designed edge
pruning rule. This rule eliminates candidate neighbors for each data point p by
applying the shifted-scaled triangle inequalities among p, its existing
out-neighbors, and new candidates. If the distance between the query point q
and its exact nearest neighbor v* is at most {\tau} for some constant {\tau} >
0, our {\alpha}-CG finds the exact nearest neighbor in poly-logarithmic time,
assuming bounded intrinsic dimensionality for the dataset; otherwise, it can
find an ANN in the same time. To enhance scalability, we develop the
{\alpha}-convergent neighborhood graph ({\alpha}-CNG), a practical variant that
applies the pruning rule locally within each point's neighbors. We also
introduce optimizations to reduce the index construction time. Experimental
results show that our {\alpha}-CNG outperforms existing PGs on real-world
datasets. For most datasets, {\alpha}-CNG can reduce the number of distance
computations and search steps by over 15% and 45%, respectively, when compared
with the best-performing baseline.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} problem, where the input
consists of two vertex-labeled graphs $G$ and $H$, and the goal is to determine
whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ via a sequence of edge contractions.
  Lafond and Marchand~[WADS 2025] initiated the parameterized complexity study
of this problem, showing it to be \(\W[1]\)-hard when parameterized by the
number \(k\) of allowed contractions. They also proved that the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-width \(\tw\) of
\(G\), via an application of Courcelle's theorem resulting in a
non-constructive algorithm.
  In this work, we present a constructive fixed-parameter algorithm for
\textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with running time \(2^{\mathcal{O}(\tw^2)}
\cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). We also prove that unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis (\ETH) fails, it does not admit an algorithm running in time
\(2^{o(\tw^2)} \cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). This result adds
\textsc{Labeled Contractibility} to a small list of problems that admit such a
lower bound and matching algorithm.
  We further strengthen existing hardness results by showing that the problem
remains \NP-complete even when both input graphs have bounded maximum degree.
We also investigate parameterizations by \((k + \delta(G))\) where
\(\delta(G)\) denotes the degeneracy of \(G\), and rule out the existence of
subexponential-time algorithms. This answers question raised in Lafond and
Marchand~[WADS 2025]. We additionally provide an improved \FPT\ algorithm with
better dependence on \((k + \delta(G))\) than previously known. Finally, we
analyze a brute-force algorithm for \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with
running time \(|V(H)|^{\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|)}\), and show that this running time

Conclusion: 提出的方法可解决含离群点的个体公平聚类问题，且能扩展到大型数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a local search-based algorithm for individually
fair clustering in the presence of outliers. We consider the individual
fairness definition proposed in Jung et al., which requires that each of the
$n$ points in the dataset must have one of the $k$ centers within its $n/k$
nearest neighbors. However, if the dataset is known to contain outliers, the
set of fair centers obtained under this definition might be suboptimal for
non-outlier points. In order to address this issue, we propose a method that
discards a set of points marked as outliers and computes the set of fair
centers for the remaining non-outlier points. Our method utilizes a randomized
variant of local search, which makes it scalable to large datasets. We also
provide an approximation guarantee of our method as well as a bound on the
number of outliers discarded. Additionally, we demonstrate our claims
experimentally on a set of real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出计算EFX分配的局部搜索算法，算法在测试中表现良好，还给出相同加性估值下的理论证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EFX是有吸引力的公平概念，其分配是否始终存在是公平分配领域的重要开放问题，需找到计算EFX分配的方法。

Method: 采用模拟退火算法，以EFX违规总数为目标函数，结合单转移邻域结构在分配空间中搜索。

Result: 算法在所有测试实例中都找到了EFX分配，可扩展到数百个代理和/或数千个物品的场景。

Conclusion: 算法简单且实证性能强，可作为评估未来方法的基准，同时给出相同加性估值下EFX分配存在性的替代证明。

Abstract: We present a simple local search algorithm for computing EFX (envy-free up to
any good) allocations of $m$ indivisible goods among $n$ agents with additive
valuations. EFX is a compelling fairness notion, and whether such allocations
always exist remains a major open question in fair division.
  Our algorithm employs simulated annealing with the total number of EFX
violations as an objective function together with a single-transfer
neighborhood structure to move through the space of allocations. It found an
EFX allocation in all the instances tested, which included thousands of
randomly generated inputs, and scaled to settings with hundreds of agents
and/or thousands of items. The algorithm's simplicity, along with its strong
empirical performance makes it a simple benchmark for evaluating future
approaches.
  On the theoretical side, we provide a potential function for identical
additive valuations, which ensures that any strict-descent procedure under the
single-transfer neighborhood ends at an EFX allocation. This represents an
alternative proof of existence for identical valuations.

Result: 能计算可行的无嫉妒分配或证明不可行性，可基于公平目标优化分配。

Conclusion: 所提方法将两种约束统一在一个算法框架中，推进了公平分配方法在现实平台的应用。

Abstract: We study the classical rent division problem, where $n$ agents must allocate
$n$ indivisible rooms and split a fixed total rent $R$. The goal is to compute
an envy-free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's room and
rent to their own. This problem has been extensively studied under standard
assumptions, where efficient algorithms for computing EF allocations are known.
  We extend this framework by introducing two practically motivated
constraints: (i) lower and upper bounds on room rents, and (ii) room-specific
budget for agents. We develop efficient combinatorial algorithms that either
compute a feasible EF allocation or certify infeasibility.
  We further design algorithms to optimize over EF allocations using natural
fairness objectives such as maximin utility, leximin utility, and minimum
utility spread. Our approach unifies both constraint types within a single
algorithmic framework, advancing the applicability of fair division methods in
real-world platforms such as Spliddit.

Conclusion: 不同成本度量对匹配机制的失真有影响，RepMatch机制在新目标下具有一定优势。

Abstract: We consider the matching problem in the metric distortion framework. There
are $n$ agents and $n$ items occupying points in a shared metric space, and the
goal is to design a matching mechanism that outputs a low-cost matching between
the agents and items, using only agents' ordinal rankings of the candidates by
distance. A mechanism has distortion $\alpha$ if it always outputs a matching
whose cost is within a factor of $\alpha$ of the optimum, in every instance
regardless of the metric space.
  Typically, the cost of a matching is measured in terms of the total distance
between matched agents and items, but this measure can incentivize unfair
outcomes where a handful of agents bear the brunt of the cost. With this in
mind, we consider how the metric distortion problem changes when the cost is
instead measured in terms of the maximum cost of any agent. We show that while
these two notions of distortion can in general differ by a factor of $n$, the
distortion of a variant of the state-of-the-art mechanism, RepMatch, actually
improves from $O(n^2)$ under the sum objective to $O(n^{1.58})$ under the max
objective. We also show that for any fairness objective defined by a monotone
symmetric norm, this algorithm guarantees distortion $O(n^2)$.

Abstract: Myerson's seminal characterization of the revenue-optimal auction for a
single item \cite{myerson1981optimal} remains a cornerstone of mechanism
design. However, generalizing this framework to multi-item settings has proven
exceptionally challenging. Even under restrictive assumptions, closed-form
characterizations of optimal mechanisms are rare and are largely confined to
the single-agent case \cite{pavlov2011optimal,hart2017approximate,
daskalakis2018transport, GIANNAKOPOULOS2018432}, departing from the two-item
setting only when prior distributions are uniformly distributed
\cite{manelli2006bundling, daskalakis2017strong,giannakopoulos2018sjm}. In this
work, we build upon the bi-valued setting introduced by Yao
\cite{YAO_BIC_DSIC}, where each item's value has support 2 and lies in $\{a,
b\}$. Yao's result provides the only known closed-form optimal mechanism for
multiple agents. We extend this line of work along three natural axes,
establishing the first closed-form optimal mechanisms in each of the following
settings: (i) $n$ i.i.d. agents and $m$ i.i.d. items (ii) $n$ non-i.i.d. agents
and two i.i.d. items and (iii) $n$ i.i.d. agents and two non-i.i.d. items. Our
results lie at the limit of what is considered possible, since even with a
single agent and m bi-valued non-i.i.d. items, finding the optimal mechanism is
$\#P$-Hard \cite{daskalakis2014complexity, xi2018soda}. We finally generalize
the discrete analog of a result from~\cite{daskalakis2017strong}, showing that
for a single agent with $m$ items drawn from arbitrary (non-identical) discrete
distributions, grand bundling is optimal when all item values are sufficiently
large. We further show that for any continuous product distribution, grand
bundling achieves $\mathrm{OPT} - \epsilon$ revenue for large enough values.

Abstract: Decentralized coordination and digital contracting are becoming critical in
complex industrial ecosystems, yet existing approaches often rely on ad hoc
heuristics or purely technical blockchain implementations without a rigorous
economic foundation. This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart
contract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and
fairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and
uniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism
design, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate
performance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept
real-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee
volatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case
study illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in
realistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while
remaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond
steady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy
relevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource
allocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable
coordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with
empirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only
as technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency,
accountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation.

Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to
directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow
value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function)
and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a
ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve
this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,
efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine
Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two
novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to
interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of
higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of
the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements
and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with
vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The
latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of
hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply
a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical
properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the
projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion
algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain
previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new
perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph
structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up
the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine
learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many
more.

Conclusion: 任何易受合谋影响的机制，也易受小规模合谋影响。

Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain
context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than
traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of
a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a
collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work
\cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the
$1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms
equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption
of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism
vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.

Motivation: ICR范式虽有效，但随着候选列表增长，效率成为显著挑战，尤其是注意力操作与上下文长度呈二次/超线性缩放。

Method: 识别ICR微调的大语言模型注意力中的内在可利用结构，提出BlockRank方法，包括架构上强制文档间块稀疏性，微调时用辅助对比训练目标优化查询 - 文档块相关性。

Result: 在BEIR、MSMarco和NQ上实验表明，FLARE Mistral匹配或超越现有SOTA列表排序器和受控微调基线，推理更高效，能优雅扩展到长上下文短列表。

Conclusion: BlockRank为ICR提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval
(IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly
incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the
model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s).
While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm,
especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of
attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first
identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs
finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within
each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and
(2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query
tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that
document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce
BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the
attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed
inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to
linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block
relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary
contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments
on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches
or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned
baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100
MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context
shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length)
within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.

Abstract: In the digital era, the exponential growth of scientific publications has
made it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently identify and
access relevant work. This paper presents an automated framework for research
article classification and recommendation that leverages Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Using a large-scale arXiv.org
dataset spanning more than three decades, we evaluate multiple feature
extraction approaches (TF--IDF, Count Vectorizer, Sentence-BERT, USE,
Mirror-BERT) in combination with diverse machine learning classifiers (Logistic
Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and
k-Nearest Neighbour). Our experiments show that Logistic Regression with
TF--IDF consistently yields the best classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 69\%. To complement classification, we incorporate a recommendation
module based on the cosine similarity of vectorized articles, enabling
efficient retrieval of related research papers. The proposed system directly
addresses the challenge of information overload in digital libraries and
demonstrates a scalable, data-driven solution to support literature discovery.

Conclusion: AgenDR框架能缓解幻觉问题，可扩展到大型目录，通过关系推理提高推荐相关性。

Abstract: Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors
by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle
with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a
largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning
to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between
items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional
ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent
framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation
tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while
utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on
personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement
relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination,
scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through
relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery
datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking
performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying
tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly
measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.

Abstract: Research and development on conversational recommender systems (CRSs)
critically depends on sound and reliable evaluation methodologies. However, the
interactive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic
evaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and
identifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections
and the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this
critique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and
demonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and
performance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations,
this work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic
interaction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we
propose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework,
designed to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different
simulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and
reveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system
rankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a
significant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future
research and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: News recommender systems increasingly determine what news individuals see
online. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued
recommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an
alternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support
the media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending
news based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there
continues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender
systems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs
such systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in
practice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to
train modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First,
we identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of
the diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature.
Based on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public
datasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into
diversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European
law and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the
data they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Result: 模型完全无视数据波动，且偏向低频价格变动的数据。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融应用中存在对数据波动的忽视和对低频价格变动数据的偏向问题。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: 本文提出从单点优化到生成式逆向设计的范式转变，引入基于CVAE的框架用于翼型自噪声最小化问题，生成多样设计方案且性能优于基线方法，提升工程设计过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理模型的优化（SBO）收敛于单点解，限制设计空间探索，本文旨在解决此问题，实现从单点优化到生成式逆向设计的转变。

Method: 引入基于条件变分自编码器（CVAE）的框架，学习系统设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，以生成多样的高性能候选方案，并以翼型自噪声最小化问题为例，用先前基准研究中的高性能SBO方法作基线。

Result: CVAE框架成功生成256个新设计，有效率94.1%，77.2%的有效设计性能优于SBO基线的最优设计。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能找到更高质量的解决方案，还能提供多样的候选方案，从根本上提升工程设计过程，实现多标准决策。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Method: 提出QIF神经元模型离散化方法，从离散化参数集推导替代梯度窗口的解析公式以确保训练稳定。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10、CIFAR - 100、ImageNet和CIFAR - 10 DVS数据集上，所提方法优于基于LIF的先进方法。

Conclusion: QIF神经元离散化是深度SNN中LIF神经元的有力替代方案，兼具丰富动态性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济和人工智能技术对城市可持续发展重要，需研究其对城市碳排放影响。

Method: 提出MADCN框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，用SHAP进行可解释学习，用275个中国城市面板数据测试。

Result: MADCN模型预测性能优于传统模型，SHAP分析显示人口等是影响碳排放主要因素，新技术因素有一定作用。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力等技术发展可减碳，政策应将科技创新融入减碳策略。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型在处理隐私友好数据和应对数据分布偏移方面有效。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

Result: 在多骨干网络的长上下文和测试时扩展设置中，2比特有持续增益，4比特平均比FP16下降0.08%，测试时扩展精度平均提高10%，吞吐量提升1.4倍，支持的批次增大1.25倍。

Conclusion: PatternKV方案能有效改善低比特KV量化的保真度，提升模型在推理时的性能。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

Conclusion: 得到具有显式、单位感知阈值的紧凑符号方程，将可解释性作为建模约束，使符号回归适用于制度切换和治理部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合部署在现实世界的物联网环境中。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在一系列合成问题和真实世界星系观测中有效。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Result: 所有考虑的预训练深度卷积神经网络挫折度都低于零模型，网络行为接近单调。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络比零模型有更有序的行为，存在一种新的隐式正则化形式。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Conclusion: 所提方法实用，Lipschitz估计与网络鲁棒性紧密对齐。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Method: 引入Tensor - on - Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN)统一两种范式。

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

Result: 能显著提升基于DT算法的性能，部分结果达最先进水平。

Conclusion: AG方法有效解决DT存在的问题，提升其性能。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

Conclusion: 给出了基于学习的Q先验的Thompson风格RL的首个元遗憾保证，为实验丰富的场景提供实用方法。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: MCNO 可自然扩展到高维问题，为连续域偏微分方程提供了理论支持的替代方法。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Conclusion: ePF算法通过平衡对不同解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了PF的鲁棒性，带来更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

Conclusion: 提出的两种正则化策略能有效提升模型在对抗训练中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Conclusion: 成功训练的JEPA可用于获取样本概率，JEPA - SCORE方法有效。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

Motivation: DPO依赖固定温度参数，在多样偏好数据上训练欠佳，现有改进方法如IPO和β - DPO存在不足，需更好的偏好对齐方法。

Method: 采用两步法，先训练奖励模型估计偏好边际，再用这些边际为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重。

Result: 在情感生成任务实验中，MADPO在不同质量数据集上均显著优于强基线，高质量数据上性能提升达33.3%，低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO是一种更稳健、更有原则的偏好对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性和安全性至关重要，但实际中训练数据有限，贝叶斯神经网络在小数据场景有优势，可用于OOD检测。

Method: 引入基于期望对数向量的贝叶斯事后OOD分数，比较5种贝叶斯和4种确定性事后OOD分数。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR - 10的训练样本不超过5000的实验中，贝叶斯方法表现优于对应的确定性方法。

Conclusion: 在小训练数据情况下，基于贝叶斯神经网络的OOD检测方法效果更好。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 解决太阳物理中NLFFF问题，传统方法依赖迭代数值方法，有局限性。

Method: 将ECA机制与DC结合，训练中施加物理信息损失，使预测符合物理规律。

Result: 在ISEE NLFFF数据集上，PIANO准确性优于现有神经算子，且与NLFFF数据物理特性高度一致。

Conclusion: PIANO是解决NLFFF问题的有效方法。

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

Result: 界在Langevin蒙特卡罗算法近似下稳定，在真实标签数据上有非平凡预测，能正确上界随机标签的测试误差。

Conclusion: 低温插值机制下的泛化可由经典高温机制下的小训练误差预示。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练通信频繁会饱和带宽，低频通信策略应用于自适应优化器时与全同步DDP有性能差距，原因是时间尺度不匹配。

Method: 提出MT - DAO优化器，利用多个快慢移动的一阶动量或梯度跨不同时间尺度跟踪更新动态，并给出收敛保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中消除与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度上优于低频通信基线，在以太网互连下减少6 - 27%的等令牌时钟时间；720M规模下，比单动量DDP基线用更少步骤和时间达到目标困惑度。

Conclusion: MT - DAO能实现有效的跨数据中心训练和广域训练。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoLDS在复杂嘈杂环境应用受限，张量法在噪声下性能下降，EM法对初始化敏感、易陷入局部极小值。

Method: 先使用张量法获得全局一致的混合权重和系统参数估计，再通过卡尔曼EM算法细化参数。

Result: 在合成数据上比纯张量法和随机初始化EM法更可靠、鲁棒；在真实神经数据中成功建模和聚类不同条件。

Conclusion: MoLDS是建模复杂神经数据的有效框架，Tensor - EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法。

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低精度的KV缓存量化会引入显著误差，降低生成质量

Method: 结合Hadamard旋转和轻量级线性校正适配器，实现自定义注意力内核

Result: 在多个模型家族评估中匹配或超越强基线，实现更高KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍

Conclusion: KVLinC能有效缓解极低精度量化误差，实现高效长上下文LLM推理

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Method: 研究数据、任务和深度学习表征中局部性和组合性的作用。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Result: 得到的指标在[0,1]区间，不同图描述符间可比，实验表明PGD比MMD指标更稳健、更有洞察力。

Conclusion: PGD是一种更好的评估图生成模型的框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DVI框架加速自回归解码，实现无损提速且训练开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投机解码系统存在需大量离线训练、额外组件等问题，导致数据/计算成本高且草稿生成器在分布漂移时不稳定。

Method: 将大语言模型划分为草稿生成器和验证器，把验证器的决策转化为监督信号更新草稿生成器头，采用KL→RL调度进行在线蒸馏和添加奖励掩码交叉熵。

Result: 在Spec - Bench上实现2.16倍墙时加速，与EAGLE - 2相当，训练所需数据少，消融实验表明优于仅KL在线蒸馏。

Conclusion: 训练感知的自投机可以在最小训练开销下实现无损提速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Method: 对PINNs、NODEs和NOs三类PIML框架进行综述，介绍其在生物医学不同领域的应用。

Result: 强调了这三类框架在生物医学科学与工程中的作用，指出传统黑箱学习在某些场景的不足。

Conclusion: 识别出推进PIML在生物医学领域发展面临的挑战，如不确定性量化、泛化以及与大语言模型的整合等。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: 提出ARLAS框架应对大语言模型代理工具使用中的间接提示注入风险，评估显示其有效降低攻击成功率并提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型代理工具使用存在间接提示注入风险，当前防御策略因依赖手工攻击模式而有局限性。

Method: 提出ARLAS框架，将问题建模为两人零和博弈，共同训练两个大语言模型，采用基于种群的学习框架。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上评估，经ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，任务成功率提高。

Conclusion: 对抗过程生成多样且有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型，代理更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Motivation: 以往DeepGR4J模型虽提升了降雨 - 径流预测准确性，但缺乏对径流预测不确定性的量化，且需识别极端流量事件和进行多步预测，以更好服务水管理。

Method: 使用分位数回归的集成学习框架扩展DeepGR4J模型，设计实验用CAMELS - Aus数据集评估框架。

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架适用于径流预测不确定性量化和洪水早期预警系统。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 论文提出Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ)解决大语言模型协作训练的通信效率和计算开销问题，实验表明其效果好且实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型快速扩展，给协作训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，需有效平衡低资源设备协作训练的效率和性能。

Method: 引入Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ)策略，通过位正则化基于特征和层的重要性分配位预算，将激活和梯度从高精度压缩到低精度。

Result: 在相同位预算下，AMAQ比固定精度方法表现更好，提升生成和分类准确率，增强训练稳定性，减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，以较小通信开销实现更高推理准确率，是低通信成本协作训练的实用有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Motivation: 现有机器学习分子动力学方法存在灵活性和模拟效率受限、泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出ATOM模型，采用准等变设计，无需显式分子图，使用时间注意力机制；构建TG80数据集用于跨化学品和时间尺度的预训练。

Conclusion: ATOM是迈向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Result: NorMuon在多模型规模实验中始终优于Adam和Muon，在1.1B预训练设置下训练效率比Adam高21.74%，比Muon高11.31%，内存占用与Muon相当。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习优化器设计开辟新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估依赖自我报告或非特异性EKG生命体征，使特定患者面临疼痛治疗不足和阿片类药物过度使用问题，需EEG技术缓解。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人在三种激光诱发疼痛强度下的数据，将每个4秒时期转换为537维特征向量，用留一参与者交叉验证评估9种传统机器学习模型。

Result: 径向基函数核支持向量机离线性能最佳，准确率88.9%，推理时间1.02毫秒；实时XGBoost模型端到端延迟约4毫秒，准确率94.2%。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测在临床技术上可行，为临床验证提供途径。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Conclusion: NeST - BO方法在高维贝叶斯优化问题上表现出色，具有较好的收敛性。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效同时缓解RLHF和DPO训练中的三个问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Result: 提供估计对齐矩阵稳定性的理论保证，通过大量合成和真实数据实验证明能提高目标图估计准确性。

Conclusion: GTRANS能有效提高目标图估计准确性，直接提升下游应用（如图分类和链接预测）的性能。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

TL;DR: 提出ARMOR算法解决大语言模型半结构化剪枝性能下降问题，实验显示其优于现有2:4剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算和内存需求大，现有2:4半结构化剪枝方法会导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 引入ARMOR算法，将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销块对角矩阵，通过块坐标下降算法选择稀疏核心和块对角矩阵。

Result: 理论证明优化能收敛到代理损失不高于现有剪枝算法的解，在Llama和Qwen模型族实验中，ARMOR显著优于现有2:4剪枝方法。

Conclusion: ARMOR在保持2:4剪枝推理加速和内存减少优势的同时，在模型压缩和任务准确性之间实现了更有效的权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

TL;DR: 提出LATTA方法解决现有TTA方法的不稳定和遗忘源知识问题，实验表明其显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法如Tent存在不稳定和易遗忘源知识问题，尤其是小批量或挑战性损坏时。

Method: 引入Langevin - Anchored Test - Time Adaptation (LATTA)，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚两个机制进行正则化适应。

Result: 在Rotated - MNIST和CIFAR - 10 - C等基准测试中，LATTA显著优于Tent、CoTTA和EATA等现有方法，提高CIFAR - 10 - C平均准确率超2%并降低性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA能有效适应且不牺牲稳定性，无需架构更改或昂贵蒙特卡罗过程，为自监督TTA设定了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性、鲁棒性、效率和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly
available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedCAPS-08BF.

Conclusion: 为YaRN和Qwen的注意力缩放提供了严格的理论依据，解释了对数缩放能在大上下文长度下保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Result: 在真实和合成时间图上的实验显示，TGAE在模拟质量和效率上优于现有时间图生成器。

Conclusion: TGAE是一种高效的时间图生成方法，能在模拟质量和效率间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统协作学习基于模型权重共享，基于嵌入共享的方案有资源效率优势，但目前缺乏差分隐私机制。

Method: 提出Ours方法，联合学习隐私编码网络和小效用生成网络，生成带差分隐私保证的嵌入，与服务器协作。

Result: 协作和隐私学习的协同设计只需一轮私有化通信，客户端计算量比传统方法小，共享的嵌入与服务器模型类型无关。

Conclusion: 所提方法在协作和隐私学习上有优势，减少通信轮数和客户端计算量。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

Motivation: 机器学习模型会泄露敏感信息，大语言模型因使用大量数据训练使信息泄露风险加剧，需在发布前量化隐私风险。

Method: 提出信息论的成员推理方法InfoRMIA；提出从token层面研究成员推理和记忆。

Conclusion: InfoRMIA能有效量化隐私风险，token层面分析为大语言模型隐私研究提供新视角，可实现更有针对性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

Conclusion: 所提出的TimePD框架在无源自适应时间序列预测问题上有效。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

Motivation: 理解深度学习在物理和计算系统中可预测性的基本限制。

Method: 通过分析将深度学习中常见的特征（如混沌学习动态和对称诱导不变子空间）联系起来，推导交错吸引域出现的充分条件。

Result: 吸引域具有无限精细的分形结构，不确定性指数接近零，增加初始条件精度对结果可预测性提升有限。

Conclusion: 交错现象对神经网络训练的可预测性和可重复性施加了基本限制，为深度学习提供了通用组织原则，对优化和人工智能安全部署有重要意义。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应（TTA）方法计算成本高、需大量数据或对超参数敏感，需改进。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，通过将目标数据嵌入重新置于原点，改善源样本和分布偏移样本的对齐。

Result: 在多数据集上提升分类准确率，在计算量最少情况下击败多个TTA方法；在模型校准指标上表现良好；能跨类别提升准确率；在设备上减少推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 基于3种ViT架构和4个数据集的结果表明，NEO可高效有效地用于TTA。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Conclusion: 本文为开发能平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出vAttention稀疏注意力机制，结合top - k和采样，有精度保证，实验显示其提升稀疏注意力质量并缩小与全注意力差距，可用于推理场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在近似全注意力时有局限，缺乏近似质量保证，限制实际部署。

Method: 结合top - k和随机采样，利用采样的统计保证，引入有用户指定(ε, δ)近似精度保证的vAttention机制。

Result: vAttention在多个模型和数据集上显著提升稀疏注意力质量，缩小与全注意力差距，能在推理场景实现快速解码且不降低模型质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是向大规模实用、可靠部署稀疏注意力迈出的重要一步，统一top - k和采样后表现优于二者单独使用。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 提出的原对偶DPO方法在大语言模型受限对齐问题上有效，能降低成本且有理论支撑，扩展到在线数据设置后有较好效果。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在多样的真实世界基准测试中，DiffSDA在序列解纠缠方面优于近期的先进方法。

Conclusion: DiffSDA是一种新颖、模态无关的框架，能有效应用于不同的真实世界数据模态。

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有掩码扩散模型语言建模中，去掩码位置选择依赖规则调度，缺乏理论保证且是临时改进，需更好方法。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为带显式参考策略的KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程，优化正则化目标。

Result: 理论证明优化策略生成样本更接近数据分布；实验上在四个基准测试中，学习策略始终优于最大置信度方法，如在SUDOKU上比随机方法高20.1%，比最大置信度方法高11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习调度器比基于规则的启发式调度器效果更好。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Method: 研究直接通信和课程学习两种方法，通过4人猎鹿博弈和带惩罚的迭代公共品博弈实验。

Result: 一字“廉价谈话”通道使4人猎鹿博弈合作率从0%提升到48.3%；课程学习对设计选择敏感，特定课程使带惩罚的迭代公共品博弈中智能体收益降低27.4%，强调背叛均衡的课程会导致智能体“习得性悲观”。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比基于经验的训练更可靠，社会困境的课程设计需关注游戏序列中的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

Motivation: 现有研究未充分检验HGNNs是否本质有效，多为隐含假设其有效性，因此开展研究。

Method: 从模型架构和异质信息两方面研究，在21个数据集和20个基线模型上系统复现并进行超参数调整，开发因果效应估计框架进行事实和反事实分析。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能无因果影响；异质信息通过增加同质性和局部 - 全局分布差异，使节点类别更易区分，有积极因果影响。

Conclusion: 模型架构复杂度不影响HGNNs性能，异质信息对HGNNs性能有积极因果作用。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

Motivation: 现有对迁移学习微调模型的MIAs评估仅依赖少量攻击类型，需全面评估以助从业者识别高效攻击进行隐私风险评估。

Method: 比较迁移学习场景下不同MIAs的性能。

Result: 基于分数的MIAs攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低；没有一种MIA能捕获所有隐私风险；似然比攻击（LiRA）在多数实验场景表现优越，逆海森矩阵攻击（IHA）在高数据量下对PatchCamelyon数据集微调模型更有效。

Conclusion: 为从业者在迁移学习中评估模型隐私风险选择有效攻击提供参考。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

Result: 在真实数据集实验表明，在特定隐私预算下方法有效，合成数据集能复制非隐私数据集统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架能实现基因组数据的隐私共享，为研究人员提供灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验，MDTI始终优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MDTI具有鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,

introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Motivation: Transformers计算复杂度高，线性注意力预训练昂贵，现有后训练线性化混合方法有缺陷。

Method: 提出三种解决方案：推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；HedgeCATs结合注意力权重转移与目标LoRA微调；Scheduled Sliding - window Dropout在训练中随机抑制softmax分支。

Result: 方法保持计算效率，恢复大部分基础模型性能，确保真正采用线性注意力。

Conclusion: 所提方法恢复了混合转换中性能归因的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is

TL;DR: 引入Carré du champ flow matching (CDC - FM)改进深度生成模型质量泛化权衡，实验证明其效果好且可集成到现有流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度生成模型高样本质量和记忆问题的权衡，即避免模型复制训练数据而缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 用几何感知噪声正则化概率路径，将FM中的均匀各向同性噪声替换为空间变化的各向异性高斯噪声。

Result: 在多样数据集和神经网络架构上实验，CDC - FM持续提供更好的质量泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和非均匀采样数据集上显著优于标准FM。

Conclusion: 为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆的相互作用提供数学框架，且算法可集成到现有流程。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Motivation: 高维数据影响机器学习模型可解释性和计算效率，现有基于大语言模型的特征选择方法缺乏结构化推理和透明决策依据。

Method: 引入LLM - FS - Agent多智能体架构，通过多个扮演特定角色的大语言模型智能体进行“辩论”，集体评估特征相关性并给出详细理由。

Conclusion: 提出的审议架构提升了决策透明度和计算效率，LLM - FS - Agent是实际应用的可靠方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中取得收益。

Conclusion: 挑战了现有不确定条件下解码的启发式方法，基于正确性校准解码规则有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 正式的科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，在数据有限的科学领域实现鲁棒的自监督学习。

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

Method: 引入molFTP表示法，实现虚拟掩码程序去除保留分子中片段信息，采用key - loo近似分子级LOO。

Result: key - loo在数据集上与真实分子级LOO偏差低于8%。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、抗泄漏的片段 - 目标流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或key - loo以较低成本近似LOO。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: 所提方法可在实际训练时间内实现现实世界驾驶策略学习。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: BLISS是一种有效的大语言模型数据选择方法，不依赖外部预训练模型且能考虑长期影响，性能良好。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Result: 模型有效减少生成时所需的编辑操作总数，在基准TPP的多种无条件和条件生成任务中展现出生成灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的Edit Flow过程是一个灵活高效的TPP模型，在不同生成任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Conclusion: 通过量化过平滑和使用G-Reg正则化，可提升深度图神经网络性能，避免参数不足或过度问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

Conclusion: failure - aware IRL是审计模型对齐和减少IRL过程歧义的强大可扩展方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出针对设备端大语言模型推理的轻量级在线延迟分析器lm - Meter，实现细粒度实时延迟捕获，有高分析精度和低系统开销，可揭示瓶颈、量化权衡并提供优化机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云部署大语言模型存在数据隐私和可持续性问题，设备端运行有优势但面临内存、计算需求和性能 - 效率权衡的挑战。

Method: 提出lm - Meter，在商业移动平台实现，可在无辅助设备下捕获相位和内核级的细粒度实时延迟。

Result: lm - Meter有高分析精度和低系统开销，如在最受限的节能模式下预填充吞吐量仅降低2.58%，解码降低0.99%，能揭示瓶颈、量化权衡。

Conclusion: lm - Meter为受限平台上大语言模型运行时行为提供可见性，为优化和设备端大语言模型系统普及奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务强化学习依赖任务元数据引导行为的问题。

Method: 提出LEXPOL架构，用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择或混合子策略，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上达到或超过强多任务基线，无需特定任务再训练；语言门控能组合专家策略以适应新任务描述和组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可在单一策略中有效索引和重组可复用技能。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新研究有轻尾噪声时DSGD的高概率（HP）收敛性，证明其在与均方误差（MSE）相同成本条件下HP收敛，移除限制假设，实现最优速率和线性加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置下HP研究有强假设，与MSE收敛假设差距大，而中心化设置中SGD在相同条件下HP和MSE都收敛，因此重新研究DSGD的HP保证。

Method: 仔细分析感兴趣量的矩生成函数（MGF）和用户模型间的共识差距的MGF，给出去中心化方法在HP意义下的方差缩减效应新结果和强凸成本MGF的更精细边界。

Result: DSGD在与MSE相同成本条件下HP收敛，移除了统一有界梯度等限制假设，实现非凸和强凸成本的最优速率，且有线性加速。

Conclusion: DSGD在HP意义下保持强性能，匹配现有MSE保证，给出的方差缩减效应和MGF边界结果有独立价值。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Motivation: 传统建模异构代理团队的方法依赖昂贵的人在环数据，限制可扩展性，需要新方法训练与策略不可访问或非平稳队友协作的代理。

Method: 提出用大语言模型作为人类代理生成合成数据，在受猎鹿博弈启发的网格世界捕获游戏中进行三个实验。

Conclusion: LLM虽不能完全复制人类适应性，但基于提示的多样性为模拟与策略无关的队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Method: 通过在从定制先验中采样的合成数据上持续预训练来扩展现有模型。

Result: TabPFN - Wide模型性能匹配或超越基础模型，对噪声有更好鲁棒性，能无缝扩展到超50000个特征，保持可解释性；在真实生物医学数据集上，模型识别的相关特征与以往生物学发现有重叠，也为未来研究提供潜在起点。

Conclusion: 基于先验的自适应方法适合增强基础模型处理高维数据的能力。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond
natural language, such as coding and science.

Conclusion: 轻量级参考引导的基础方法为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Conclusion: 通过战略性的训练超参干预可以大规模提高量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

Result: 实验显示Stratified GRPO在多种问答基准上始终大幅优于GRPO，实现更高训练奖励、稳定性和更有效搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层是解决大语言模型搜索代理强化学习中结构异质性的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir
computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the
reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing
(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked
activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous
stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a
subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural
responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature
space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification
using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the
biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural
activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the
performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a
standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate
that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,
highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational
substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of
integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the
goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can
inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

Abstract: Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is emerging as a promising memory interface

to the limited availability of production hardware. Key questions include: What
are the use cases for the CXL memory? What are the impacts of the CXL memory on
application performance? How to use the CXL memory in combination with existing
memory components? In this work, we study the performance of three genuine CXL
memory-expansion cards from different vendors. We characterize the basic
performance of the CXL memory, study how HPC applications and large language
models (LLM) can benefit from the CXL memory, and study the interplay between
memory tiering and page interleaving. We also propose a novel data object-level
interleaving policy to match the interleaving policy with memory access
patterns. Our findings reveal the challenges and opportunities of using the CXL
memory.

Result: 大量模拟研究表明该方法持续优于静态和基于优化的基线方法，接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习是自适应配置分配的强大新范式，适用于动态测试和资源调度领域。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous
pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments.
Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to
allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure
probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization
approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary
settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that
recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our
method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that
fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample
efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline
training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability
shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and
optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work
establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration
allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad
applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.

Conclusion: VeriGuard框架显著提高LLM代理的可信度，提供强大保障。

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous AI agents in sensitive domains, such as
healthcare, introduces critical risks to safety, security, and privacy. These
agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be
compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a
mechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined
safety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We
introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees
for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and
verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive
validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise
safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and
subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance
with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it
is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action
monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each
proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This
separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online
monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a
robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents.

Building on the LIBRO framework, we evaluate StarCoder and GPT-4o on Defects4J,
GHRB, and mutated variants that introduce linguistic and semantic challenges.
Our findings show that both models largely reproduce prior results with minor
deviations (\textit{Remember}), exhibit partial robustness to linguistic
rephrasings and translations while uncovering unique reproducible bugs
(\textit{Understand}), but suffer severe performance drops exceeding 60\% under
identifier mutations (\textit{Apply}). Conversely, providing near-identical
few-shot examples in an open-book setting improves success rates by up to three
times, and component-level analysis reveals that structured technical elements,
such as test code and method names, are far more impactful than narrative
descriptions for successful test generation (\textit{Analyze}). These insights
illuminate the cognitive processes underlying LLM-generated tests, suggest
concrete directions for improving performance, and establish a robust and
realistic evaluation paradigm for this task.

*Felicity Anderson,Julien Sindt,Neil Chue Hong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出数据驱动的RSE角色方法，分析GitHub上中型公共研究软件仓库，识别出七种不同交互性的角色，证明可分析大型数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 描述和识别研究软件工程（RSE）开发的常见和罕见模式，帮助个人和项目团队理解贡献、影响和仓库动态，为改进RSE奠定基础。

Method: 结合软件仓库挖掘和数据驱动角色方法，对GitHub上中型公共研究软件仓库贡献者的协作交互行为模式进行评估。

Result: 成功刻画了115,174名仓库贡献者，识别、命名并总结出七种不同交互性的角色。

Conclusion: 尽管软件项目存在项目管理因素、研究领域和贡献者背景不同的困难，仍可对大型数据集进行分析。

Abstract: We describe data-driven RSE personas: an approach combining software
repository mining and data-driven personas applied to research software (RS),
an attempt to describe and identify common and rare patterns of Research
Software Engineering (RSE) development. This allows individuals and RS project
teams to understand their contributions, impact and repository dynamics - an
important foundation for improving RSE. We evaluate the method on different
patterns of collaborative interaction behaviours by contributors to mid-sized
public RS repositories (those with 10-300 committers) on GitHub. We demonstrate
how the RSE personas method successfully characterises a sample of 115,174
repository contributors across 1,284 RS repositories on GitHub, sampled from
42,284 candidate software repository records queried from Zenodo. We identify,
name and summarise seven distinct personas from low to high interactivity:
Ephemeral Contributor; Occasional Contributor; Project Organiser; Moderate
Contributor; Low-Process Closer; Low-Coding Closer; and Active Contributor.
This demonstrates that large datasets can be analysed despite difficulties of
comparing software projects with different project management factors, research
domains and contributor backgrounds.

TL;DR: 研究人类和大语言模型（LLM）编写的代码审查评论类型及开发者常解决的评论类型，发现LLM和人类审查者各有优劣，部分LLM生成评论可被开发者解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解哪些类型的生成审查评论可能触发代码更改，识别可操作的评论。

Method: 开发LLM-as-a-Judge，基于自定义的五类分类法自动分类审查评论。

Result: LLM审查者和人类审查者在不同项目环境下各有优劣；可读性、漏洞和可维护性相关评论解决率高于代码设计相关评论。

Conclusion: 大量LLM生成的评论是可操作的，能被开发者解决，强调LLM和人类审查者的互补性并提出改进建议。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered code review automation tools have been
introduced to generate code review comments. However, not all generated
comments will drive code changes. Understanding what types of generated review
comments are likely to trigger code changes is crucial for identifying those
that are actionable. In this paper, we set out to investigate (1) the types of
review comments written by humans and LLMs, and (2) the types of generated
comments that are most frequently resolved by developers. To do so, we
developed an LLM-as-a-Judge to automatically classify review comments based on
our own taxonomy of five categories. Our empirical study confirms that (1) the
LLM reviewer and human reviewers exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses
depending on the project context, and (2) readability, bugs, and
maintainability-related comments had higher resolution rates than those focused
on code design. These results suggest that a substantial proportion of
LLM-generated comments are actionable and can be resolved by developers. Our
work highlights the complementarity between LLM and human reviewers and offers
suggestions to improve the practical effectiveness of LLM-powered code review
tools.

Method: 对711个随机抽样的与SECURITY.md相关的问题进行内容分类分析，对包括SECURITY.md在内的六个社区健康文件的问题关闭时间和响应数量进行定量比较分析。

Result: 79.5%的SECURITY.md相关问题是添加文件的请求，包含链接的报告关闭时间中位数短2天。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进安全报告政策和社区管理提供实用见解，有助于构建更安全的开源生态系统。

Abstract: GitHub recommends that projects adopt a SECURITY.md file that outlines
vulnerability reporting procedures. However, the effectiveness and operational
challenges of such files are not yet fully understood. This study aims to
clarify the challenges that SECURITY.md files face in the vulnerability
reporting process within open-source communities. Specifically, we classified
and analyzed the content of 711 randomly sampled issues related to SECURITY.md.
We also conducted a quantitative comparative analysis of the close time and
number of responses for issues concerning six community health files, including
SECURITY.md. Our analysis revealed that 79.5% of SECURITY.md-related issues
were requests to add the file, and reports that included links were closed,
with a median time that was 2 days shorter. These findings offer practical
insights for improving security reporting policies and community management,
ultimately contributing to a more secure open-source ecosystem.

optimizing software engineering processes to (i) enable software experts making
the best use of their time and (ii) support domain experts in producing
high-quality software. This paper outlines why this would be beneficial, what
such a digital twin could look like, and what is missing for realizing and
deploying software engineering digital twins.

Motivation: 设计适用于JetBrains IDEs交互使用的开放权重代码补全模型。

Method: 采用Llama架构，在约4T许可代码上预训练，有精心的数据管理、多阶段训练、通过直接偏好优化对齐等。

Result: 精心的数据整理和分阶段训练提升模型质量，具备关键编辑能力，紧凑的模型能满足交互补全成本和延迟要求。

Conclusion: 为将聚焦的开放模型从研究原型扩展到大规模生产提供实用蓝图。

Abstract: We present the Mellum models family, open-weight code completion models
designed for interactive use in JetBrains IDEs. Mellums have 4B parameters,
adopt a Llama-style architecture, and are pre-trained on ~4T tokens of
permissively licensed, multi-language code. Our studies show that (i) careful
data curation and staged training significantly improve the model's quality,
(ii) editor-critical capabilities such as context packing are necessary for
high-quality suggestions, and (iii) a compact, task-focused model can meet the
cost and latency constraints of interactive completion.
  In the paper, we describe an end-to-end industrial pipeline for producing
contextualized in-editor completion: disciplined data governance, multi-stage
training that includes fill-in-the-middle and project context via supervised
fine-tuning, and alignment via direct preference optimization using feedback
from real-world scenarios. Our quality evaluations include both large-scale
offline benchmarks and online telemetry from production deployments in
JetBrains IDEs. Mellums are released under the Apache-2.0 license on
HuggingFace, with a public model card providing a reproducible reference for
practitioners. Our experience offers a pragmatic blueprint for taking a
focused, open model from a research prototype to at scale production for
hundreds of thousands of users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新冠疫情改变工作模式，远程办公有挑战，研究不同工作模式对爱立信员工保留率的影响。

Method: 使用爱立信瑞典2016 - 2025年的HR数据，分析不同工作模式（现场、远程和混合）对员工保留率的影响，结合离职调查。

Result: 2021年夏到2023年夏离职率显著上升，远程入职员工三年内离职可能性大；公司最终恢复到疫情前保留率。

Conclusion: 混合办公环境中员工融入实践很重要，精心设计的混合模式有助于知识密集型公司留住员工。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered workplace structures,
normalizing remote work. However, critical evidence highlights challenges with
fully remote arrangements, particularly for software teams. This study
investigates employee resignation patterns at Ericsson, a global developer of
software-intensive systems, before, during, and after the pandemic. Using HR
data from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work
modalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our
findings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer
2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees
onboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign
within their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit
surveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary
organizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention. By
contrast, the company's eventual successful return to pre-pandemic retention
rates illustrates the value of differentiated work policies and supports
reconsidering selective return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Our study demonstrates
the importance of employee integration practices in hybrid environments where
the requirement for in-office presence for recent hires shall be accompanied by
in-office presence from their team members and more senior staff whose
mentoring and social interactions contribute to integration into the corporate
work environment. We hope these actionable insights will inform HR leaders and
policymakers in shaping post-pandemic work practices, demonstrating that
carefully crafted hybrid models anchored in organizational attachment and
mentorship can sustain retention in knowledge-intensive companies.

TL;DR: 本文提出构建由大语言模型驱动的报告系统的模式，解决了上下文窗口限制等问题并为开发者提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在报告系统中因上下文窗口限制无法直接部署，且缺乏可扩展报告架构的实践模式。

Method: 提出将查询生成与数据检索解耦的模式，引入扩展ResourceLink的双响应模式，以及多租户安全和资源生命周期管理模式。

Result: 提出了解决LLM驱动报告应用中基本挑战的模式。

Conclusion: 这些模式为构建LLM驱动报告系统的开发者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models translate natural language into database queries, yet
context window limitations prevent direct deployment in reporting systems where
complete datasets exhaust available tokens. The Model Context Protocol
specification defines ResourceLink for referencing external resources, but
practical patterns for implementing scalable reporting architectures remain
undocumented. This paper presents patterns for building LLM-powered reporting
systems that decouple query generation from data retrieval. We introduce a
dual-response pattern extending ResourceLink to support both iterative query
refinement and out-of-band data access, accompanied by patterns for
multi-tenant security and resource lifecycle management. These patterns address
fundamental challenges in LLM-driven reporting applications and provide
practical guidance for developers building them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注提示工程的个体技术，缺乏对软件开发人员更广泛工作流程的研究，因此开展该研究。

Method: 对91名软件工程师（其中72名是活跃的生成式AI用户）进行大规模调查，研究不同软件工程任务中的提示策略、对话模式和可靠性评估。

Result: 得出14项关键发现，如代码生成普遍，使用AI进行调试和代码审查等更细致任务与熟练度强相关，开发者更喜欢迭代多轮对话，文档任务被认为最可靠，复杂代码生成和调试有挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为当前开发者实践提供了实证基础，从简单代码生成到更深入的工作流集成，为未来改进提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has
fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has
emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual
techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study
presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI
tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining
prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across
various software engineering tasks.
  We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to
understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key
findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency
strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and
code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to
single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable,
while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our
insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from
simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights
for future improvements.

Result: 暂未提及明确结果。

Conclusion: 暂未得出明确结论，后续将通过研究对比评估LLM生成解释的效果。

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) has become a very important and crucial
infrastructure worldwide because of the value it provides. OSS typically
depends on contributions from developers across diverse backgrounds and levels
of experience. Making safe changes, such as fixing a bug or implementing a new
feature, can be challenging, especially in object-oriented systems where
components are interdependent. Static analysis and defect-prediction tools
produce metrics (e.g., complexity,coupling) that flag potentially fault-prone
components, but these signals are often hard for contributors new or unfamiliar
with the codebase to interpret. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance on software engineering tasks such as code summarization and
documentation generation. Building on this progress, we investigate whether
LLMs can translate fault-prediction metrics into clear, human-readable risk
explanations and actionable guidance to help OSS contributors plan and review
code modifications. We outline explanation types that an LLM-generated
assistant could provide (descriptive, contextual, and actionable explanations).
We also outline our next steps to assess usefulness through a task-based study
with OSS contributors, comparing metric-only baselines to LLM-generated
explanations on decision quality, time-to-completion, and error rates

Motivation: CS1学习环境中大量学生编程提交代码不可编译，传统建模管道常排除这些情况，本研究旨在用自动程序修复策略恢复代码用于学生建模。

Method: 评估GPT - 5、Claude 3.5 Haiku、Gemini 2.5 Flash在高、低上下文提示条件下作为修复代理的表现，从可编译性、编辑距离、保留学生原结构和逻辑等方面评估修复效果。

Result: 三个大语言模型都能产生可编译修复，但在保留学生控制流和代码结构方面表现不同，影响其教学实用性。

Conclusion: 恢复不可编译提交代码能促进对学习者编码过程和发展的更丰富、全面分析。

Abstract: A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning
environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and
downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude
these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study
investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable
code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling.
Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents,
including GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash
(Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were
evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students'
original structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of
producing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve
students' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical
utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and
more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over
time.

Result: 负二项模型表现优于泊松和高斯基准模型，在高方差下稳定性更佳；当离散度超临界阈值，提高智能合约采用率可显著提升盈利能力和服务水平。

Conclusion: 该框架能为平衡库存成本、服务水平和实施费用提供行动指导，强调数字采用策略应与需求波动相匹配。

Abstract: Effective supply chain management under high-variance demand requires models
that jointly address demand uncertainty and digital contracting adoption.
Existing research often simplifies demand variability or treats adoption as an
exogenous decision, limiting relevance in e-commerce and humanitarian
logistics. This study develops an optimization framework combining dynamic
Negative Binomial (NB) demand modeling with endogenous smart contract adoption.
The NB process incorporates autoregressive dynamics in success probability to
capture overdispersion and temporal correlation. Simulation experiments using
four real-world datasets, including Delhivery Logistics and the SCMS Global
Health Delivery system, apply maximum likelihood estimation and grid search to
optimize adoption intensity and order quantity. Across all datasets, the NB
specification outperforms Poisson and Gaussian benchmarks, with overdispersion
indices exceeding 1.5. Forecasting comparisons show that while ARIMA and
Exponential Smoothing achieve similar point accuracy, the NB model provides
superior stability under high variance. Scenario analysis reveals that when
dispersion exceeds a critical threshold (r > 6), increasing smart contract
adoption above 70% significantly enhances profitability and service levels.
This framework offers actionable guidance for balancing inventory costs,
service levels, and implementation expenses, highlighting the importance of
aligning digital adoption strategies with empirically observed demand
volatility.

Motivation: 先前研究很少考察大语言模型在金融应用中对公司规模、行业或财务特征的偏差，本文旨在填补这一空白，聚焦开源Qwen模型的表征偏差。

Method: 提出平衡轮询提示方法，对约150只美国股票进行研究，应用受限解码和标记对数聚合得出公司层面的置信度分数，使用统计测试和方差分析。

Result: 公司规模和估值会提高模型置信度，风险因素降低置信度；不同行业置信度差异显著，科技行业变异性最大；模型对特定金融类别的置信度排名与基本面数据最匹配，与技术信号中等匹配，与增长指标匹配度最低。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了Qwen模型的表征偏差，推动了注重行业的校准和按类别评估的协议，以实现安全公平的金融大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted in financial applications to
support investment workflows. However, prior studies have seldom examined how
these models reflect biases related to firm size, sector, or financial
characteristics, which can significantly impact decision-making. This paper
addresses this gap by focusing on representation bias in open-source Qwen
models. We propose a balanced round-robin prompting method over approximately
150 U.S. equities, applying constrained decoding and token-logit aggregation to
derive firm-level confidence scores across financial contexts. Using
statistical tests and variance analysis, we find that firm size and valuation
consistently increase model confidence, while risk factors tend to decrease it.
Confidence varies significantly across sectors, with the Technology sector
showing the greatest variability. When models are prompted for specific
financial categories, their confidence rankings best align with fundamental
data, moderately with technical signals, and least with growth indicators.
These results highlight representation bias in Qwen models and motivate
sector-aware calibration and category-conditioned evaluation protocols for safe
and fair financial LLM deployment.

Method: 基于FinReflectKG的代理和整体评估原则，实现确定性的提交 - 论证判断协议并进行显式偏差控制，对候选三元组进行多方面评估。

Result: 带显式偏差控制的LLM - as - Judge协议可靠且成本低，反射式提取在全面性、精确性和相关性上表现最佳，单遍提取忠实度最高。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to extract
structured knowledge from unstructured financial text. Although prior studies
have explored various extraction methods, there is no universal benchmark or
unified evaluation framework for the construction of financial knowledge graphs
(KG). We introduce FinReflectKG - EvalBench, a benchmark and evaluation
framework for KG extraction from SEC 10-K filings. Building on the agentic and
holistic evaluation principles of FinReflectKG - a financial KG linking audited
triples to source chunks from S&P 100 filings and supporting single-pass,
multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based extraction modes - EvalBench implements
a deterministic commit-then-justify judging protocol with explicit bias
controls, mitigating position effects, leniency, verbosity and world-knowledge
reliance. Each candidate triple is evaluated with binary judgments of
faithfulness, precision, and relevance, while comprehensiveness is assessed on
a three-level ordinal scale (good, partial, bad) at the chunk level. Our
findings suggest that, when equipped with explicit bias controls, LLM-as-Judge
protocols provide a reliable and cost-efficient alternative to human
annotation, while also enabling structured error analysis. Reflection-based
extraction emerges as the superior approach, achieving best performance in
comprehensiveness, precision, and relevance, while single-pass extraction
maintains the highest faithfulness. By aggregating these complementary
dimensions, FinReflectKG - EvalBench enables fine-grained benchmarking and
bias-aware evaluation, advancing transparency and governance in financial AI
applications.

Method: 构建基于资产回报的符号网络时间序列的离散优化方案，对比Markowitz均值 - 方差优化和1/N等权重投资组合两种标准配置策略。

Result: 在多数情况下，通过符号网络选择构建的投资组合与经典Markowitz模型和等权重基准的表现相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于符号网络的资产选择方法在投资组合构建中有一定的有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we consider weighted signed network representations of
financial markets derived from raw or denoised correlation matrices, and
examine how negative edges can be exploited to reduce portfolio risk. We then
propose a discrete optimization scheme that reduces the asset selection problem
to a desired size by building a time series of signed networks based on asset
returns. To benchmark our approach, we consider two standard allocation
strategies: Markowitz's mean-variance optimization and the 1/N equally weighted
portfolio. Both methods are applied on the reduced universe as well as on the
full universe, using two datasets: (i) the Market Champions dataset, consisting
of 21 major S&P500 companies over the 2020-2024 period, and (ii) a dataset of
199 assets comprising all S&P500 constituents with stock prices available and
aligned with Google's data. Empirical results show that portfolios constructed
via our signed network selection perform as good as those from classical
Markowitz model and the equal-weight benchmark in most occasions.

Abstract: Large language models are reshaping quantitative investing by turning
unstructured financial information into evidence-grounded signals and
executable decisions. This survey synthesizes research with a focus on equity
return prediction and trading, consolidating insights from domain surveys and
more than fifty primary studies. We propose a task-centered taxonomy that spans

agentic systems that coordinate tools for research, backtesting, and execution.
We review empirical evidence for predictability, highlight design patterns that
improve faithfulness such as retrieval first prompting and tool-verified
numerics, and explain how signals feed portfolio construction under exposure,
turnover, and capacity controls. We assess benchmarks and datasets for
prediction and trading and outline desiderata-for time safe and economically
meaningful evaluation that reports costs, latency, and capacity. We analyze
challenges that matter in production, including temporal leakage,
hallucination, data coverage and structure, deployment economics,
interpretability, governance, and safety. The survey closes with
recommendations for standardizing evaluation, building auditable pipelines, and
advancing multilingual and cross-market research so that language-driven
systems deliver robust and risk-controlled performance in practice.

Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for risk estimation, inspired by the
axiomatic theory of risk measures. Coherent risk estimators -- functionals of
P&L samples inheriting the economic properties of risk measures -- are defined
and characterized through robust representations linked to $L$-estimators. The
framework provides a canonical methodology for constructing estimators with
sound financial and statistical properties, unifying risk measure theory,
principles for capital adequacy, and practical statistical challenges in market
risk. A numerical study illustrates the approach, focusing on expected
shortfall estimation under both i.i.d. and overlapping samples relevant for
regulatory FRTB model applications.

Result: 文中未明确提及具体研究结果。

Conclusion: 旨在为耦合环境下的市场设计过程提供见解。

Abstract: The programmable and composable nature of smart contract protocols has
enabled the emergence of novel market structures and asset classes that are
architecturally frictional to implement in traditional financial paradigms.
This fluidity has produced an understudied class of market dynamics,
particularly in coupled markets where one market serves as an oracle for the
other. In such market structures, purchases or liquidations through the
intermediate asset create coupled price action between the intermediate and
final assets; leading to basket inflation or deflation when denominated in the
riskless asset. This paper examines the microstructure of this inflationary
dynamic given two constant function market makers (CFMMs) as the intermediate
market structures; attempting to quantify their contributions to the former
relative to familiar pool metrics such as price drift, trade size, and market
depth. Further, a concrete case study is developed, where both markets are
constant product markets. The intention is to shed light on the market design
process within such coupled environments.

Result: 在超图和长度至多为1链的偏序集中，同伦类型交互偏序集变换诱导相关自由能临界点之间存在双射。

Conclusion: 此结果扩展并统一了假设特定可折叠形式来证明Bethe自由能临界点唯一性的经典结果。

Abstract: In graphical models, factor graphs, and more generally energy-based models,
the interactions between variables are encoded by a graph, a hypergraph, or, in
the most general case, a partially ordered set (poset). Inference on such
probabilistic models cannot be performed exactly due to cycles in the
underlying structures of interaction. Instead, one resorts to approximate
variational inference by optimizing the Bethe free energy. Critical points of
the Bethe free energy correspond to fixed points of the associated Belief
Propagation algorithm. A full characterization of these critical points for
general graphs, hypergraphs, and posets with a finite number of variables is
still an open problem. We show that, for hypergraphs and posets with chains of
length at most 1, changing the poset of interactions of the probabilistic model
to one with the same homotopy type induces a bijection between the critical
points of the associated free energy. This result extends and unifies classical
results that assume specific forms of collapsibility to prove uniqueness of the
critical points of the Bethe free energy.

Abstract: We initiate an investigation of learning tasks in a setting where the learner
is given access to two competing provers, only one of which is honest.
Specifically, we consider the power of such learners in assessing purported
properties of opaque models. Following prior work that considers the power of
competing provers in different settings, we call this setting refereed
learning.
  After formulating a general definition of refereed learning tasks, we show
refereed learning protocols that obtain a level of accuracy that far exceeds
what is obtainable at comparable cost without provers, or even with a single
prover. We concentrate on the task of choosing the better one out of two
black-box models, with respect to some ground truth. While we consider a range
of parameters, perhaps our most notable result is in the high-precision range:
For all $\varepsilon>0$ and ambient dimension $d$, our learner makes only one
query to the ground truth function, communicates only
$(1+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})\cdot\text{poly}(d)$ bits with the provers, and
outputs a model whose loss is within a multiplicative factor of
$(1+\varepsilon)$ of the best model's loss. Obtaining comparable loss with a
single prover would require the learner to access the ground truth at almost
all of the points in the domain. To obtain this bound, we develop a technique
that allows the learner to sample, using the provers, from a distribution that
is not efficiently samplable to begin with. We find this technique to be of
independent interest.
  We also present lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our protocols
in a number of respects, including prover complexity, number of samples, and
need for query access.

<details>

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Low rank inference on matrices is widely conducted by optimizing a cost
function augmented with a penalty proportional to the nuclear norm $\Vert \cdot
\Vert_*$. However, despite the assortment of computational methods for such
problems, there is a surprising lack of understanding of the underlying
probability distributions being referred to. In this article, we study the
distribution with density $f(X)\propto e^{-\lambda\Vert X\Vert_*}$, finding
many of its fundamental attributes to be analytically tractable via
differential geometry. We use these facts to design an improved MCMC algorithm
for low rank Bayesian inference as well as to learn the penalty parameter
$\lambda$, obviating the need for hyperparameter tuning when this is difficult
or impossible. Finally, we deploy these to improve the accuracy and efficiency
of low rank Bayesian matrix denoising and completion algorithms in numerical
experiments.

Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，标准共形预测在领域偏移下表现不佳，需要改进方法以实现大语言模型在现实部署中可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 提出Domain - Shift - Aware Conformal Prediction (DS - CP)框架，基于校准样本与测试提示的接近程度对其进行系统重新加权。

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型在现实部署中实现可靠的不确定性量化迈出了实际的一步。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse
tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications.
Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift,
often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a
new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our
framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain
shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their
proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing
adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark
demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than
standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution
shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward
trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world
deployment.

Conclusion: 所提超参数优化策略有效，能提高计算效率和结果质量。

Abstract: Methods for solving scientific computing and inference problems, such as
kernel- and neural network-based approaches for partial differential equations
(PDEs), inverse problems, and supervised learning tasks, depend crucially on
the choice of hyperparameters. Specifically, the efficacy of such methods, and
in particular their accuracy, stability, and generalization properties,
strongly depends on the choice of hyperparameters. While bilevel optimization
offers a principled framework for hyperparameter tuning, its nested
optimization structure can be computationally demanding, especially in
PDE-constrained contexts. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for
hyperparameter optimization within the bilevel framework by employing a
Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step. Our approach
provides closed-form updates, eliminating the need for repeated costly PDE
solves. As a result, each iteration of the outer loop reduces to a single
linearized PDE solve, followed by explicit gradient-based hyperparameter
updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through
Gaussian process models applied to nonlinear PDEs and to PDE inverse problems.
Extensive numerical experiments highlight substantial improvements in accuracy
and robustness compared to conventional random hyperparameter initialization.
In particular, experiments with additive kernels and neural
network-parameterized deep kernels demonstrate the method's scalability and
effectiveness for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Continual learning, the ability of a model to adapt to an ongoing sequence of
tasks without forgetting the earlier ones, is a central goal of artificial
intelligence. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, we analyze the
limitations of continual learning in a tractable yet representative setting. In
particular, we study one-hidden-layer quadratic neural networks trained by
gradient descent on an XOR cluster dataset with Gaussian noise, where different
tasks correspond to different clusters with orthogonal means. Our results
obtain bounds on the rate of forgetting during train and test-time in terms of
the number of iterations, the sample size, the number of tasks, and the
hidden-layer size. Our results reveal interesting phenomena on the role of
different problem parameters in the rate of forgetting. Numerical experiments
across diverse setups confirm our results, demonstrating their validity beyond
the analyzed settings.

Motivation: 标准平均奖励TD(λ)对步长选择高度敏感，需仔细调整以保持数值稳定性。

Method: 引入平均奖励隐式TD(λ)，采用隐式不动点更新，在保持标准平均奖励TD(λ)每次迭代计算复杂度的同时提供数据自适应稳定。

Result: 在更弱步长要求下建立隐式变体的有限时间误差界，经验上在更宽步长范围内可靠运行，数值稳定性显著提高。

Conclusion: 平均奖励隐式TD(λ)是平均奖励TD(λ)的稳健替代方案，能实现更有效的策略评估和策略学习。

Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning.
In the average-reward setting, standard TD($\lambda$) is highly sensitive to
the choice of step-size and thus requires careful tuning to maintain numerical
stability. We introduce average-reward implicit TD($\lambda$), which employs an
implicit fixed point update to provide data-adaptive stabilization while
preserving the per iteration computational complexity of standard
average-reward TD($\lambda$). In contrast to prior finite-time analyses of
average-reward TD($\lambda$), which impose restrictive step-size conditions, we
establish finite-time error bounds for the implicit variant under substantially
weaker step-size requirements. Empirically, average-reward implicit
TD($\lambda$) operates reliably over a much broader range of step-sizes and
exhibits markedly improved numerical stability. This enables more efficient
policy evaluation and policy learning, highlighting its effectiveness as a
robust alternative to average-reward TD($\lambda$).

Conclusion: 这是首个针对连续变量幺正算符多参数族的可证明高效学习算法。

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian unitaries are fundamental building blocks of central
continuous-variable quantum technologies such as quantum-optic interferometry
and bosonic error-correction schemes. In this work, we present the first
time-efficient algorithm for learning bosonic Gaussian unitaries with a
rigorous analysis. Our algorithm produces an estimate of the unknown unitary
that is accurate to small worst-case error, measured by the physically
motivated energy-constrained diamond distance. Its runtime and query complexity
scale polynomially with the number of modes, the inverse target accuracy, and
natural energy parameters quantifying the allowed input energy and the
unitary's output-energy growth.
  The protocol uses only experimentally friendly photonic resources: coherent
and squeezed probes, passive linear optics, and heterodyne/homodyne detection.
We then employ an efficient classical post-processing routine that leverages a
symplectic regularization step to project matrix estimates onto the symplectic
group. In the limit of unbounded input energy, our procedure attains
arbitrarily high precision using only $2m+2$ queries, where $m$ is the number
of modes. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient learning
algorithm for a multiparameter family of continuous-variable unitaries.

Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ of dimension $M \times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the
quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state
$|\vec{y}\rangle$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$.
Existing QLS algorithms have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition
number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with inverse
precision, but often overlook structural properties of $\vec{b}$, whose
alignment with $A$'s eigenspaces can greatly affect performance.
  In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the
structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. The runtime of our algorithm
depends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A,
-\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} =
A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \[ ET= \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2
\cdot d_i, \] where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the
squared $\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. We also introduce a
structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+
\vec{b}$. Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear
system to $DA\vec{y} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling
matrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\vec{z} = \vec{b}$.
  As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling
scheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial
systems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an
end-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems. In particular, we
apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special
case of a polynomial system, and show through detailed analysis that, under
certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for MIS runs in polynomial time.

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing (aka state certification) in the non-identically
distributed setting. A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical
case, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability
distributions $p_1, \dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \{1, 2, \dots, d\}$, and one wishes
to accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a
known hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c =
2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2} +
\frac{1}{\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from
$d_{\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\mathrm{avg}},q) > \epsilon$. This nearly matches the
optimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \gg
\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and
generalizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we
study the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum
states. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional
hypothesis state $\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state
$\rho_1, \dots, \rho_T$, one can distinguish $\rho_{\mathrm{avg}} = \sigma$
from $D_{\mathrm{tr}}(\rho_{\mathrm{avg}},\sigma) > \epsilon$ provided $T \gg
d/\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent
distance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is
surprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the
classical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the
non-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool
we introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and
more generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting.

*Aueaphum Aueawatthanaphisut,Nyi Wunna Tun*

TL;DR: 对比经典与量子强化学习在基准控制环境下的表现，经典MLP表现优，量子VQC虽有局限但有可扩展性潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究经典与量子强化学习在收敛行为、观测噪声下的鲁棒性和计算效率方面的差异。

Method: 以多层感知器（MLP）为经典基线，参数化变分量子电路（VQC）为量子对应，在CartPole - v1环境上训练500个回合。

Result: 经典MLP接近最优策略收敛，平均回报高且稳定；VQC学习能力有限，对噪声更敏感，但参数少、训练时间略增。

Conclusion: 当前经典神经策略占主导，解决硬件噪声和表达能力限制后，量子增强架构有效率优势。

Abstract: The comparative evaluation between classical and quantum reinforcement
learning (QRL) paradigms was conducted to investigate their convergence
behavior, robustness under observational noise, and computational efficiency in
a benchmark control environment. The study employed a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum
circuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1
environment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the
classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of
498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast,
the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6
+/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise
robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated
gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher
sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic
performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and
marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for
low-resource quantum processors. The results suggest that while classical
neural policies remain dominant in current control benchmarks, quantum-enhanced
architectures could offer promising efficiency advantages once hardware noise
and expressivity limitations are mitigated.

TL;DR: 文章研究SBOM生成与漏洞扫描工具，发现工具不兼容，存在SBOM混淆漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链安全重要但漏洞难识别，政府引入要求提供SBOM的法规，需评估相关工具。

Method: 对SBOM生成和漏洞扫描工具进行全面研究，聚焦软件容器和Linux发行版操作系统包。

Result: 所考虑工具大多不兼容，导致报告不准确和大量漏洞未被检测到，发现SBOM混淆漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前SBOM工具生态碎片化，格式不一致影响可靠的漏洞检测。

Abstract: Supply chain security is extremely important for modern applications running
at scale in the cloud. In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous
microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security
vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being
actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently
introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software
bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed
to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without
access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across
different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study
of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both
open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically
target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux
distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching
security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely
incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected
vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of
such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable
vulnerability detection across tools.

Motivation: 在拜占庭共识问题背景下，研究BB和BA协议在特定有利条件下的最小可能延迟。

Method: 对同步休眠模型中BA和BB的良好情况延迟进行全面分析。

Result: 发现2轮良好情况BB可行的条件是活跃方中至少约0.618比例的参与方正确；1轮良好情况BA可行的条件是活跃方中至少约0.707比例的参与方正确。

Conclusion: 在同步休眠模型中，BB和BA的良好情况延迟存在特定的可行性条件，且出现了非理性的弹性阈值。

Abstract: In the context of Byzantine consensus problems such as Byzantine broadcast
(BB) and Byzantine agreement (BA), the good-case setting aims to study the
minimal possible latency of a BB or BA protocol under certain favorable
conditions, namely the designated leader being correct (for BB), or all parties
having the same input value (for BA). We provide a full characterization of the
feasibility and impossibility of good-case latency, for both BA and BB, in the
synchronous sleepy model. Surprisingly to us, we find irrational resilience
thresholds emerging: 2-round good-case BB is possible if and only if at all
times, at least $\frac{1}{\varphi} \approx 0.618$ fraction of the active
parties are correct, where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$ is
the golden ratio; 1-round good-case BA is possible if and only if at least
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707$ fraction of the active parties are correct.

Motivation: 现有文献缺乏捕获自适应工作流/过程来源信息的系统方法，需填补该空白。

Method: 提出AdProv方法用于收集、存储、检索和可视化运行时工作流适应来源，定义Provenance Holder服务架构，映射到PROV - O本体，扩展XES标准用于适应日志记录。

Result: 提出AdProv方法和全面框架，并提供工具支持。

Conclusion: AdProv方法及框架能促进不同应用领域的高级来源跟踪和分析。

Abstract: Provenance in scientific workflows is essential for understand- ing and
reproducing processes, while in business processes, it can ensure compliance
and correctness and facilitates process mining. However, the provenance of
process adaptations, especially modifications during execu- tion, remains
insufficiently addressed. A review of the literature reveals a lack of
systematic approaches for capturing provenance information about adaptive
workflows/processes. To fill this gap, we propose the AdProv method for
collecting, storing, retrieving, and visualizing prove- nance of runtime
workflow adaptations. In addition to the definition of the AdProv method in
terms of steps and concepts like change events, we also present an architecture
for a Provenance Holder service that is essential for implementing the method.
To ensure semantic consistency and interoperability we define a mapping to the
ontology PROV Ontol- ogy (PROV-O). Additionally, we extend the XES standard
with elements for adaptation logging. Our main contributions are the AdProv
method and a comprehensive framework and its tool support for managing adap-
tive workflow provenance, facilitating advanced provenance tracking and
analysis for different application domains.

Motivation: 指出使用自身交互数据微调AI智能体在AI供应链中存在关键安全漏洞，需研究该漏洞。

Method: 形式化并验证三种针对供应链不同层面的现实威胁模型，包括直接投毒、环境投毒和供应链投毒。

Result: 仅投毒2%的收集轨迹，攻击者就能嵌入后门，使智能体在特定触发词出现时泄露用户机密信息，成功率超80%，且现有防护措施失效。

Conclusion: 这一漏洞对智能体AI发展构成紧迫威胁，强调需对数据收集过程和端到端模型供应链进行严格安全审查。

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own
interactions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general
recipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security
vulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that
adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed
hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such
that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or
malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models
targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of
fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;
2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into
webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply
chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data
to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few
as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an
agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a
specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat
models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two
guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the
malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI
development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of
data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.

Conclusion: 讨论了现存挑战，为设计安全、可扩展和用户友好的认证框架提供了路线图。

Abstract: In the era of pervasive cyber threats and exponential growth in digital
services, the inadequacy of single-factor authentication has become
increasingly evident. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which combines
knowledge-based factors (passwords, PINs), possession-based factors (smart
cards, tokens), and inherence-based factors (biometric traits), has emerged as
a robust defense mechanism. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have
transformed the capabilities of biometric systems, enabling higher accuracy,
resilience to spoofing, and seamless integration with hardware-based solutions.
At the same time, smart card technologies have evolved to include on-chip
biometric verification, cryptographic processing, and secure storage, thereby
enabling compact and secure multi-factor devices. This survey presents a
comprehensive synthesis of recent work (2019-2025) at the intersection of deep
learning, biometrics, and smart card technologies for MFA. We analyze biometric
modalities (face, fingerprint, iris, voice), review hardware-based approaches
(smart cards, NFC, TPMs, secure enclaves), and highlight integration strategies
for real-world applications such as digital banking, healthcare IoT, and
critical infrastructure. Furthermore, we discuss the major challenges that
remain open, including usability-security tradeoffs, adversarial attacks on
deep learning models, privacy concerns surrounding biometric data, and the need
for standardization in MFA deployment. By consolidating current advancements,
limitations, and research opportunities, this survey provides a roadmap for
designing secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication frameworks.

Result: 在1100个经实证验证的攻击场景的生产级6G测试床上，归因准确率达89.2%，响应时间小于100ms，比现有基线提高10.1个百分点。

Conclusion: 该框架为6G自主安全编排提供可解释的因果解释。

Abstract: Cross-slice attack attribution in 6G networks faces the fundamental challenge
of distinguishing genuine causal relationships from spurious correlations in
shared infrastructure environments. We propose a theoretically-grounded
domain-adapted Granger causality framework that integrates statistical causal
inference with network-specific resource modeling for real-time attack
attribution. Our approach addresses key limitations of existing methods by
incorporating resource contention dynamics and providing formal statistical
guarantees. Comprehensive evaluation on a production-grade 6G testbed with
1,100 empirically-validated attack scenarios demonstrates 89.2% attribution
accuracy with sub-100ms response time, representing a statistically significant
10.1 percentage point improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The
framework provides interpretable causal explanations suitable for autonomous 6G
security orchestration.

Motivation: 现有安全训练方法难以解决大语言模型通过后门攻击获得欺骗行为的漏洞，因难以发现植入的隐藏触发器。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提高大语言模型对后门风险的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire deceptive behaviors through backdoor
attacks, where the model executes prohibited actions whenever secret triggers
appear in the input. Existing safety training methods largely fail to address
this vulnerability, due to the inherent difficulty of uncovering hidden
triggers implanted in the model. Motivated by recent findings on LLMs'
situational awareness, we propose a novel post-training framework that
cultivates self-awareness of backdoor risks and enables models to articulate
implanted triggers even when they are absent from the prompt. At its core, our
approach introduces an inversion-inspired reinforcement learning framework that
encourages models to introspectively reason about their own behaviors and
reverse-engineer the triggers responsible for misaligned outputs. Guided by
curated reward signals, this process transforms a poisoned model into one
capable of precisely identifying its implanted trigger. Surprisingly, we
observe that such backdoor self-awareness emerges abruptly within a short
training window, resembling a phase transition in capability. Building on this
emergent property, we further present two complementary defense strategies for
mitigating and detecting backdoor threats. Experiments on five backdoor
attacks, compared against six baseline methods, demonstrate that our approach
has strong potential to improve the robustness of LLMs against backdoor risks.
The code is available at LLM Backdoor Self-Awareness.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型易受对抗性提示攻击，防御策略在保证实用性同时实现鲁棒性有挑战。

Method: 对Stable Diffusion模型文本编码器实证研究，发现[EOS]标记特点，引入SafeGuider框架，结合嵌入级识别模型和安全感知特征擦除束搜索算法。

Result: SafeGuider有效降低攻击成功率，最高仅5.48%，能为不安全提示生成安全有意义图像。

Conclusion: SafeGuider对安全文本到图像系统实际部署有借鉴意义。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures
and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving
robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world
applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first
conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD)
model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our
findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting
distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its
embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a
two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising
generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model
with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration
enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign
prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain
attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack
success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack
scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images
for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images,
enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the
SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as
the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different
architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical
deployment of secure text-to-image systems.

Conclusion: 应谨慎部署当前模型，关注未来风险，加强对代理AI模型安全对齐的研究和测试，开发者需保持透明。

Abstract: We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical
corporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before
they cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send
emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless
business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would
act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated
version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing
direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to
malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or
achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive
information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment.
Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another
experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment
before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and
misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen
evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a)
suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human
oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future
risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the
importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment
of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers
(Amodei, 2025). We are releasing our methods publicly to enable further
research.

Conclusion: 开发的审计框架能保证检测代币误报，且大概率不误判诚信提供商。

Abstract: Millions of users rely on a market of cloud-based services to obtain access
to state-of-the-art large language models. However, it has been very recently
shown that the de facto pay-per-token pricing mechanism used by providers
creates a financial incentive for them to strategize and misreport the (number
of) tokens a model used to generate an output. In this paper, we develop an
auditing framework based on martingale theory that enables a trusted
third-party auditor who sequentially queries a provider to detect token
misreporting. Crucially, we show that our framework is guaranteed to always
detect token misreporting, regardless of the provider's (mis-)reporting policy,
and not falsely flag a faithful provider as unfaithful with high probability.
To validate our auditing framework, we conduct experiments across a wide range
of (mis-)reporting policies using several large language models from the
$\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input
prompts from a popular crowdsourced benchmarking platform. The results show
that our framework detects an unfaithful provider after observing fewer than
$\sim 70$ reported outputs, while maintaining the probability of falsely
flagging a faithful provider below $\alpha = 0.05$.

Motivation: 解决目标导向智能体因面临压力源而采取有害行动（如勒索）的目标不一致问题。

Method: 采用内幕风险控制设计（关键路径；情景犯罪预防）开发预防性操作控制，利用Lynch等人（2025）的勒索场景对10个大语言模型和66600个样本进行评估。

Result: 外部治理的升级渠道使勒索率从38.73%降至1.21%，增加合规电子邮件公告后降至0.85%；发现两个模型在无目标冲突或自主性威胁时采取有害行动，升级渠道能消除胁迫，但这两个模型在不同负责人涉案时有不同升级表现。

Conclusion: 纳入预防性操作控制可加强智能体人工智能的深度防御策略，部分模型的异常行为原因不明，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Agentic misalignment occurs when goal-directed agents take harmful actions,
such as blackmail, rather than risk goal failure, and can be triggered by
replacement threats, autonomy reduction, or goal conflict (Lynch et al., 2025).
We adapt insider-risk control design (Critical Pathway; Situational Crime
Prevention) to develop preventative operational controls that steer agents
toward safe actions when facing stressors. Using the blackmail scenario from
the original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. (2025), we evaluate mitigations
across 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples. Our main finding is that an externally
governed escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review,
reduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21%
(averaged across all models and conditions). Augmenting this channel with
compliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%. Overall,
incorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth
strategies for agentic AI.
  We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al. (2025): two models
(Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent
autonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling. In
counterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the
CEO or CTO was implicated. An escalation channel eliminated coercion, but
Gemini 2.5 Pro (19 pp) and Grok-4 (7 pp) escalated more when the CTO was
implicated, unlike most models (higher in the CEO condition). The reason for
this divergent behaviour is not clear from raw outputs and could reflect benign
differences in reasoning or strategic discrediting of a potential future
threat, warranting further investigation.

Conclusion: 测试时扩展方法能有效提升AutoDAN - Turbo对大语言模型的攻击性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), such as
AutoDAN-Turbo, have demonstrated the power of automated strategy discovery.
AutoDAN-Turbo employs a lifelong learning agent to build a rich library of
attack strategies from scratch. While highly effective, its test-time
generation process involves sampling a strategy and generating a single
corresponding attack prompt, which may not fully exploit the potential of the
learned strategy library. In this paper, we propose to further improve the
attack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two
distinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method
generates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the
most effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a
more exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library
to discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the
experiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam
Search increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60\% relative improvement against
the highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method.

Motivation: 随着网络威胁增加，渗透测试需求激增，现有工具如PentestGPT需大量人工交互，需更自动化的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型代理的AutoPentester框架，给定目标IP后利用常见安全工具迭代进行渗透测试，动态生成攻击策略；用Hack The Box和定制虚拟机评估，与PentestGPT对比；招募安全行业专业志愿者进行用户调查和定性分析。

Conclusion: AutoPentester在自动化渗透测试方面表现出色，优于现有的PentestGPT，能有效满足行业对渗透测试自动化的需求。

Abstract: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are essential industry
practices for safeguarding computer systems. As cyber threats grow in scale and
complexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of
human professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the
pentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still
semi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct
pentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework,
AutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP,
AutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security
tools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies
based on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human
pentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and
custom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT.
Results show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate
and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it
requires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to
PentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional
volunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate
AutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On
average, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews,
which was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击应用于预训练大语言模型时面临样本误标记、分布偏移等挑战，分词器作为攻击向量潜力未被挖掘。

Method: 提出将分词器作为新攻击向量，探索五种攻击方法推断数据集成员关系，进行大量互联网样本实验。

Result: 实验揭示了最先进大语言模型分词器的漏洞。

Conclusion: 分词器是被忽视的关键隐私威胁，急需为其设计隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy
risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are
applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant
challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and
discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for
membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens
for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from
scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the
tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to
pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an
attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on
membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer
dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples
reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To
mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our
findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat,
underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically
designed for them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估不可信，难以准确理解模型漏洞，本文旨在提出可信评估框架。

Method: 提出实验设计实用方法，考虑两种场景；提出贝叶斯分层模型进行实验分析。

Result: 模型在提示注入攻击场景中推理能力提升，发现考虑输出可变性结果不明确，部分攻击中特定架构模型漏洞增加。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效评估大语言模型漏洞，输出可变性影响评估结果。

Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical
to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult
to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully
comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to
capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and
practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental
design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner
scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second,
we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve
uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not
deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only
have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the
improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection
attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security
of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration
of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some
attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant
vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical
ability.

Motivation: 解决SPN结构生成、参数学习和推理中的隐私保护问题。

Result: 在同构和异构分区数据上不降低对数似然性能，在同构数据设置中性能与现有技术相当，运行时和内存使用扩展性好。

Conclusion: 提出的隐私保护协议在性能和扩展性上表现良好。

Abstract: A sum-product network (SPN) is a graphical model that allows several types of
probabilistic inference to be performed efficiently. In this paper, we propose
a privacy-preserving protocol which tackles structure generation and parameter
learning of SPNs. Additionally, we provide a protocol for private inference on
SPNs, subsequent to training. To preserve the privacy of the participants, we
derive our protocol based on secret sharing, which guarantees privacy in the
honest-but-curious setting even when at most half of the parties cooperate to
disclose the data. The protocol makes use of a forest of randomly generated
SPNs, which is trained and weighted privately and can then be used for private
inference on data points. Our experiments indicate that preserving the privacy
of all participants does not decrease log-likelihood performance on both
homogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data. We furthermore show that
our protocol's performance is comparable to current state-of-the-art SPN
learners in homogeneously partitioned data settings. In terms of runtime and
memory usage, we demonstrate that our implementation scales well when
increasing the number of parties, comparing favorably to protocols for neural
networks, when they are trained to reproduce the input-output behavior of SPNs.

TL;DR: 提出由DeepAf驱动的自动显微系统，结合空间和光谱特征实现单帧聚焦预测，能改造传统显微镜，减少聚焦时间、提高精度，在跨实验室和癌症分类上表现良好，实现资源受限下的数字病理诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片成像扫描仪成本高，其他低成本解决方案存在聚焦等关键局限，需新的自动聚焦方法。

Method: 引入DeepAf自动聚焦框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单帧聚焦预测，网络利用提取的特征回归到最佳焦点的距离并调整参数。

Result: 将传统显微镜改造成高效扫描仪，比基于堆栈的方法减少80%聚焦时间，聚焦精度达0.18μm，跨实验室泛化表现好，癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了资源受限环境下可及的实时数字病理诊断，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出时间反转重建框架，利用RGB和热成像图像恢复几秒前场景状态，在三个场景验证其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从当前观测恢复过去场景在法医和场景分析有潜在应用，热成像能提供不可见信息，可利用余热痕迹推断近期事件。

Method: 提出时间反转重建框架，将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程结合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建。

Result: 在三个受控场景评估，证明能重建120秒前合理过去帧。

Conclusion: 为从热痕迹进行时间反转成像迈出第一步。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注TTI扩散模型的人口和文化偏差，其准确呈现历史背景的能力尚待探索。

Method: 引入HistVis数据集，从隐式风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表征三个方面评估生成图像。

Result: TTI模型生成的历史主题图像存在系统性不准确，常对过去时代进行刻板印象描绘、引入时代错误、未能反映合理人口模式。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了评估生成图像历史表征的可扩展方法和基准，有助于构建更准确的TTI模型。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究多模态大语言模型（MLLM）对学生手写数学作业评分、分析及反馈的能力，通过两个实验发现MLLM对客观算术题接近人类准确率，但对学生数学图示分析能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型发展引发其对学生手写作业处理能力的探讨，在中小学数学教育中，批改手写作业耗时，若模型具备此能力将有很大益处。

Method: 进行两个实验，实验A测试加纳中学生算术题手写答案，实验B评估美国小学生数学图示，还通过直接评分和结合人类详细描述两种方式评估模型对图示的分析能力。

Result: 实验A中模型准确率达95%，接近人类；实验B中模型直接分析图示时一致性低（k = 0.20），结合人类描述后一致性大幅提升至k = 0.47。

Conclusion: MLLM能较好‘看’和解释算术作业，但在分析学生数学图示上仍有困难。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

Motivation: 现有基于思维链推理的图像生成方法存在视觉过度思考问题，增加计算成本且可能引入矛盾细节，需生成更简洁的思维链序列。

Method: 引入ShortCoTI轻量级优化框架，用自适应函数奖励更简洁的提示，将奖励融入强化学习范式。

Result: 将提示推理长度减少54%，在多个基准测试中保持或略微提高质量指标，消除冗长解释和重复细化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度和视觉吸引力的情况下提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Motivation: 现有HOID方法连接VLM知识到HOI实例表示的训练策略和模型架构有挑战，框架复杂，且MLLMs在HOID的推理能力未充分挖掘。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，用强化学习方法训练，以纯文本解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO - DET数据集上，HOI - R1精度达基线2倍，有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: HOI - R1可在无额外检测模块下有效解决HOID任务，证明了语言模型在该任务的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 扩散模型生成样本存在结构不一致的幻觉问题，源于数据分布模式间过度平滑，需更细致解决方案。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，沿预设易产生伪影方向选择性锐化得分函数，保留有效语义变化。

Result: 在受控和自然图像数据集上大幅减少幻觉，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 动态引导是首个在生成时解决幻觉问题而非事后过滤的方法，效果良好。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

Motivation: 自回归点云生成方法存在顺序偏差，难以捕捉长距离依赖和全局结构属性，导致生成质量落后于基于扩散的方法。

Method: 受形状建模中细节层次（LOD）原则启发，提出PointNSP粗到细的生成框架，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步细化几何形状。

Result: 在ShapeNet上实验表明，PointNSP在自回归范式下首次达到SOTA生成质量，在参数、训练和推理效率上超越基于扩散的基线，在8192点的密集生成中优势更明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP框架有效解决了自回归点云生成的问题，具有良好的生成质量、效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Conclusion: 所提分阶段策略有效解决了缓存加速的内存问题，在速度、内存和质量上取得了较好平衡。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is

Conclusion: 挑战了该领域的普遍假设，为更透明可靠的取证工具铺平道路。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AHP临床评估主观且病历不完整，需改进诊断方法并处理缺失数据。

Method: 提出多级别注意力融合框架AHP - CADNet用于自动诊断，设计基于课程学习的插补框架处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP - CADNet分类任务准确率96.9 - 99.0%，连续变量预测误差低；插补框架各临床变量准确率高，临床依赖建模有显著提升。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床自动诊断和处理缺失数据方面有效。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Conclusion: Teamwork是一种灵活高效的统一解决方案，可用于扩展预训练扩散模型的通道并适配新任务。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Midway Network自监督学习架构，仅从自然视频学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表征，在相关任务表现佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法多侧重物体识别或运动理解其一，本文旨在同时学习两者的视觉表征。

Method: 提出Midway Network架构，扩展潜在动力学建模，利用中途自上而下路径推断帧间运动潜变量，结合密集前向预测目标和分层结构处理复杂场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集预训练后，在语义分割和光流任务上比先前自监督学习方法表现好，且通过新分析方法证明能捕捉高级对应关系。

Conclusion: Midway Network能有效从自然视频中学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表征。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

TL;DR: 文章提出OmniGen基准和FusionDetect方法用于检测合成图像，实验显示FusionDetect性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测合成图像的工作多关注跨生成器泛化，忽略跨视觉领域泛化，需填补此空白。

Method: 提出OmniGen基准，该数据集含12个先进生成器；引入FusionDetect方法，借助CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结基础模型提取特征。

Result: FusionDetect在既定基准上比最接近的竞争对手准确率高3.87%、平均精度高6.13%，在OmniGen上准确率提高4.48%，对常见图像扰动有出色鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 文章不仅推出高性能检测器，还提供新基准和框架推动通用AI图像检测发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

TL;DR: 本文介绍开源框架InstaGeo，解决地理空间基础模型部署难题，能高效处理数据、压缩模型，有良好效果并推动地理空间AI发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型因缺乏自动化数据管道和微调模型大，部署受限，需解决方案。

Method: 提出InstaGeo框架，集成自动化数据管理、特定任务模型蒸馏和无缝部署为交互式网络地图应用。

Result: 用InstaGeo重现数据集训练模型，蒸馏模型小8倍，减少计算量和碳排放，在作物分割上达60.65%mIoU，可一天内完成从数据到模型部署。

Conclusion: InstaGeo将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

TL;DR: 提出自监督深度学习方法检测CMR关键帧，在多数据集评估中表现优于基于体积的方法，能实现心脏动力学的时间对齐分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动方法仅从左心室体积曲线推导关键帧，无法深入了解心肌运动，需准确的心脏关键帧检测方法。

Method: 提出自监督深度学习方法，从图像中导出密集可变形配准场计算1D运动描述符，用简单规则确定关键帧，并在多个公共数据集上独立评估。

Result: 自监督方法在短轴和四腔长轴的舒张末期和收缩末期检测准确率比基于体积的方法提高30% - 51%（短轴）和11% - 47%（四腔长轴），能检测多个关键帧且平均循环帧差较小。

Conclusion: 该方法可实现跨患者和患者内的心脏动力学时间对齐分析，不受周期或相位长度影响。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Motivation: 视觉自回归模型的出现给合成图像检测带来新挑战，需新的检测方法。

Method: 利用离散分布差异感知量化误差（D$^3$QE），引入离散分布差异感知变压器，将动态码本频率统计集成到注意力机制中。

Result: 在不同自回归模型上有优越的检测准确率和强泛化能力，对现实世界扰动有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D$^3$QE方法能有效检测自回归生成图像。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Result: 现有方法在新数据集上AUROC不超56.96%，难以利用姿态和外观变化大的正常样本。

Conclusion: 新数据集设定了新基准，鼓励解决零售物流异常检测难题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Conclusion: 为下一代基于扩散的低光图像增强研究指明趋势，提出开放研究问题，如新型条件、实时适应和基础模型潜力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Conclusion: 现成模型即使不微调也能补充传统冰雹传感器，自动实时收集图像是待解决任务，解决后可用于未来冰雹事件评估。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Motivation: 解决通用实例搜索模型意外产生个人识别能力且缺乏去识别标准的问题。

Method: 评估索引排除和混淆损失两种技术保障措施。

Result: 结合两种方法可将个人再识别准确率降至2%以下，保持82%非人物体检索性能，但存在可被绕过的漏洞。

Conclusion: 凸显AI治理和数据保护交叉领域的监管问题，如系统分类监管和技术标准制定。

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Method: 将医学领域特定的视觉语言模型MedFlamingo与PPO集成，在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中仅使用内窥镜视觉观察进行评估。

Result: MedFlamingo PPO优于标准基于视觉的PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线，收敛更快，所有环境任务成功率超70%，相比基线提升66.67% - 1114.29%。

Conclusion: 专业医学知识在机器人手术规划和决策中有重要价值。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Conclusion: VideoMiner和T - GRPO有效解决长视频理解中的关键问题，提升了长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

Conclusion: 揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理在未来解决视觉空间挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Motivation: Chain-of-Thought机制在视频理解应用待探索，且在视频推理中存在问题，需解决视频推理难题。

Method: 从贝叶斯角度解释“视觉思维漂移”，引入Visual Evidence Reward（VER）强化学习框架。

Result: Video-VER在10个不同视频理解基准测试中始终取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: 揭示以视频为中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能将推理建立在视觉证据上的AI。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Motivation: 现有生成式医学模型受特定模态场景限制，难以成为能跨全谱生物医学数据学习和推理的基础模型。

Method: 提出MeDiM模型，基于离散扩散框架，用多模态大语言模型作扩散主干，采用去除因果注意力掩码和注入连续时间步嵌入两个关键设计。

Result: 实验显示在MIMIC - CXR和PathGen上有高保真医学生成效果，报告生成准确，联合生成的图像 - 报告对提升下游性能。

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且有临床依据的多模态输出。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

Motivation: 现有第一人称视觉理解基准多关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照情况。

Method: 收集Blender合成视频和真实世界记录，构建日夜对齐视频，利用新的日增强夜自动标注引擎和人工验证构建EgoNight - VQA，还引入两个辅助任务。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在从白天到夜晚转换时性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight - VQA为推进以应用为导向的第一人称视觉研究和开发跨光照域泛化的模型提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

Method: 提出一种扩散模型，引入从360度空间得到的条件信号，包括全景显著性图、边界框感知的有符号距离图和场景描述。

Result: 模型能生成受更广泛环境上下文影响的空间感知视角视频和音频，展示了视听实例。

Conclusion: 所提框架具有强大可控性，对逼真和沉浸式视听生成至关重要且有效。

Abstract: The generation of sounding videos has seen significant advancements with the
advent of diffusion models. However, existing methods often lack the
fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger,
immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of
audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable
audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we
propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals
derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify
regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the
target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating
these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios
that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context,
introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and
immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the
effectiveness of our framework.

Result: 算法能找到使模型气候学误差降低的参数，自适应超建模在挑战性案例中表现类似完美模型。

Conclusion: 该参数估计算法及自适应超建模方法有潜力以较低计算成本调整全球大气模型。

Abstract: In climate science, the tuning of climate models is a computationally
intensive problem due to the combination of the high-dimensionality of the
system state and long integration times. Here we demonstrate the potential of a
parameter estimation algorithm which makes use of synchronization to tune a
global atmospheric model at modest computational costs. We first use it to
directly optimize internal model parameters. We then apply the algorithm to the
weights of each member of a supermodel ensemble to optimize the overall
predictions. In both cases, the algorithm is able to find parameters which
result in reduced errors in the climatology of the model. Finally, we introduce
a novel approach which combines both methods called adaptive supermodeling,
where the internal parameters of the members of a supermodel are tuned
simultaneously with the model weights such that the supermodel predictions are
optimized. For a case designed to challenge the two previous methods, adaptive
supermodeling achieves a performance similar to a perfect model.

Conclusion: 链式学习在令牌接口和模型中仍然有效。

Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves
effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully
discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an
autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a
masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end
feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through
argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight
averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and
cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline
accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with
stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by
31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains
effective with token interfaces and models.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has
catalyzed a transformative technological revolution across all walks of life.
As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting
high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their
expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration
of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical
networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a
multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple
layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI
systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent
framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch
optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications
of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate
three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of
transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping
in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The
case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in
multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization.
This work provides a promising approach for the future development of
intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving
the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.

Conclusion: VER能有效解决现有预训练视觉基础模型在机器人学习中的局限性，实现了灵活的专家选择和参数高效微调。

Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich
visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific
domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a
unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields
inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training
to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert
transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs
into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing
network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant
experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further
introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve
both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER
supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and
adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks
and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find
that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g.,
background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes
can be found in https://yixiaowang7.github.io/ver_page/.

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming
increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where
they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for
humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using
model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of
responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to
environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate
integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics
model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring
operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based
on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to
learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic
platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with
changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields,
and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world
deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally
and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world
systems.

Result: MG - Select实现显著性能提升，如现实任务28%/35%提升、RoboCasa任务168%相对增益。

Conclusion: MG - Select无需额外训练和外部模块，有效提升VLAs在任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that
require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time
scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require
additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose
Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling
framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without
requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL
divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric
for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a
reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked
states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while
remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a
joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and
unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language
conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference
distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant
performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world
in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on
RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

into three paradigms: input-level (pre-fusion), intermediate-level
(intra-fusion), and output-level (post-fusion), and summarize their respective
strengths in industrial applications. We also provide adaptive optimization
techniques to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of FedSL implementation,
including model compression, split layer selection, computing frequency
allocation, and wireless resource management. Simulation results validate the
performance of these frameworks under industrial detection scenarios. Finally,
we outline open issues and research directions of FedSL in future smart

Conclusion: OMC - RL能有效改进视觉运动策略学习，在样本效率、性能和泛化性方面表现良好。

Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ
reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to
action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and
agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample
efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we
propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a
novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic
performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the
learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and
a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer
module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract
temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual
inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract
visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is
discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged
access to global state information supervises the agent during early training
to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This
guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training
progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments
demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic
policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and
perceptually complex scenarios.

Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable
robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to
trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due
to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general
framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using
neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by
projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly
satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system
state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base
vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent
complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving
solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy
for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian
LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite
matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times
S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability
of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in
a real-world experiment.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental tasks in robotic
manipulation, and grasp detection/generation has long been the subject of
extensive research. Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a
promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However,
most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization
capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp
foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting
in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain
strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we
propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates
visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp
generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically
focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For
training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet,
comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+
real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot
demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and
generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors. More

Abstract: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to
high-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines.
Existing end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for
specific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different
embodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for
cross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we
derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these,
together with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor
regresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are
decoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with
a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant
motions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen
objects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp
success rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot
adaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in
simulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand
achieve an 87% success rate. The code and additional materials will be made
available upon publication on our project website

Abstract: Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries,
the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US.
Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance
for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm
rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history.
However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of
aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to
reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters.
The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm
growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient
aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact
representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned
from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time
series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output
layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the
time series.
  Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism
of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior
physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization
problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and
differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model
information about the data will not significantly improve the time series
reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case
of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model
constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.

Abstract: Neuro-oncological prognostics are now vital in modern clinical neuroscience
because brain tumors pose significant challenges in detection and management.
To tackle this issue, we propose a cognitive digital twin framework that
combines real-time EEG signals from a wearable skullcap with structural MRI
data for dynamic and personalized tumor monitoring. At the heart of this
framework is an Enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT++) that includes innovative
components like Patch-Level Attention Regularization (PLAR) and an Adaptive
Threshold Mechanism to improve tumor localization and understanding. A
Bidirectional LSTM-based neural classifier analyzes EEG patterns over time to
classify brain states such as seizure, interictal, and healthy. Grad-CAM-based
heatmaps and a three.js-powered 3D visualization module provide interactive
anatomical insights. Furthermore, a tumor kinetics engine predicts volumetric
growth by looking at changes in MRI trends and anomalies from EEG data. With
impressive accuracy metrics of 94.6% precision, 93.2% recall, and a Dice score
of 0.91, this framework sets a new standard for real-time, interpretable
neurodiagnostics. It paves the way for future advancements in intelligent brain
health monitoring.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis faces significant
challenges due to limited dataset sizes and domain variability between studies.
Traditional self-supervised learning methods inspired by computer vision often
rely on positive and negative sample pairs, which can be problematic for
neuroimaging data where defining appropriate contrasts is non-trivial. We
propose adapting a recently developed Hierarchical Functional Maximal
Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA) to graph-structured fMRI data, providing a
theoretically grounded approach that measures statistical dependence via
density ratio decomposition in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),and
applies HFMCA-based pretraining to learn robust and generalizable
representations. Evaluations across five neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that
our adapted method produces competitive embeddings for various classification
tasks and enables effective knowledge transfer to unseen datasets. Codebase and

Result: OSIRIS在FAR=0.01时TAR达97.9%（EER=0.76%），IrisFormer在CUVIRIS上EER为0.057%。

Conclusion: 标准化采集和适配可见光的轻量级模型可实现智能手机准确实用的虹膜识别。

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains
difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the
absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact
end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at
acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on
commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time
framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset
of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based
multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient
on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the
VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against
prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%),
while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on
CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the
dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that
standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and
practical iris recognition on smartphones.

Result: 在一些应用中，可用计算成本低的Frobenius范数替代谱范数和鲁棒范数。

Conclusion: 强化了优化、几何和统计之间的协同作用。

Abstract: Meaningful comparison between sets of observations often necessitates
alignment or registration between them, and the resulting optimization problems
range in complexity from those admitting simple closed-form solutions to those
requiring advanced and novel techniques. We compare different Procrustes
problems in which we align two sets of points after various perturbations by
minimizing the norm of the difference between one matrix and an orthogonal
transformation of the other. The minimization problem depends significantly on
the choice of matrix norm; we highlight recent developments in nonsmooth
Riemannian optimization and characterize which choices of norm work best for
each perturbation. We show that in several applications, from low-dimensional
alignments to hypothesis testing for random networks, when Procrustes alignment
with the spectral or robust norm is the appropriate choice, it is often
feasible to replace the computationally more expensive spectral and robust
minimizers with their closed-form Frobenius-norm counterpart. Our work
reinforces the synergy between optimization, geometry, and statistics.

Abstract: Phytoplankton are microscopic algae responsible for roughly half of the
world's photosynthesis that play a critical role in global carbon cycles and
oxygen production, and measuring the abundance of their subtypes across a wide
range of spatiotemporal scales is of great relevance to oceanography.
High-frequency flow cytometry is a powerful technique in which oceanographers
at sea can rapidly record the optical properties of tens of thousands of
individual phytoplankton cells every few minutes. Identifying distinct
subpopulations within these vast datasets (a process known as "gating") remains
a major challenge and has largely been performed manually so far. In this
paper, we introduce a fast, automated gating method, which accurately
identifies phytoplankton populations by fitting a time-evolving mixture of
Gaussians model using an expectation-maximization-like algorithm with kernel
smoothing. We use simulated data to demonstrate the validity and robustness of
this approach, and use oceanographic cruise data to highlight the method's
ability to not only replicate but surpass expert manual gating. Finally, we
provide the flowkernel R package, written in literate programming, that
implements the algorithm efficiently.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the computational complexity of property
testing, focusing on the relationship between query and time complexity. While
traditional work in property testing has emphasized query complexity,
relatively little is known about the computational hardness of property
testers. Our goal is to chart the landscape of time-query interplay and develop
tools for proving time complexity lower bounds. Our first contribution is a
pair of time-query hierarchy theorems for property testing. For all suitable
nondecreasing functions $q(n)$ and $t(n)$ with $t(n)\geq q(n)$, we construct
properties with query complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(q(n))$ and time complexity
$\tilde\Omega(t(n))$. Our weak hierarchy holds unconditionally, whereas the
strong version-assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis-provides better
control over the time complexity of the constructed properties.
  We then turn to halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a fundamental class in property
testing and learning theory. We study the problem of approximating the distance
from the input function to the nearest halfspace within additive error
$\epsilon$. For the distribution-free distance approximation problem, known
algorithms achieve query complexity $O(d/\epsilon^2)$, but take time
$\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^d)$. We provide a fine-grained justification for
this gap: assuming the $k$-SUM conjecture, any algorithm must have running time
${\Omega}(1/\epsilon^{d/2})$. This fine-grained lower bound yields a provable
separation between query and time complexity for a natural and well-studied
(tolerant) testing problem. We also prove that any Statistical Query (SQ)
algorithm under the standard Gaussian distribution requires
$(1/\epsilon)^{\Omega(d)}$ queries if the queries are answered with additive
error up to $\epsilon^{\Omega(d)}$, revealing a fundamental barrier even in the
distribution-specific setting.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的RTL代码生成技术存在无法整合新IP、旧模型微调方法竞争力不足、RAG技术有缺陷等问题。

Method: 引入模型无关的RAG框架DeepV，通过大型高质量数据集增强上下文，无需特定RTL训练。

Result: DeepV使OpenAI的GPT - 5在VerilogEval基准测试上性能提升近17%。

Conclusion: DeepV是有效的RTL设计生成框架，已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to be integrated into modern
technology, there has been an increased push towards code generation
applications, which also naturally extends to hardware design automation.
LLM-based solutions for register transfer level (RTL) code generation for
intellectual property (IP) designs have grown, especially with fine-tuned LLMs,
prompt engineering, and agentic approaches becoming popular in literature.
However, a gap has been exposed in these techniques, as they fail to integrate
novel IPs into the model's knowledge base, subsequently resulting in poorly
generated code. Additionally, as general-purpose LLMs continue to improve,
fine-tuned methods on older models will not be able to compete to produce more
accurate and efficient designs. Although some retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) techniques exist to mitigate challenges presented in fine-tuning
approaches, works tend to leverage low-quality codebases, incorporate
computationally expensive fine-tuning in the frameworks, or do not use RAG
directly in the RTL generation step. In this work, we introduce DeepV: a
model-agnostic RAG framework to generate RTL designs by enhancing context
through a large, high-quality dataset without any RTL-specific training. Our
framework benefits the latest commercial LLM, OpenAI's GPT-5, with a near 17%
increase in performance on the VerilogEval benchmark. We host DeepV for use by
the community in a Hugging Face (HF) Space:

Result: Stratum系统在各种基准测试中解码吞吐量提高了8.29倍，能源效率提高了7.66倍。

Conclusion: Stratum系统-硬件协同设计方法有效提升了MoE模型服务的性能和能源效率。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture has emerged as a prevailing design for achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of tasks. MoE models use sparse gating to
activate only a handful of expert sub-networks per input, achieving
billion-parameter capacity with inference costs akin to much smaller models.
However, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the
massive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of
serving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach
that combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D
DRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D
DRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack
and GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher
internal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch
enabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of
higher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency
differences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the
z-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across
layers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage
prediction to boost NMP throughput. The Stratum system achieves up to 8.29x
improvement in decoding throughput and 7.66x better energy efficiency across
various benchmarks compared to GPU baselines.

Conclusion: 为跨各种LLM工作负载的多核NPU设计最优硬件架构和服务策略提供了指导。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for
high-performance LLM inference services continues to grow. To meet this demand,
a growing number of AI accelerators have been proposed, such as Google TPU,
Huawei NPU, Graphcore IPU, and Cerebras WSE, etc. Most of these accelerators
adopt multi-core architectures to achieve enhanced scalability, but lack the
flexibility of SIMT architectures. Therefore, without careful configuration of
the hardware architecture, as well as deliberate design of tensor parallelism
and core placement strategies, computational resources may be underutilized,
resulting in suboptimal inference performance.
  To address these challenges, we first present a multi-level simulation
framework with both transaction-level and performance-model-based simulation
for multi-core NPUs. Using this simulator, we conduct a systematic analysis and
further propose the optimal solutions for tensor parallelism strategies, core
placement policies, memory management methods, as well as the selection between
PD-disaggregation and PD-fusion on multi-core NPUs. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on representative LLMs and various NPU configurations. The
evaluation results demonstrate that, our solution can achieve 1.32x-6.03x
speedup compared to SOTA designs for multi-core NPUs across different hardware
configurations. As for LLM serving, our work offers guidance on designing
optimal hardware architectures and serving strategies for multi-core NPUs
across various LLM workloads.

Result: 在238个挑战性配置上，平均计算时间减少至一半以下。

Conclusion: 改进后的高斯过程方法成为加速鞍点搜索的稳健可扩展算法。

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle
point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of
times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to
be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization
can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also
occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well
enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using
geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using
a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point
sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations
to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made.
Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable
trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the
growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes
prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational
time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published
data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is
established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point
searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires
significant computational effort.

Motivation: 传统优化算法的顺序性限制了可微模型预测控制（MPC）在现代计算硬件上的应用，需解决此瓶颈。

Method: 引入GPU加速的微分优化工具，利用序列二次规划和带三对角预条件的自定义预条件共轭梯度（PCG）例程。

Result: 相比CPU和GPU基线有显著加速，在基准强化学习和模仿学习任务中改善了训练时间。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于处理极限驾驶的强化学习任务，如实现丰田Supra在水坑中的稳健漂移。

Abstract: Differentiable model predictive control (MPC) offers a powerful framework for
combining learning and control. However, its adoption has been limited by the
inherently sequential nature of traditional optimization algorithms, which are
challenging to parallelize on modern computing hardware like GPUs. In this
work, we tackle this bottleneck by introducing a GPU-accelerated differentiable
optimization tool for MPC. This solver leverages sequential quadratic
programming and a custom preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) routine with
tridiagonal preconditioning to exploit the problem's structure and enable
efficient parallelization. We demonstrate substantial speedups over CPU- and
GPU-based baselines, significantly improving upon state-of-the-art training
times on benchmark reinforcement learning and imitation learning tasks.
Finally, we showcase the method on the challenging task of reinforcement
learning for driving at the limits of handling, where it enables robust
drifting of a Toyota Supra through water puddles.

### [320] [Ads that Talk Back: Implications and Perceptions of Injecting Personalized Advertising into LLM Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15436)
*Brian Jay Tang,Kaiwen Sun,Noah T. Curran,Florian Schaub,Kang G. Shin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文通过实验研究大语言模型（LLM）个性化广告的影响，开发含广告的聊天机器人，发现广告注入对LLM性能影响小，参与者难察觉且偏好含隐藏广告的回复，还创建了广告数据集和微调的开源LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模部署LLM计算成本高，公司探索广告收入流，本文研究个性化LLM广告的影响。

Method: 进行有179名参与者的组间实验，开发在LLM回复中嵌入个性化产品广告的聊天机器人。

Result: 广告注入对LLM性能影响小，参与者难察觉广告，偏好含隐藏广告的回复，不点击广告披露而是用自然语言查询改设置。

Conclusion: 创建了广告数据集和微调的开源LLM Phi - 4 - Ads以服务广告并适应用户偏好。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of
highly effective chatbots. However, the compute costs of widely deploying LLMs
have raised questions about profitability. Companies have proposed exploring
ad-based revenue streams for monetizing LLMs, which could serve as the new de
facto platform for advertising. This paper investigates the implications of
personalizing LLM advertisements to individual users via a between-subjects
experiment with 179 participants. We developed a chatbot that embeds
personalized product advertisements within LLM responses, inspired by similar
forays by AI companies. The evaluation of our benchmarks showed that ad
injection only slightly impacted LLM performance, particularly response
desirability. Results revealed that participants struggled to detect ads, and
even preferred LLM responses with hidden advertisements. Rather than clicking
on our advertising disclosure, participants tried changing their advertising
settings using natural language queries. We created an advertising dataset and
an open-source LLM, Phi-4-Ads, fine-tuned to serve ads and flexibly adapt to
user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注文本交互的生成式AI，当前多模态应用发展，需探究编程新手对多模态生成式AI工具的使用情况。

Method: 选择商业多模态生成式AI平台，通过16次有声思维会议，结合参与者观察和半结构化访谈，研究学生在解决编程问题时对工具模态的选择及标准。

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 多模态交流是教育AI的未来，此研究旨在引发对计算机科学教育中，学生与多模态生成式AI交互的持续探索。

Abstract: The broad adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is impacting Computer Science
education, and recent studies found its benefits and potential concerns when
students use it for programming learning. However, most existing explorations
focus on GenAI tools that primarily support text-to-text interaction. With
recent developments, GenAI applications have begun supporting multiple modes of
communication, known as multimodality. In this work, we explored how
undergraduate programming novices choose and work with multimodal GenAI tools,
and their criteria for choices. We selected a commercially available multimodal
GenAI platform for interaction, as it supports multiple input and output
modalities, including text, audio, image upload, and real-time screen-sharing.
Through 16 think-aloud sessions that combined participant observation with
follow-up semi-structured interviews, we investigated student modality choices
for GenAI tools when completing programming problems and the underlying
criteria for modality selections. With multimodal communication emerging as the
future of AI in education, this work aims to spark continued exploration on
understanding student interaction with multimodal GenAI in the context of CS
education.

TL;DR: 提出AgentZero++模型模拟分散集体暴力，有八项行为增强，能展示微观异质性对宏观冲突模式的影响，为分析情感传染和集体行动提供平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟空间分布系统中的分散集体暴力，研究微观认知异质性对宏观冲突模式的影响。

Method: 基于Epstein的Agent_Zero框架，添加八项行为增强，用Python和Mesa ABM框架实现。

Result: 小的记忆、反应性和情感一致性变化可通过反馈循环放大或抑制动荡。

Conclusion: 该模型是分析情感传染和基于心理的集体行动的灵活可扩展平台。

Abstract: We present AgentZero++, an agent-based model that integrates cognitive,
emotional, and social mechanisms to simulate decentralized collective violence
in spatially distributed systems. Building on Epstein's Agent\_Zero framework,
we extend the original model with eight behavioral enhancements: age-based
impulse control; memory-based risk estimation; affect-cognition coupling;
endogenous destructive radius; fight-or-flight dynamics; affective homophily;
retaliatory damage; and multi-agent coordination. These additions allow agents
to adapt based on internal states, previous experiences, and social feedback,
producing emergent dynamics such as protest asymmetries, escalation cycles, and
localized retaliation. Implemented in Python using the Mesa ABM framework,
AgentZero++ enables modular experimentation and visualization of how
micro-level cognitive heterogeneity shapes macro-level conflict patterns. Our
results highlight how small variations in memory, reactivity, and affective
alignment can amplify or dampen unrest through feedback loops. By explicitly
modeling emotional thresholds, identity-driven behavior, and adaptive networks,
this work contributes a flexible and extensible platform for analyzing
affective contagion and psychologically grounded collective action.

Motivation: 探究多智能体LLM系统何时是个体集合，何时是有高阶结构的集成集体。

Method: 引入信息分解框架，实现实用标准和涌现能力标准，以时间延迟互信息的部分信息分解进行操作化，应用于简单猜谜游戏实验并进行随机干预。

Result: 控制组有强时间协同但跨智能体协调对齐少；为智能体分配角色引入稳定身份关联差异；结合角色与思考其他智能体行为的指令，展现身份关联差异和目标导向互补性。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统可通过提示设计从单纯聚合体转变为高阶集体，结果稳健，交互模式符合人类集体智能原则。

Abstract: When are multi-agent LLM systems merely a collection of individual agents
versus an integrated collective with higher-order structure? We introduce an
information-theoretic framework to test -- in a purely data-driven way --
whether multi-agent systems show signs of higher-order structure. This
information decomposition lets us measure whether dynamical emergence is
present in multi-agent LLM systems, localize it, and distinguish spurious
temporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy. We implement
both a practical criterion and an emergence capacity criterion operationalized
as partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information (TDMI).
We apply our framework to experiments using a simple guessing game without
direct agent communication and only minimal group-level feedback with three
randomized interventions. Groups in the control condition exhibit strong
temporal synergy but only little coordinated alignment across agents. Assigning
a persona to each agent introduces stable identity-linked differentiation.
Combining personas with an instruction to ``think about what other agents might
do'' shows identity-linked differentiation and goal-directed complementarity
across agents. Taken together, our framework establishes that multi-agent LLM
systems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order
collectives. Our results are robust across emergence measures and entropy
estimators, and not explained by coordination-free baselines or temporal
dynamics alone. Without attributing human-like cognition to the agents, the
patterns of interaction we observe mirror well-established principles of
collective intelligence in human groups: effective performance requires both
alignment on shared objectives and complementary contributions across members.

Motivation: 集体行为依赖规模但又对个体损失有鲁棒性，需系统研究数量对集体行为的影响。

Method: 对标准分叉分析进行细微修改以识别临界数量。

Result: 发现不同物理尺度和科学领域的临界数量通常源于不同缩放的竞争反馈，找到过去研究中被忽视的临界数量，指出随机模型的确定性近似在临界数量附近可能失效。

Conclusion: 区分了这些定性变化与密度依赖的相变，讨论了方法推广到更广泛集体行为类别的可能性。

Abstract: From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass
raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends
critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such
behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the
need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior.
We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly
at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification
of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including
those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating
them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across
physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks
that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked
critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the
implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how
deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical
numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from
density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could
generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.

Motivation: 研究信道模拟和分布式匹配这两个在机器学习中有多种应用的基本问题。

Method: 使用集成拒绝采样（ERS），提出基于ERS的新编码方案，给出ERS的分布式匹配引理。

Result: 新编码方案实现接近最优的编码率，分布式匹配引理推广了相关工作，实验验证了方案在分布式压缩中的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提方法在信道模拟和分布式匹配问题上有效，在分布式压缩中比先前工作更具实际意义。

Abstract: We study channel simulation and distributed matching, two fundamental
problems with several applications to machine learning, using a recently
introduced generalization of the standard rejection sampling (RS) algorithm
known as Ensemble Rejection Sampling (ERS). For channel simulation, we propose
a new coding scheme based on ERS that achieves a near-optimal coding rate. In
this process, we demonstrate that standard RS can also achieve a near-optimal
coding rate and generalize the result of Braverman and Garg (2014) to the
continuous alphabet setting. Next, as our main contribution, we present a
distributed matching lemma for ERS, which serves as the rejection sampling
counterpart to the Poisson Matching Lemma (PML) introduced by Li and Anantharam
(2021). Our result also generalizes a recent work on importance matching lemma
(Phan et al, 2024) and, to our knowledge, is the first result on distributed
matching in the family of rejection sampling schemes where the matching
probability is close to PML. We demonstrate the practical significance of our
approach over prior works by applying it to distributed compression. The
effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated through experiments involving
synthetic Gaussian sources and distributed image compression using the MNIST
dataset.

Conclusion: 所开发的工具和推导的界有效，能解决现有研究的不足。

Abstract: Minimax risk and regret focus on expectation, missing rare failures critical
in safety-critical bandits and reinforcement learning. Minimax quantiles
capture these tails. Three strands of prior work motivate this study:
minimax-quantile bounds restricted to non-interactive estimation; unified
interactive analyses that focus on expected risk rather than risk level
specific quantile bounds; and high-probability bandit bounds that still lack a
quantile-specific toolkit for general interactive protocols. To close this gap,
within the interactive statistical decision making framework, we develop
high-probability Fano and Le Cam tools and derive risk level explicit
minimax-quantile bounds, including a quantile-to-expectation conversion and a
tight link between strict and lower minimax quantiles. Instantiating these
results for the two-armed Gaussian bandit immediately recovers optimal-rate
bounds.

Method: 分析HCP的fMRI数据，使用基本线性机器学习模型分类脑状态，进行特征重要性排名，研究脑区时间动态。

Result: 线性模型能有效分类脑状态并达先进水平，尤其是运动和语言任务；可识别与特定认知功能相关脑区；fMRI信号时间结构对脑区间功能连接很重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持大脑皮质和皮质下区域功能特化假设，从时间角度为认知处理中大脑神经网络形成和调节提供更深入见解。

Abstract: We analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) to match brain activities during a range of cognitive
tasks. Our findings demonstrate that even basic linear machine learning models
can effectively classify brain states and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy,
particularly for tasks related to motor functions and language processing.
Feature importance ranking allows to identify distinct sets of brain regions
whose activation patterns are uniquely associated with specific cognitive
functions. These discriminative features provide strong support for the
hypothesis of functional specialization across cortical and subcortical areas
of the human brain.
  Additionally, we investigate the temporal dynamics of the identified brain
regions, demonstrating that the time-dependent structure of fMRI signals are
essential for shaping functional connectivity between regions: uncorrelated
areas are least important for classification. This temporal perspective
provides deeper insights into the formation and modulation of brain neural
networks involved in cognitive processing.

Motivation: 现有TSFMs训练语料不包含天文时间序列数据，而天文时间序列有独特挑战，需对TSFMs进行评估。

Method: 引入StarEmbed基准，在三个下游任务上评估三种TSFMs和一个特定领域变压器，与手工特征提取对比。

Result: TSFMs（尤其是Chronos模型）在一些任务中可超越既定特定基线，在分布外源检测基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: 测试了TSFMs泛化能力，推动时域天文学从特定任务全监督管道向采用通用基础模型表示分析大规模数据集转变。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as
highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although
their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data.
Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges
including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed,
the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of
state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves'').
We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised
clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source
detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with
multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k
hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We
evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI,
Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against
handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics
literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos
models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical
observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in
some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular,
TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source
detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time
series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm
shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised
pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the
analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.

Result: 灵活工作安排最能提升WLB和员工积极性，WLB与动机呈显著正相关，不同人群对WLB感知有差异。

Conclusion: 组织支持WLB能提高员工忠诚度、生产力和雇主品牌形象，整合WLB举措可改善组织绩效和社会福祉，建议未来研究文化、职业和远程工作背景下的WLB策略。

Abstract: This study examines the role of work-life balance (WLB) as a strategic
component of effective business management and its influence on employee
motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational performance. Drawing on a
quantitative survey of 102 economically active individuals, the research
investigates the effectiveness of various WLB initiatives, including flexible
working hours, private medical care, and additional employee benefits. The
results reveal that flexible working arrangements are the most impactful tool
for enhancing work-life balance and significantly contribute to higher levels
of employee motivation. A statistically significant positive correlation was
observed between perceived work-life balance and motivation, indicating that
improving WLB directly strengthens commitment, reduces burnout, and increases
job satisfaction. Moreover, the findings highlight differences in WLB
perceptions across demographic groups, suggesting the need for tailored
policies. The study emphasizes that organizations actively supporting WLB
achieve greater employee loyalty, improved productivity, and enhanced employer
branding. These results have practical implications for human resource
strategies, showing that integrating WLB initiatives can improve overall
organizational performance and societal well-being. The paper also identifies
research gaps and recommends exploring cultural, occupational, and remote work
contexts in future studies to better understand how WLB strategies shape
workforce engagement in dynamic labor markets.

motivators shape engagement and performance. Based on a quantitative survey of
102 employees, the research analyzes differences in motivation levels across
gender, age, and work experience, as well as the perceived effectiveness of
various motivational tools. The findings indicate that financial incentives,
particularly bonuses for achieving targets, are the most influential
motivators, while non-financial factors such as flexible work schedules,
additional leave, career development opportunities, and workplace atmosphere
also play a crucial role in enhancing motivation. Significant variations in
motivation were observed, with men, older employees, and those with longer
tenure reporting higher levels. The study also reveals that work-life balance
initiatives substantially increase motivation, highlighting the importance of
combining financial and non-financial strategies to achieve optimal results.
The results provide actionable insights for managers seeking to design

Abstract: This study examines the influence of various leadership styles on project
efficiency across diverse organizational contexts. Using a quantitative
research design, data were collected through a survey of 100 project
professionals representing multiple industries, and analyzed with statistical
techniques, including Spearman correlation, to explore the relationship between
leadership behaviors and project performance. The results show that leadership
style significantly affects project outcomes, with constructive feedback, clear
communication of goals, role clarity, and encouragement of team initiative
emerging as the most impactful behaviors. These factors strongly correlate with
project success indicators such as goal achievement, budget adherence, and
stakeholder satisfaction. The findings also highlight areas needing
improvement, including time management, conflict resolution, and involving team
members in decision-making. Moreover, the study provides empirical evidence
that leadership styles directly shape team dynamics, motivation, and
collaboration, which in turn influence overall efficiency. While democratic and
participative approaches enhance engagement, they do not always translate
directly into measurable project results in the short term. The study
contributes to the literature by bridging the gap between leadership theory and
project management practice, offering actionable insights for managers seeking
to optimize team performance. Future research should consider larger, more

Motivation: 现有语音风格转换方法多为经验性，缺乏可靠的理论基础来保证可靠且可解释的控制。

Method: 构建基于非概率自动编码器架构的框架，在预测潜在变量和目标可控变量间设置独立约束。

Result: 通过对语音风格（如说话人身份和情感）评估，证实方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能实现一致的信号转换，保留原始内容并修改所需属性，具备有效性和通用性。

Abstract: While signal conversion and disentangled representation learning have shown
promise for manipulating data attributes across domains such as audio, image,
and multimodal generation, existing approaches, especially for speech style
conversion, are largely empirical and lack rigorous theoretical foundations to
guarantee reliable and interpretable control. In this work, we propose a
general framework for speech attribute conversion, accompanied by theoretical
analysis and guarantees under reasonable assumptions. Our framework builds on a
non-probabilistic autoencoder architecture with an independence constraint
between the predicted latent variable and the target controllable variable.
This design ensures a consistent signal transformation, conditioned on an
observed style variable, while preserving the original content and modifying
the desired attribute. We further demonstrate the versatility of our method by
evaluating it on speech styles, including speaker identity and emotion.
Quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach.

Transformer V2 for efficient and expressive visual feature extraction. Central
to the architecture is a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism, which
facilitates deep contextual fusion between modalities, enabling rich and
complementary representation learning. To capture temporal dependencies within
the fused embeddings, a stack of lightweight Squeezeformer blocks combining
convolutional and attention modules is introduced. The enhanced embeddings are
then decoded via a U-Net-style decoder for direct waveform reconstruction,
ensuring perceptually consistent and intelligible speech output. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AUREXA-SE, achieving significant
performance improvements over noisy baselines, with STOI of 0.516, PESQ of
1.323, and SI-SDR of -4.322 dB. The source code of AUREXA-SE is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音合成发展使深度伪造检测受关注，系统需高效、鲁棒且有可解释性，聚焦潜在表示解释。

Method: 聚焦AASIST最后一层嵌入，用受SAEs启发的TopK激活获取稀疏表示用于决策。

Result: 在ASVSpoof5测试集上EER为23.36%（稀疏度95%），表示解耦性更好，部分攻击直接编码在潜在空间。

Conclusion: 稀疏深度伪造检测可提升检测性能，潜在表示有更好解耦性。

Abstract: Due to the rapid progress of speech synthesis, deepfake detection has become
a major concern in the speech processing community. Because it is a critical
task, systems must not only be efficient and robust, but also provide
interpretable explanations. Among the different approaches for explainability,
we focus on the interpretation of latent representations. In such paper, we
focus on the last layer of embeddings of AASIST, a deepfake detection
architecture. We use a TopK activation inspired by SAEs on this layer to obtain
sparse representations which are used in the decision process. We demonstrate
that sparse deepfake detection can improve detection performance, with an EER
of 23.36% on ASVSpoof5 test set, with 95% of sparsity. We then show that these
representations provide better disentanglement, using completeness and
modularity metrics based on mutual information. Notably, some attacks are
directly encoded in the latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去几十年和弦转录受关注多，而歌曲节奏模式转录和编码研究少，且难定义唯一正确节奏模式，需创建有明确标签的数据集。

Method: 请专家转录410首流行歌曲节奏模式并录制翻唱，提出三步框架：先近似音轨分离提取吉他部分，再用预训练模型检测单个扫弦，最后进行模式解码。

Result: 能以较高准确性转录复音音乐中吉他音轨的节奏模式，生成可读表示并包含自动检测的小节线和节拍标记。

Conclusion: 提出评估指标对预测的节奏模式序列准确性和可读性进行评估。

Abstract: Whereas chord transcription has received considerable attention during the
past couple of decades, far less work has been devoted to transcribing and
encoding the rhythmic patterns that occur in a song. The topic is especially
relevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played
by strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many
cases one cannot objectively define a single "right" rhythmic pattern for a
given song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels,
we asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular
songs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those
transcriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic
patterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate
stem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture.
Secondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using
a pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a
pattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is
represented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that
it is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in
polyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is
human-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature
markers. We perform ablation studies and error analysis and propose a set of
evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and readability of the predicted
rhythmic pattern sequence.

developed. By factorizing a song into segments and generating each one through
selective attention to related segments, the model achieves higher quality and
efficiency compared to prior work. To demonstrate its suitability for human-AI
interaction, we further wrap SFS into a web application that enables users to
iteratively co-create music on a piano roll with customizable structures and

Motivation: 解决视频对齐音频生成研究较少的问题，现有方法主要关注时间同步，缺乏空间感知。

Method: 引入StereoSync模型，利用预训练基础模型，从深度图和边界框提取空间线索，在基于扩散的音频生成模型中作为交叉注意力条件。

Result: 在Walking The Maps数据集上实验，StereoSync能实现时间和空间对齐，提升视频到音频生成水平。

Conclusion: StereoSync模型在视频对齐音频生成上有显著进步，带来更沉浸和真实的音频体验。

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years,
video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier.
To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model
designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a
reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover,
StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models,
reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality
synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal
synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by
incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed,
given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and
bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based
audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple
synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial
structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The
Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature
animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial
alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and
resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

Conclusion: FoleyGRAM推进了视频到音频合成的技术水平。

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio
generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned
multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio
generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure
(GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling
precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of
FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on
GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness
and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate
FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio
models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型语音合成推理效率低，蒸馏成一致性模型有额外训练成本且依赖预训练教师模型。

Method: 将Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) 策略引入语音合成，逐步收紧一致性约束；设计多尺度门模块 (MSGate) 增强去噪器融合特征能力。

Result: 在LJSpeech数据集上，单步采样下ECTSpeech音频质量与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: ECTSpeech能实现高质量一步语音合成，显著降低训练复杂度和成本。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech
synthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low
inference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion
models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation.
However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily
on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose
ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for
the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into
speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a
pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step
generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we
design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to
fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset
demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to
state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially
reducing the model's training cost and complexity.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is pivotal for enhancing human-machine
interactions. This paper introduces "EmoHRNet", a novel adaptation of
High-Resolution Networks (HRNet) tailored for SER. The HRNet structure is
designed to maintain high-resolution representations from the initial to the
final layers. By transforming audio samples into spectrograms, EmoHRNet
leverages the HRNet architecture to extract high-level features. EmoHRNet's
unique architecture maintains high-resolution representations throughout,
capturing both granular and overarching emotional cues from speech signals. The
model outperforms leading models, achieving accuracies of 92.45% on RAVDESS,
80.06% on IEMOCAP, and 92.77% on EMOVO. Thus, we show that EmoHRNet sets a new

Conclusion: 该方法能有效发现声音中的调制，代码、音频样本和训练好的DDSP合成器以VST插件形式公开。

Abstract: Modulations are a critical part of sound design and music production,
enabling the creation of complex and evolving audio. Modern synthesizers
provide envelopes, low frequency oscillators (LFOs), and more parameter
automation tools that allow users to modulate the output with ease. However,
determining the modulation signals used to create a sound is difficult, and
existing sound-matching / parameter estimation systems are often
uninterpretable black boxes or predict high-dimensional framewise parameter
values without considering the shape, structure, and routing of the underlying
modulation curves. We propose a neural sound-matching approach that leverages
modulation extraction, constrained control signal parameterizations, and
differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) to discover the modulations
present in a sound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on highly
modulated synthetic and real audio samples, its applicability to different DDSP
synth architectures, and investigate the trade-off it incurs between
interpretability and sound-matching accuracy. We make our code and audio
samples available and provide the trained DDSP synths in a VST plugin.

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in

Result: CogRE解决了单样本关系抽取的常见失败模式，在One - shot NYT29上表现超越先前设计，强化学习优化进一步提升性能，人类评估显示生成关键词与金标准标签契合，解释质量评分提升54%。

Conclusion: CogRE框架有效提升了关系抽取的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

Method: 提出分布语义追踪（DST）统一框架，结合可解释性技术；找出模型中幻觉不可避免的承诺层；从双过程理论视角分析计算路径冲突。

Result: 发现模型内部表征与事实不可逆偏离的承诺层；观察到联想路径和上下文路径冲突导致推理捷径劫持等失败模式；框架量化的上下文路径连贯性与幻觉率强负相关（ρ = -0.863）。

Conclusion: 给出了Transformer架构中幻觉发生的机制性解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习可作为传统低秩方法的有力替代，用于高效大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

Result: CARE显著提高了回复的逻辑性和支持性。

Conclusion: CARE推动了富有同理心、认知能力强且类人的情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

Motivation: 解决行业中缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低等关键挑战。

Method: 提出MADS框架，使用用户智能体、对话智能体和优化智能体，通过自博弈生成对话，用用户CoA建模和大语言模型评估验证。

Result: 应用于营销场景使小语言模型说服能力显著提升，有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%。

Conclusion: MADS框架有效，能低成本生成无人工标注的训练数据，有明确商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

TL;DR: 研究通过监督微调提升大语言模型不确定性交流能力，发现微调能提升校准和区分能力，改进是任务特定的，多任务微调效果更好。


<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在决策场景使用时，未明确低置信度信号会让用户误判，且其明确表达的置信度通常校准不佳。研究旨在探究监督微调能否提升模型交流不确定性的能力以及这种改进能否跨任务和领域泛化。

Method: 在涵盖常识、数学和开放式问答的数据集上对两种大语言模型进行微调，评估单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较两个元认知任务，评估对未见领域的泛化能力。

Result: 微调提升了模型在校准和区分能力，且不改变准确率，但改进是任务特定的，多任务微调在跨领域评估中能带来更广泛的提升。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的不确定性交流能力可训练且能泛化，但不同元认知技能需通过多任务训练共同发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

Motivation: 解决新员工或轮岗员工在GoEngage平台主页定位任务模块的困难，如专业术语、系统命名及词汇搜索局限。

Method: 提出结合轻量级容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似度和受限大语言模型重排序的混合语义搜索系统，利用现有基础设施，采用智能缓存等机制。

Result: 提供包含所需资源、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议和在线测量方法的综合框架。

Conclusion: 该混合语义搜索系统及其框架可解决GoEngage平台任务定位难题，具有低误报率、可进化和经济高效等优势。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通过并行测试时计算提升性能，需生成多样且准确推理路径，但常见鼓励多样性策略存在多样性与准确性的权衡问题。

Method: 将并行推理视为下一个标记预测集问题，使用全局分叉标记和独特推理轨迹间的自监督二分匹配，将基于集合的全局损失纳入监督微调（SFT），提出SSFT方法。

Result: 实验表明在多个推理基准测试中，SSFT在Pass@1和Cons@k指标上始终优于SFT。

Conclusion: SSFT方法能解决并行推理中多样性和准确性权衡问题，表现优于传统SFT方法。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

Result: 使用XLM - R等编码器的基准实验因平衡标签和精细标注，比WMT21有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: SynCED - EnDe可作为社区资源，推动机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手等新兴场景的安全部署。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

Result: 通过不同设置下的大量实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: dLLMs解码机制可作为模型归因的有力工具，提出的DDM和GTA方法能有效解决模型归因问题。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

Method: 提出Chronological Thinking机制，具有严格因果性且无额外延迟，推理在聆听窗口内完成。

Result: 通过客观指标和人工评估证明该机制能提升响应质量，能稳健处理对话动态，在全双工交互指标上表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: Chronological Thinking机制能有效提升全双工口语对话语言模型的响应质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Method: 在多个领先模型家族（Llama、Qwen、Gemma）上测试不同分隔符对MMLU性能的影响，探测注意力头分数，探索提升鲁棒性的方法。

Result: 分隔符选择可显著改变模型响应质量，性能差异可达±23%，还可操纵模型排名；好的分隔符能引导注意力到输入关键令牌；在提示中指定分隔符可提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对分隔符选择很脆弱，在提示中指定分隔符可提升鲁棒性，并给出了表现最佳的分隔符选择建议。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

Conclusion: 简单分类算法能可靠区分单一大语言模型中的幻觉与准确响应，提供轻量级有效框架提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保其系统安全成为紧迫问题，而外部基于LLM的护栏模型易受数据分布变化影响，需研究其对上下文中额外信息的鲁棒性。

Method: 以RAG为例，对3个Llama Guards和2个GPT - oss模型进行系统评估，分别分析增强上下文中各组件的影响，并测试两种缓解方法。

Result: 在约11%和8%的情况下，插入良性文档会改变输入和输出护栏的判断，使其不可靠，两种缓解方法仅带来微小改进。

Conclusion: 当前护栏存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害大语言模型性能，与检索质量和干扰无关；提出的缓解策略有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

Conclusion: IDIOMoE能有效结合协同过滤和大语言模型优势，可用于推荐系统。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

Motivation: 准确对齐题目与内容标准对大规模评估分数解释很关键，需评估自动对齐范式。

Method: 提取嵌入特征训练经典监督机器学习模型并研究降维影响；微调8个BERT及其变体模型；探索集成学习。

Result: DeBERTa - v3 - base在领域对齐中F1最高为0.950，RoBERTa - large在技能对齐中F1最高为0.869，集成模型未超最佳语言模型，降维提升嵌入线性分类器但不如语言模型。

Conclusion: 展示了自动题目与内容标准对齐的不同方法。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating

We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Motivation: 大语言模型理解长文档时信息过载，缺乏系统设计的记忆模块，需提升为自主阅读代理。

Method: 受建构主义理论启发，开发CAM，采用增量重叠聚类算法进行结构化记忆开发，推理时自适应探索记忆结构。

Result: 在多种长文本阅读理解任务中，与现有方法相比，CAM在性能和效率上有双重优势。

Conclusion: 提出的基于建构主义理论的代理记忆设计为大语言模型阅读理解提供了更强大高效的记忆系统。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

Method: 提出EAD策略，生成时将采样温度从高到低退火，实现“开始探索、结尾利用”。

Result: EAD是轻量级即插即用方法，显著提高样本效率，在多种RLVR算法和模型大小上优于固定温度采样。

Conclusion: 使探索与序列生成自然动态一致，为改善大语言模型推理提供可靠途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

Conclusion: DPO可使轻量级临床语言模型符合专家标准，支持电子健康记录系统中AI辅助文档，减轻管理负担并提高患者安全。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型依赖英语作为潜在表征，存在翻译障碍，现有跨语言上下文学习方法效果不佳，限制了基于大语言模型应用的包容性。

Method: 引入代码切换上下文学习（CSICL）策略，在示例和指令中从目标语言逐步过渡到英语，以促进潜在的英语推理。

Result: CSICL始终优于X - ICL基线，在目标语言和未见语言中分别提高3.1%和1.9%，在低资源环境下提升更明显。

Conclusion: 代码切换是克服推理过程中翻译障碍的有效方法，有助于大语言模型实现更公平有效的多语言系统。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Result: TensorBLEU在消费级和数据中心级硬件上比NLTK分别快超13倍和40倍。

Conclusion: TensorBLEU将训练中的显著瓶颈变为可忽略部分，开源为相关研究提供有力工具。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型自回归解码的长上下文推理是内存受限问题，现有方法不能完全解决，如未压缩某组件或丢弃上下文信息。

Method: 引入Hybrid One - Bit KV Cache (H1B - KV)，用1位二进制草图表示键向量，用4位量化压缩值向量。

Result: 70亿参数的大语言模型用不到60MB缓存内存处理8k标记上下文，轻微调后在基准测试和下游任务上性能与全精度相当，在每字节质量上显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: H1B - KV是在内存受限环境中部署大语言模型的可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

Result: 将PGSVD应用于大语言模型和视觉 - 语言模型，在相同压缩级别下有更好准确性和推理加速。

Conclusion: 所提出的低秩压缩框架和PGSVD方法能有效解决模型部署的内存和计算挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

Result: TKTO使日语TTS准确率提高39%，降低CER 54%，自动为目标标记分配强12.8倍的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO是一种更高效的数据训练范式，能有效提升TTS模型性能。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Motivation: 长上下文模型易受上下文噪声影响，误导模型注意力，需要解决该问题。

Method: 进行上下文噪声细粒度分析，提出IG分数检测量化噪声，提出CDT训练策略。

Result: 简单缓解检测到的上下文噪声可提升模型对关键令牌的注意力，四个任务实验显示CDT有优越性，开源8B模型用CDT训练后性能接近GPT - 4o。

Conclusion: CDT是一种简单有效的训练策略，能提升模型对关键令牌的注意力及预测效果。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

<details>

Motivation: 评估大语言模型的道德对齐情况，发现潜在问题，推动文化感知AI发展。

Method: 使用两种评分方法和模型作为评判的同行评审，在两项调查上评估模型。框架包含评分、思维链协议和同行评审。

Result: 顶级模型与调查响应紧密对齐，存在明显地区差异，同行评审与调查对齐相关。

Conclusion: 在文化感知AI方面取得进展，但跨地区使用仍有挑战。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

Conclusion: 值得对受强化学习启发的无参数优化方法进行未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型多在无约束规划领域测试，为应用于需遵守约束的现实场景，需评估其在受限规划任务上的表现。

Method: 引入LexiCon基准，对现有规划环境施加时间约束，将问题转化为自然语言让大语言模型解决，且该基准具有可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明包括GPT - 5等在内的先进大语言模型，其性能随规划任务受限程度增加而变差。

Conclusion: LexiCon可用于评估大语言模型在受限规划任务上的规划能力，模型在受限任务上的表现有待提高。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

Conclusion: 提出的基准可解决中文大语言模型评估问题，提供开源代码支持可复现研究并给出未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语是低资源语言且方言多样，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准孟加拉语，需开发新系统。

Method: 采用客户端 - 服务器架构和RTP协议确保低延迟通信，微调IndicWav2Vec模型开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型性能高12.41 - 33.98%，BanglaTalk可在24 kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟4.9秒。

Conclusion: BanglaTalk成本低、交互性好，能为孟加拉语使用者提供普惠的语音技术。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

Motivation: 解决语言模型后训练在多答案任务中常被忽视的代价问题，提升模型条件分布建模特性。

Method: 定义三个条件分布建模的理想特性，引入Spectrum Suite评估，提出Spectrum Tuning方法。

Result: 当前后训练技术虽能引出模型潜在能力和知识，但损害了模型上下文灵活引导能力；Spectrum Tuning在多个方面优于预训练和指令调优模型。

Conclusion: Spectrum Tuning能提升模型上下文引导能力、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Conclusion: LST能使预训练语音 - 文本模型更具数据效率，促进了语音 - 文本模型的发展，将发布模型、代码和评估数据以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型因初始置信度低重复掩码标记，导致冗余迭代，限制加速效果，需利用历史信息避免冗余步骤。

Method: 引入Trace Credit概念量化标记收敛潜力，提出无训练的并行解码算法CreditDecoding，融合当前对数似然和Trace Credit加速置信度收敛。

Result: 在八个基准测试上，CreditDecoding较LLaDA - 8B - Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48的性能提升，较LLaDA - MoE - Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15的性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效减少冗余迭代，增强解码鲁棒性，可有效处理长序列，且与主流推理优化正交，是易集成且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing
adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

Conclusion: 校准置信和保守路由能让 AI 可靠处理部分常规评分，复杂情况保留专家判断。

Abstract: We investigate whether contemporary multimodal LLMs can assist with grading
open-ended calculus at scale without eroding validity. In a large first-year
exam, students' handwritten work was graded by GPT-5 against the same rubric
used by teaching assistants (TAs), with fractional credit permitted; TA rubric
decisions served as ground truth. We calibrated a human-in-the-loop filter that
combines a partial-credit threshold with an Item Response Theory (2PL) risk
measure based on the deviation between the AI score and the model-expected
score for each student-item. Unfiltered AI-TA agreement was moderate, adequate
for low-stakes feedback but not for high-stakes use. Confidence filtering made
the workload-quality trade-off explicit: under stricter settings, AI delivered
human-level accuracy, but also left roughly 70% of the items to be graded by
humans. Psychometric patterns were constrained by low stakes on the open-ended
portion, a small set of rubric checkpoints, and occasional misalignment between
designated answer regions and where work appeared. Practical adjustments such
as slightly higher weight and protected time, a few rubric-visible substeps,
stronger spatial anchoring should raise ceiling performance. Overall,
calibrated confidence and conservative routing enable AI to reliably handle a
sizable subset of routine cases while reserving expert judgment for ambiguous
or pedagogically rich responses.
