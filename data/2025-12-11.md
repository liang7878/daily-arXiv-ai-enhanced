### [1] [Calibrated Trust in Dealing with LLM Hallucinations: A Qualitative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09088)
*Adrian Ryser,Florian Allwein,Tim Schlippe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型幻觉对用户信任和交互的影响，发现会导致情境敏感的信任校准，确认了一些信任因素并提出实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型幻觉如何影响用户对模型的信任和交互。

Method: 通过对192名参与者进行定性研究。

Result: 幻觉导致情境敏感的信任校准，确认了一些用户相关信任因素，发现直觉可用于幻觉检测，信任还受情境因素影响。

Conclusion: 验证并扩展递归信任校准过程，提出负责任和反思性使用大语言模型的实用建议。

Abstract: Hallucinations are outputs by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are factually incorrect yet appear plausible [1]. This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Blöbaum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.

### [2] [AI TIPS 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Operationalizing AI Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09114)
*Pamela Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统部署面临治理挑战，现有框架无法解决，提出AI TIPS框架应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统部署时现有治理框架无法应对的风险评估不足、缺乏可操作控制、难以规模化运营等问题。

Method: 提出AI TIPS（Artificial Intelligence Trust - Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0）框架。

Result: 文中未提及框架应用后的具体结果。

Conclusion: AI TIPS框架可直接应对当前AI系统部署的治理挑战。

Abstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.

Abstract: We present SDialog, an MIT-licensed open-source Python toolkit that unifies dialog generation, evaluation and mechanistic interpretability into a single end-to-end framework for building and analyzing LLM-based conversational agents. Built around a standardized \texttt{Dialog} representation, SDialog provides: (1) persona-driven multi-agent simulation with composable orchestration for controlled, synthetic dialog generation, (2) comprehensive evaluation combining linguistic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge and functional correctness validators, (3) mechanistic interpretability tools for activation inspection and steering via feature ablation and induction, and (4) audio generation with full acoustic simulation including 3D room modeling and microphone effects. The toolkit integrates with all major LLM backends, enabling mixed-backend experiments under a unified API. By coupling generation, evaluation, and interpretability in a dialog-centric architecture, SDialog enables researchers to build, benchmark and understand conversational systems more systematically.

Conclusion: 研究推动未来将结构化符号推理与连接主义表征统一的神经符号架构发展，使AI兼具高性能、可解释性和认知基础。

Abstract: Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.

### [6] [Architectures for Building Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09458)
*Sławomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为代理和生成式AI的可靠性主要是架构属性，定义代理系统，分析可靠性来源，提出实用分类法并给出设计指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨代理和生成式AI可靠性的本质及提升方法。

Method: 定义代理系统，分析架构组件、接口和控制循环，提出分类法并分析不同模式。

Result: 明确可靠性来源，给出实用分类法及不同模式对可靠性的影响。

Conclusion: 总结出关于类型化模式、幂等性等方面的设计指导。

Abstract: This chapter argues that the reliability of agentic and generative AI is chiefly an architectural property. We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes. We distil design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance and hygiene, runtime governance (budgets, termination conditions), and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.

Motivation: 传统药物发现方法成功率低、可扩展性有限，现有生成模型存在泛化不足、可解释性差等问题，限制其转化应用。

Method: 提出Trio分子生成框架，集成基于片段的分子语言建模、强化学习和蒙特卡罗树搜索。

Result: Trio能生成化学有效且药理增强的配体，在结合亲和力、类药性和合成可及性上优于现有方法，分子多样性扩展超四倍。

Conclusion: Trio框架在药物设计中有效且可解释，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, with traditional high-throughput and docking-based virtual screening hampered by low success rates and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.

*Emanuele La Malfa,Ping Zhu,Samuele Marro,Sara Bernardini,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个由验证器支持的端到端规划框架，用大语言模型驱动，可将自然语言规范转换为计划并再转成自然语言，在多领域任务中展示了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现端到端的规划，解决人类规范中的歧义、矛盾等问题，减少人工干预。

Method: 编排器将自然语言规范转换为PDDL模型，子模块迭代优化，用外部规划引擎生成计划，最后将计划转成自然语言，全程由大语言模型驱动。

Result: 框架在多个领域和任务中展示了灵活性和有效性，能与多种PDDL规划引擎和验证器集成。

Conclusion: 该框架是迈向大语言模型辅助端到端规划的重要一步。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for planning supported by verifiers. An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在连续动作空间环境中，根并行蒙特卡罗树搜索不同线程统计信息的最佳聚合方法尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用高斯过程回归来获取未在环境中试验的有前景动作的值估计。

Result: 在6个不同领域的系统评估中，该方法优于现有聚合策略，推理时间仅有适度增加。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在连续动作空间环境中是有效的，能在有限的额外推理时间成本下提升性能。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a cornerstone algorithm for online planning, and its root-parallel variant is widely used when wall clock time is limited but best performance is desired. In environments with continuous action spaces, how to best aggregate statistics from different threads is an important yet underexplored question. In this work, we introduce a method that uses Gaussian Process Regression to obtain value estimates for promising actions that were not trialed in the environment. We perform a systematic evaluation across 6 different domains, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing aggregation strategies while requiring a modest increase in inference time.

Result: 通过研究了解设计选择在现实场景中对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 指出开放挑战和研究方向，引导社区实现实际应用部署。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms are increasingly deployed in industrial warehouses and automated manufacturing facilities, where robots must operate reliably under real-world physical constraints. However, existing MAPF evaluation frameworks typically rely on simplified robot models, leaving a substantial gap between algorithmic benchmarks and practical performance. Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios. We highlight open challenges and research directions to steer the community toward practical, real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出RIFT框架用于高效设计时故障评估，在LLM工作负载上评估显示有速度、测试向量和覆盖度优势，还能提供硬件保护策略并生成可集成验证工件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI加速器规模大，传统故障评估方法计算成本高、关键故障模式覆盖差。

Method: 将最坏情况故障搜索转化为顺序决策问题，结合混合灵敏度分析进行搜索空间剪枝，用强化学习生成最小高影响测试套件。

Result: 在LLM工作负载上，相比进化方法实现2.2倍故障评估加速，相比随机故障注入减少超99%测试向量，有更好故障覆盖度；RIFT引导的选择性纠错码成本效益提升12.8倍。

Conclusion: RIFT框架能高效进行故障评估，提供硬件保护策略，生成的验证工件可集成到商业RTL验证工作流。

Abstract: The massive scale of modern AI accelerators presents critical challenges to traditional fault assessment methodologies, which face prohibitive computational costs and provide poor coverage of critical failure modes. This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \textbf{2.2$\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \textbf{99\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \textbf{12.8$\times$} improvement in \textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection. RIFT automatically generates UVM-compliant verification artifacts, ensuring its findings are directly actionable and integrable into commercial RTL verification workflows.

### [12] [Interpretation as Linear Transformation: A Cognitive-Geometric Model of Belief and Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09831)
*Chainarong Amornbunchornvej*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出认知异质主体信念、动机和影响建模的几何框架，解释信念动态，统一多领域见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为认知异质主体的信念、动机和影响建模，统一概念空间、社会认识论和AI价值对齐的见解。

Method: 构建几何框架，用个性化价值空间表示主体，将信念形式化为结构化向量，通过线性解释映射传递。

Result: 得出“无零空间领导条件”，解释抽象事物在不同认知几何中的传播、变异和消失。

Conclusion: 认知几何视角能阐明人类和人工系统中影响的认知边界，为分析异质主体的信念动态提供基础。

Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for modeling belief, motivation, and influence across cognitively heterogeneous agents. Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.
  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.
  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.

TL;DR: 首次在真实企业环境评估AI代理与人类网络安全专家，新代理框架ARTEMIS表现出色，AI代理有优有劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实企业环境中对AI代理和人类网络安全专家进行全面评估。

Method: 在包含约8000个主机、12个子网的大学网络中，对10名网络安全专家、6个现有AI代理和新代理框架ARTEMIS进行评估。

Result: ARTEMIS总体排名第二，发现9个有效漏洞，有效提交率82%，优于9名人类参与者；现有框架表现不佳；AI代理在系统枚举、并行利用和成本方面有优势。

Conclusion: AI代理有优势，但存在误报率高和难以处理基于GUI任务的能力差距。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive evaluation of AI agents against human cybersecurity professionals in a live enterprise environment. We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks.

Abstract: Metadata vocabularies are essential for advancing FAIR and FARR data principles, but their development constrained by limited human resources and inconsistent standardization practices. This paper introduces MatSci-YAMZ, a platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and human-in-the-loop (HILT), including crowdsourcing, to support metadata vocabulary development. The paper reports on a proof-of-concept use case evaluating the AI-HILT model in materials science, a highly interdisciplinary domain Six (6) participants affiliated with the NSF Institute for Data-Driven Dynamical Design (ID4) engaged with the MatSci-YAMZ plaform over several weeks, contributing term definitions and providing examples to prompt the AI-definitions refinement. Nineteen (19) AI-generated definitions were successfully created, with iterative feedback loops demonstrating the feasibility of AI-HILT refinement. Findings confirm the feasibility AI-HILT model highlighting 1) a successful proof of concept, 2) alignment with FAIR and open-science principles, 3) a research protocol to guide future studies, and 4) the potential for scalability across domains. Overall, MatSci-YAMZ's underlying model has the capacity to enhance semantic transparency and reduce time required for consensus building and metadata vocabulary development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SCOPE方法解决复杂文本环境长期规划难题，效率高且效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的规划方法计算成本高、难部署且无法适应目标任务。

Method: 引入SCOPE，仅在初始化时利用大语言模型生成子目标预训练轻量级学生模型，直接从示例轨迹中获取子目标。

Result: 在TextCraft环境中，成功率达0.56（ADaPT为0.52），推理时间从164.4秒降至3.0秒。

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成的子目标可作为文本规划任务分层目标分解的良好起点，SCOPE方法效率高。

Abstract: Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.

Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种用于复方药丸的自动化设计框架，利用拓扑优化使溶出行为与规定的药物释放动力学相匹配，并通过案例验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前复方药丸配方依赖临时参数扫描，现有设计流程不适合系统探索形状、成分和释放行为的高维空间。

Method: 采用超形状参数化定义几何/相分布，用神经网络表示指定辅料分布，通过修改的Allen - Cahn和Fick扩散方程的耦合系统控制溶出动力学，在JAX中实现框架并利用自动微分计算灵敏度以共同优化药丸形状和成分分布。

Result: 通过单相和多辅料案例研究验证了该方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动化设计框架可有效应用于复方药丸设计，解决现有设计流程的不足。

Abstract: Polypills are single oral dosage forms that combine multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients, enabling fixed-dose combination therapies, coordinated multi-phase release, and precise customization of patient-specific treatment protocols. Recent advances in additive manufacturing facilitate the physical realization of multi-material excipients, offering superior customization of target release profiles. However, polypill formulations remain tuned by ad hoc parameter sweeps; this reliance renders current design workflows ill-suited for the systematic exploration of the high-dimensional space of shapes, compositions, and release behaviors.
  We present an automated design framework for polypills that leverages topology optimization to match dissolution behaviors with prescribed drug release kinetics. In particular, we employ a supershape parametrization to define geometry/phase distribution, a neural network representation to specify excipient distribution, and a coupled system of modified Allen-Cahn and Fick's diffusion equations to govern dissolution kinetics. The framework is implemented in JAX, utilizing automatic differentiation to compute sensitivities for the co-optimization of pill shape and constituent distribution. We validate the method through single-phase and multi-excipient case studies.

Conclusion: 所提方法支持不同制造系统的可靠决策。

Abstract: Industrial cyber physical systems operate under heterogeneous sensing, stochastic dynamics, and shifting process conditions, producing data that are often incomplete, unlabeled, imbalanced, and domain shifted. High-fidelity datasets remain costly, confidential, and slow to obtain, while edge devices face strict limits on latency, bandwidth, and energy. These factors restrict the practicality of centralized deep learning, hinder the development of reliable digital twins, and increase the risk of error escape in safety-critical applications. Motivated by these challenges, this dissertation develops an efficiency grounded computational framework that enables data lean, physics-aware, and deployment ready intelligence for modern manufacturing environments. The research advances methods that collectively address core bottlenecks across multimodal and multiscale industrial scenarios. Generative strategies mitigate data scarcity and imbalance, while semi-supervised learning integrates unlabeled information to reduce annotation and simulation demands. Physics-informed representation learning strengthens interpretability and improves condition monitoring under small-data regimes. Spatially aware graph-based surrogate modeling provides efficient approximation of complex processes, and an edge cloud collaborative compression scheme supports real-time signal analytics under resource constraints. The dissertation also extends visual understanding through zero-shot vision language reasoning augmented by domain specific retrieval, enabling generalizable assessment in previously unseen scenarios. Together, these developments establish a unified paradigm of data efficient and resource aware intelligence that bridges laboratory learning with industrial deployment, supporting reliable decision-making across diverse manufacturing systems.

Motivation: 现有金融基准无法评估模型现实世界安全行为，存在多方面不足，需新基准。

Method: 引入CNFinBench，采用金融定制红队对话，基于能力 - 合规 - 安全三元组；引入HICS量化安全；强制输出格式，用混合LLM集成加人工校准评判。

Conclusion: 模型存在能力 - 合规差距，仅拒绝有害提示不能保证安全，需引用和可验证推理。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across the financial sector for tasks such as research, compliance, risk analysis, and customer service, which makes rigorous safety evaluation essential. However, existing financial benchmarks primarily focus on textbook-style question answering and numerical problem solving, but fail to evaluate models' real-world safety behaviors. They weakly assess regulatory compliance and investor-protection norms, rarely stress-test multi-turn adversarial tactics such as jailbreaks or prompt injection, inconsistently ground answers in long filings, ignore tool- or RAG-induced over-reach risks, and rely on opaque or non-auditable evaluation protocols. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark that employs finance-tailored red-team dialogues and is structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad, including evidence-grounded reasoning over long reports and jurisdiction-aware rule/tax compliance tasks. For systematic safety quantification, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to measure how consistently models resist harmful prompts across multi-turn adversarial dialogues. To ensure auditability, CNFinBench enforces strict output formats with dynamic option perturbation for objective tasks and employs a hybrid LLM-ensemble plus human-calibrated judge for open-ended evaluations. Experiments on 21 models across 15 subtasks confirm a persistent capability-compliance gap: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but fall to 34.18 on compliance and risk-control evaluations. Under multi-turn adversarial dialogue tests, most systems reach only partial resistance (HICS 60-79), demonstrating that refusal alone is not a reliable proxy for safety without cited and verifiable reasoning.

Conclusion: 此方法可应对现有挑战，推动未来土壤质量系统更透明、自适应和符合可持续土地管理。

Abstract: Soil quality (SQ) plays a crucial role in sustainable agriculture, environmental conservation, and land-use planning. Traditional SQ assessment techniques rely on costly, labor-intensive sampling and laboratory analysis, limiting their spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and machine learning (ML) enabled efficient SQ evaluation. This paper presents a comprehensive roadmap distinguishing it from previous reviews by proposing a unified and modular pipeline that integrates multi-source soil data, GIS and remote sensing tools, and machine learning techniques to support transparent and scalable soil quality assessment. It also includes practical applications. Contrary to existing studies that predominantly target isolated soil parameters or specific modeling methodologies, this approach consolidates recent advancements in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing technologies, and machine learning algorithms within the entire soil quality assessment pipeline. It also addresses existing challenges and limitations while exploring future developments and emerging trends in the field that can deliver the next generation of soil quality systems making them more transparent, adaptive, and aligned with sustainable land management.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动的基数估计方法不能同时保证低推理延迟和可扩展性，随数据维度增长优化时间可能超查询执行时间，且结果不稳定。

Result: 能在保持高精度的同时实现快速且近乎恒定的推理速度，比现有数据驱动基数估计器快10倍以上。

Conclusion: 该方法具有出色的维度扩展性，适合实际数据库应用。

Abstract: Modern database optimizer relies on cardinality estimator, whose accuracy directly affects the optimizer's ability to choose an optimal execution plan. Recent work on data-driven methods has leveraged probabilistic models to achieve higher estimation accuracy, but these approaches cannot guarantee low inference latency at the same time and neglect scalability. As data dimensionality grows, optimization time can even exceed actual query execution time. Furthermore, inference with probabilistic models by sampling or integration procedures unpredictable estimation result and violate stability, which brings unstable performance with query execution and make database tuning hard for database users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to cardinality estimation based on cumulative distribution function(CDF), which calculates range query cardinality without sampling or integration, ensuring accurate and predictable estimation results. With inference acceleration by merging calculations, we can achieve fast and nearly constant inference speed while maintaining high accuracy, even as dimensionality increases, which is over 10x faster than current state-of-the-art data-driven cardinality estimator. This demonstrates its excellent dimensional scalability, making it well-suited for real-world database applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RAG包含结构化数据，表与向量搜索的工作负载增多时，向量搜索组件基数估计不准导致查询计划不佳，需要解决此问题。

Method: 提出Exqutor，有可用向量索引时运用精确基数查询优化技术，无索引时采用自适应采样方法。

Result: 将框架集成到pgvector、VBASE和DuckDB，向量增强分析查询性能提升达四个数量级。

Conclusion: Exqutor可高效近似向量搜索基数，同时最小化计算成本。

Abstract: Vector similarity search is becoming increasingly important for data science pipelines, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where it enhances large language model inference by enabling efficient retrieval of relevant external knowledge. As RAG expands with table-augmented generation to incorporate structured data, workloads integrating table and vector search are becoming more prevalent. However, efficiently executing such queries remains challenging due to inaccurate cardinality estimation for vector search components, leading to suboptimal query plans. In this paper, we propose Exqutor, an extended query optimizer for vector-augmented analytical queries. Exqutor is a pluggable cardinality estimation framework designed to address this issue, leveraging exact cardinality query optimization techniques to enhance estimation accuracy when vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF) are available. In scenarios lacking these indexes, we employ a sampling-based approach with adaptive sampling size adjustment, dynamically tuning the sample size to balance estimation accuracy and sampling overhead. This allows Exqutor to efficiently approximate vector search cardinalities while minimizing computational costs. We integrate our framework into pgvector, VBASE, and DuckDB, demonstrating performance improvements of up to four orders of magnitude on vector-augmented analytical queries.

Motivation: 解决数据在多维度（时间突变、空间协作、设计变更）的变更支持，以及架构演化中的挑战问题。

Method: 采用操作差分（Operational Differencing）技术构建数据版本控制，对查询语言片段进行操作化处理。

Result: 实现了细粒度的差异比较和合并，提供简化版本控制概念模型，操作化查询能适应架构变更，解决四个架构演化挑战问题。

Conclusion: 操作差分技术可有效支持多维度数据变更和版本控制，操作化查询有一定可行性。

Abstract: Baseline is a platform for richly structured data supporting change in multiple dimensions: mutation over time, collaboration across space, and evolution through design changes. It is built upon Operational Differencing, a new technique for managing data in terms of high-level operations that include refactorings and schema changes. We use operational differencing to construct an operation-based form of version control on data structures used in programming languages and relational databases. This approach to data version control does fine-grained diffing and merging despite intervening structural transformations like schema changes. It offers users a simplified conceptual model of version control for ad hoc usage: There is no repo; Branching is just copying. The informaton maintained in a repo can be synthesized more precisely from the append-only histories of branches. Branches can be flexibly shared as is commonly done with document files, except with the added benefit of diffing and merging. We conjecture that queries can be operationalized into a sequence of schema and data operations. We develop that idea on a query language fragment containing selects and joins. Operationalized queries are represented as a future timeline that is speculatively executed as a branch off of the present state, returning a value from its hypothetical future. Operationalized queries get rewritten to accommodate schema change "for free" by the machinery of operational differencing. Altogether we develop solutions to four of the eight challenge problems of schema evolution identified in a recent paper.

Method: 实现并开源使用余因子进行数据库内因式分解学习的代码，在PostgreSQL和HyPer上进行学习线性回归的基准测试

Result: 内存数据库系统上因式分解学习比非因式分解学习性能提升70%，比磁盘数据库系统性能提升100倍

Conclusion: 现代数据库引擎可通过预计算聚合来加速机器学习训练

Abstract: Learning models over factorized joins avoids redundant computations by identifying and pre-computing shared cofactors. Previous work has investigated the performance gain when computing cofactors on traditional disk-based database systems. Due to the absence of published code, the experiments could not be reproduced on in-memory database systems. This work describes the implementation when using cofactors for in-database factorized learning. We benchmark our open-source implementation for learning linear regression on factorized joins with PostgreSQL -- as a disk-based database system -- and HyPer -- as an in-memory engine. The evaluation shows a performance gain of factorized learning on in-memory database systems by 70\% to non-factorized learning and by a factor of 100 compared to disk-based database systems. Thus, modern database engines can contribute to the machine learning pipeline by pre-computing aggregates prior to data extraction to accelerate training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决专家并行（EP）中GPU负载不均衡的方法，在内存受限场景下会降低性能，需新方法。

Method: 提出METRO算法，平衡每个GPU激活的专家数量，联合优化算法效率并利用GPU并行处理能力，采用新的allGather方案。

Result: 在真实系统和模拟器上与EPLB对比，METRO降低解码延迟11 - 22%，总令牌吞吐量提升3 - 21%，在固定解码服务水平目标下，解码吞吐量最高提升4.11倍。

Conclusion: METRO算法在内存受限的专家并行MoE服务中表现良好，能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Expert Parallelism (EP) permits Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to scale beyond a single GPU. To address load imbalance across GPUs in EP, existing approaches aim to balance the number of tokens each GPU processes. Surprisingly, we find that this objective degrades performance rather than improving it when processing is memory-bound - a common occurrence in MoE serving, especially in the decode phase. Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.
  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed. In addition, by trading latency headroom for throughput, METRO improves decode throughput by up to 4.11x over EPLB at a fixed decode SLO.

Result: 应用于SAM模型表明该框架显著增强内容隐私，能保持接近基线的分割性能，降低内容重建和用户数据暴露的风险。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘 - 云连续体中的视觉任务提供了可扩展、保护隐私的解决方案。

Abstract: Nowadays, visual intelligence tools have become ubiquitous, offering all kinds of convenience and possibilities. However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum.

Conclusion: BatANN是首个基于单一全局图运行的开源分布式磁盘向量搜索系统。

Abstract: Vector search underpins modern information-retrieval systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and search engines over unstructured text and images. As datasets scale to billions of vectors, disk-based vector search has emerged as a practical solution. However, looking to the future, we need to anticipate datasets too large for any single server. We present BatANN, a distributed disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) system that retains the logarithmic search efficiency of a single global graph while achieving near-linear throughput scaling in the number of servers. Our core innovation is that when accessing a neighborhood which is stored on another machine, we send the full state of the query to the other machine to continue executing there for improved locality. On 100M- and 1B-point datasets at 0.95 recall using 10 servers, BatANN achieves 6.21-6.49x and 2.5-5.10x the throughput of the scatter-gather baseline, respectively, while maintaining mean latency below 6 ms. Moreover, we get these results on standard TCP. To our knowledge, BatANN is the first open-source distributed disk-based vector search system to operate over a single global graph.

Result: 在真实数据集评估中，WarmServe与基于自动缩放的系统相比，TTFT最多提升50.8倍，与GPU共享系统相比，能处理多2.5倍的请求。

Conclusion: WarmServe系统能有效改善推理性能和服务请求处理能力。

Abstract: Deploying multiple models within shared GPU clusters is promising for improving resource efficiency in large language model (LLM) serving. Existing multi-LLM serving systems optimize GPU utilization at the cost of worse inference performance, especially time-to-first-token (TTFT). We identify the root cause of such compromise as their unawareness of future workload characteristics. In contrast, recent analysis on real-world traces has shown the high periodicity and long-term predictability of LLM serving workloads.
  We propose universal GPU workers to enable one-for-many GPU prewarming that loads models with knowledge of future workloads. Based on universal GPU workers, we design and build WarmServe, a multi-LLM serving system that (1) mitigates cluster-wide prewarming interference by adopting an evict-aware model placement strategy, (2) prepares universal GPU workers in advance by proactive prewarming, and (3) manages GPU memory with a zero-overhead memory switching mechanism. Evaluation under real-world datasets shows that WarmServe improves TTFT by up to 50.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art autoscaling-based system, while being capable of serving up to 2.5$\times$ more requests compared to the GPU-sharing system.

Abstract: Diverse scientific and engineering research areas deal with discrete, time-stamped changes in large systems of interacting delay differential equations. Simulating such complex systems at scale on high-performance computing clusters demands efficient management of communication and memory. Inspired by the human cerebral cortex -- a sparsely connected network of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ neurons, each forming $\mathcal{O}(10^{3})$--$\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ synapses and communicating via short electrical pulses called spikes -- we study the simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience research. This work presents a novel network construction method for multi-GPU clusters and upcoming exascale supercomputers using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), where each process builds its local connectivity and prepares the data structures for efficient spike exchange across the cluster during state propagation. We demonstrate scaling performance of two cortical models using point-to-point and collective communication, respectively.

Conclusion: PHWSOA在实际云环境资源管理上具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Task scheduling is a critical research challenge in cloud computing, a transformative technology widely adopted across industries. Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings.

Motivation: 当前对基于GPU的深度学习训练中拖后腿现象的普遍性、原因、影响及现有缓解方法的有效性研究不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 进行全面实验，发现问题后提出STAR系统，包括新同步模式、选择最优同步模式的方法、资源重新分配及主动预防拖后腿的策略。

Result: 在AWS上的跟踪驱动评估表明，STAR在PS和全归约架构中比现有系统分别降低48 - 84%和51 - 70%的TTA，且保持SSGD的收敛精度。

Conclusion: STAR系统能有效解决基于GPU的深度学习训练中的拖后腿问题，降低TTA，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of homogeneous GPU-based deep learning (DL) training, the prevalence, causes and impact of stragglers and the effectiveness of existing straggler mitigation approaches are still not well understood in this scenario due to limited research on these questions. To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD. The code for STAR is open-sourced.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop new $(1+ε)$-approximation algorithms for finding the global minimum edge-cut in a directed edge-weighted graph, and for finding the global minimum vertex-cut in a directed vertex-weighted graph. Our algorithms are randomized, and have a running time of $O\left(m^{1+o(1)}/ε\right)$ on any $m$-edge $n$-vertex input graph, assuming all edge/vertex weights are polynomially-bounded. In particular, for any constant $ε>0$, our algorithms have an almost-optimal running time of $O\left(m^{1+o(1)}\right)$. The fastest previously-known running time for this setting, due to (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), is $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{n^2/ε^2,m^{1+o(1)}\sqrt{n}\right\}\right)$ for Minimum Edge-Cut, and $\tilde{O}\left(n^2/ε^2\right)$ for Minimum Vertex-Cut. Our results further extend to the rooted variants of the Minimum Edge-Cut and Minimum Vertex-Cut problems, where the algorithm is additionally given a root vertex $r$, and the goal is to find a minimum-weight cut separating any vertex from the root $r$. In terms of techniques, we build upon and extend a framework that was recently introduced by (Chuzhoy et al., SODA 2026) for solving the Minimum Vertex-Cut problem in unweighted directed graphs. Additionally, in order to obtain our result for the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem, we develop a novel black-box reduction from this problem to its rooted variant. Prior to our work, such reductions were only known for more restricted settings, such as when all vertex-weights are unit.

TL;DR: 提出随机算法高效维护(Δ + 1)着色，适应多模型并在各模型有良好结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计能在图的边插入和删除更新时高效维护(Δ + 1)着色的算法，且适应并行和分布式模型

Method: 提出简单随机算法，可同时处理多个更新

Result: 顺序设置下每次更新期望时间O(1)；并行设置下每批更新每更新期望工作O(1)，深度poly(log n)；分布式设置下能维护着色，更新后快速收敛，每更新消息复杂度和计算O(1)

Conclusion: 该算法在不同模型下都有高效表现，提供统一框架

Abstract: We present a simple randomized algorithm that can efficiently maintain a $(Δ+1)$ coloring as the graph undergoes edge insertion and deletion updates, where $Δ$ denotes an upper bound on the maximum degree. A key advantage is the algorithm's ability to process many updates simultaneously, which makes it naturally adaptable to the parallel and distributed models. Concretely, it gives a unified framework across the models, leading to the following results:
  - In the sequential setting, the algorithm processes each update in $O(1)$ expected time, worst-case. This matches and strengthens the results of Henzinger and Peng [TALG 2022] and Bhattacharya et al. [TALG 2022], who achieved an $O(1)$ bound but amortized (in expectation and with high probability, respectively), whose work was an improvement of the $O(\log Δ)$ expected amortized bound of Bhattacharya et al. [SODA'18].
  - In the parallel setting, the algorithm processes each (arbitrary size) batch of updates using $O(1)$ work per update in the batch in expectation, and in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth with high probability. This is, in a sense, an ideal parallelization of the above results.
  - In the distributed setting, the algorithm can maintain a coloring of the network graph as (potentially many) edges are added or deleted. The maintained coloring is always proper; it may become partial upon updates, i.e., some nodes may temporarily lose their colors, but quickly converges to a full, proper coloring. Concretely, each insertion and deletion causes at most $O(1)$ nodes to become uncolored, but this is resolved within $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability (e.g., in the absence of further updates nearby--the precise guarantee is stronger, but technical). Importantly, the algorithm incurs only $O(1)$ expected message complexity and computation per update.

Result: 模型未收敛到统一最优行为，存在锚定效应，部分模型有系统优势。

Conclusion: 部署此类系统到现实场景前，需开发机制缓解相关问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents on behalf of institutions and individuals in economic, political, and social settings that involve negotiation. Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts. These findings underscore an urgent need to develop mechanisms to mitigate these issues before deploying such systems in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 设计的学习增强和容错拍卖在不同预测准确性情况下能取得较好节俭率。

Abstract: We study the problem of designing procurement auctions for the strategic uncapacitated facility location problem: a company needs to procure a set of facility locations in order to serve its customers and each facility location is owned by a strategic agent. Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate the performance of these auctions using the \emph{frugality ratio}.
  We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners' private costs. Specifically, we propose a family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions. We finally provide a family of ``error-tolerant'' auctions that maintain improved frugality ratios even if the predictions are only approximately accurate, and we provide upper bounds on their frugality ratio as a function of the prediction error.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformer architectures have shown impressive reasoning and generation capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, their reliability and robustness in real-world engineering domains remain largely unexplored, limiting their practical utility in human-centric workflows. In this work, we investigate the applicability and consistency of LLMs for analog circuit design -- a task requiring domain-specific reasoning, adherence to physical constraints, and structured representations -- focusing on AI-assisted design where humans remain in the loop. We study how different data representations influence model behavior and compare smaller models (e.g., T5, GPT-2) with larger foundation models (e.g., Mistral-7B, GPT-oss-20B) under varying training conditions. Our results highlight key reliability challenges, including sensitivity to data format, instability in generated designs, and limited generalization to unseen circuit configurations. These findings provide early evidence on the limits and potential of LLMs as tools to enhance human capabilities in complex engineering tasks, offering insights into designing reliable, deployable foundation models for structured, real-world applications.

Result: 在小表格环境中贝叶斯ATM有更好回报且方差低、策略更稳定，在复杂mHealth场景标准和贝叶斯ATM表现均差。

Conclusion: 低数据场景下不确定性感知方法有价值，需新算法明确建模因果结构等。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in mobile health (mHealth) interventions requires balancing intervention efficacy with user burden, particularly when state measurements (for example, user surveys or feedback) are costly yet essential. The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.

Result: TinyDéjàVu可节省超60%的RAM使用，消除最多90%的重叠滑动窗口输入的冗余计算。

Conclusion: TinyDéjàVu框架和算法在优化小内存硬件上的神经网络推理数据流动方面效果显著。

Abstract: Always-on sensors are increasingly expected to embark a variety of tiny neural networks and to continuously perform inference on time-series of the data they sense. In order to fit lifetime and energy consumption requirements when operating on battery, such hardware uses microcontrollers (MCUs) with tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. In this context, optimizing data flows across neural network layers becomes crucial. In this paper, we introduce TinyDéjàVu, a new framework and novel algorithms we designed to drastically reduce the RAM footprint required by inference using various tiny ML models for sensor data time-series on typical microcontroller hardware. We publish the implementation of TinyDéjàVu as open source, and we perform reproducible benchmarks on hardware. We show that TinyDéjàVu can save more than 60% of RAM usage and eliminate up to 90% of redundant compute on overlapping sliding window inputs.

Abstract: Testing humanoid robots with users is slow, causes wear, and limits iteration and diversity. Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling clinician-supervised humanoid pilots.

Conclusion: 所提方法对蛋白质语言模型和蛋白质系统具有通用性，能有效改进蛋白质序列生成。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for adapting large language models to specialized domains, yet its application to protein sequence modeling and protein language models (PLMs) remains ad hoc. This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures.

Abstract: Inferring the eventual goal of a mobile agent from noisy observations of its trajectory is a fundamental estimation problem. We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one. Experiments illustrate fast and accurate intent recovery for compliant agents, motivating future work on designing intent-obfuscating controllers.

Abstract: Low-power microcontroller (MCU) hardware is currently evolving from single-core architectures to predominantly multi-core architectures. In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图分析需专业知识，虽有自监督学习和基础模型可减少对人类专业知识的依赖，但缺乏对基础模型在心电图上表现的综合分析，故研究基础模型对心电图分析是否有用。

Conclusion: 指出基础模型在推进生理波形分析中的局限性和潜力。

Abstract: In the process of patient diagnosis, non-invasive measurements are widely used due to their low risks and quick results. Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a non-invasive method to collect heart activities, is used to diagnose cardiac conditions. Analyzing the ECG typically requires domain expertise, which is a roadblock to applying artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare. Through advances in self-supervised learning and foundation models, AI systems can now acquire and leverage domain knowledge without relying solely on human expertise. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses over the foundation models' performance on ECG. This study aims to answer the research question: "Are Foundation Models Useful for ECG Analysis?" To address it, we evaluate language/general time-series/ECG foundation models in comparison with time-series deep learning models. The experimental results show that general time-series/ECG foundation models achieve a top performance rate of 80%, indicating their effectiveness in ECG analysis. In-depth analyses and insights are provided along with comprehensive experimental results. This study highlights the limitations and potential of foundation models in advancing physiological waveform analysis. The data and code for this benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/yuhaoxu99/ECGMultitasks-Benchmark.

Motivation: XL - MIMO在混合场信道中传统估计方法效果不佳，大语言模型在下游任务微调表现好，推动提出新的信道估计框架。

Method: 提出LLM4XCE框架，集成嵌入模块和并行特征 - 空间注意力，微调顶部两层Transformer。

Result: 广泛模拟显示LLM4XCE在混合场条件下显著优于现有方法，有更好的估计精度和泛化性能。

Conclusion: LLM4XCE是一种有效的XL - MIMO信道估计方法，能在混合场信道中取得良好效果。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a key enabler for sixth-generation (6G) networks, offering massive spatial degrees of freedom. Despite these advantages, the coexistence of near-field and far-field effects in hybrid-field channels presents significant challenges for accurate estimation, where traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.
  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM4XCE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under hybrid-field conditions, achieving superior estimation accuracy and generalization performance.

Result: 提出从查询中学习任意近似低logit秩模型的高效算法。

Conclusion: 结果为可能捕捉现代语言模型的生成模型给出首个端到端学习保证，结构假设反映语言模型经验行为。

Abstract: While modern language models and their inner workings are incredibly complex, recent work (Golowich, Liu & Shetty; 2025) has proposed a simple and potentially tractable abstraction for them through the observation that empirically, these language models all seem to have approximately low logit rank. Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.
  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.

TL;DR: 提出DW - KNN改进KNN，综合评估显示其有高准确率、低方差，是复杂自适应方案的有效替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准距离加权KNN及其变体假设所有k个邻居同等可靠，在异构特征空间中限制了预测可靠性。

Method: 提出DW - KNN，将指数距离与邻居有效性相结合。

Result: 在9个数据集上平均准确率达0.8988，排名第二，交叉验证方差最低，统计显著性测试显示优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DW - KNN是复杂自适应方案的简单有效替代，对需要可解释预测的高风险应用有价值。

Abstract: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the most used ML classifiers. However, if we observe closely, standard distance-weighted KNN and relative variants assume all 'k' neighbors are equally reliable. In heterogeneous feature space, this becomes a limitation that hinders reliability in predicting true levels of the observation.
  We propose DW-KNN (Double Weighted KNN), a transparent and robust variant that integrates exponential distance with neighbor validity. This enables instance-level interpretability, suppresses noisy or mislabeled samples, and reduces hyperparameter sensitivity.
  Comprehensive evaluation on 9 data-sets helps to demonstrate that DW-KNN achieves 0.8988 accuracy on average. It ranks 2nd among six methods and within 0.2% of the best-performing Ensemble KNN. It also exhibits the lowest cross-validation variance (0.0156), indicating reliable prediction stability. Statistical significance test confirmed ($p < 0.001$) improvement over compactness weighted KNN (+4.09\%) and Kernel weighted KNN (+1.13\%). The method provides a simple yet effective alternative to complex adaptive schemes, particularly valuable for high-stakes applications requiring explainable predictions.

Motivation: 传统基于特定任务模型和领域特征工程的用户行为预测方法耗时、计算成本高、需专业知识且不可扩展，因此需新方法。

Method: 提出LUMOS架构，引入新的跨注意力机制，利用未来已知事件辅助预测，采用多模态标记法结合多信息源，通过专业嵌入路径处理。

Result: 在生产数据集上实验，LUMOS在多个任务上优于传统模型，二分类任务ROC - AUC平均提升0.025，回归任务MAPE降低4.6%；线上A/B测试显示日活用户增加3.15%。

Conclusion: LUMOS架构在用户行为预测上有良好表现，能带来实际业务提升。

Abstract: User behavior prediction at scale remains a critical challenge for online B2C platforms. Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering. This is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise and therefore not scalable. We present LUMOS (Large User MOdel Series), a transformer-based architecture that eliminates task-specific models and manual feature engineering by learning multiple tasks jointly using only raw user activity data. LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behaviour patterns like "how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user transactions, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways.
  Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 275 billion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks. Online A/B testing validates these improvements translate to measurable business impact with a 3.15\% increase in Daily Active Users.

Result: 在NLP和视觉基准测试中，PS - LoRA能在有效适应新领域的同时保持学到表示的稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PS - LoRA可解决LoRA的灾难性遗忘问题，在持续学习中表现良好。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient Continual Learning but often suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to destructive interference between tasks. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by antagonistic directional updates where new task gradients directly oppose the historical weight trajectory. To address this, we propose PS-LoRA (Parameter Stability LoRA), a framework designed to resolve conflicts by aligning updates within the optimization subspace. Our approach employs a dual-regularization objective that penalizes conflicting directions and constrains magnitude deviations to ensure consistency with prior knowledge. Additionally, we implement a magnitude-based merging strategy to consolidate sequential adapters into a robust representation without retraining. Experiments on NLP and Vision benchmarks show that PS-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by preserving the stability of learned representations while efficiently adapting to new domains.

Conclusion: 等变网络虽有表达能力受限问题，但可通过增大模型规模解决，且有更好的泛化性。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks.

Result: 论文给出谱公式、攻击算法，并在基准上进行了实验。

Conclusion: SEA攻击在图级别操作，模型感知且概念简单，可插入现有GNN架构，无需梯度。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on graph-structured data, but are notoriously vulnerable to small, carefully crafted perturbations of the graph structure. Most existing structure-based attacks rely on gradient-based heuristics or local connectivity patterns, and treat edges as equally important candidates for manipulation. In this paper, we propose Spectral Edge Attacks (SEA), a new family of adversarial attacks that explicitly leverage spectral robustness evaluation to guide structural perturbations. Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space. Both attacks operate at the graph level, are model-aware but conceptually simple, and can be plugged into existing GNN architectures without requiring gradients. We describe the spectral formulation, the attack algorithms, and experiments on benchmarks.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) struggle with complex, interdependent instructions, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance where precision is critical. We introduce FIFE, a novel, high-difficulty benchmark designed to assess LM instruction-following capabilities for financial analysis tasks. FIFE comprises 88 human-authored prompts and employs a verification system with chainable, verifiable constraints for fine-grained reward signals. We evaluate 53 models (proprietary, open-weight, open-source) in a zero-shot setting. Our key findings reveal a clear performance hierarchy: the top open-weight model (76.1 strict / 79.5 loose) surpasses the leading proprietary system (65.9 strict / 70.5 loose), while the best open-source models lag significantly (45.5 strict / 48.9 loose). However, even top-performing models struggle with FIFE's complex requirements, failing to achieve perfect compliance. We release our dataset and code as an open-source resource to promote research in Reinforcement Learning for the financial domain.

Result: 在各种下游任务和越狱防御场景的实验中，该方法在鲁棒性边界和计算效率上优于现有认证方法。

Conclusion: CluCERT 框架有效解决了现有大语言模型鲁棒性认证方法的局限，有更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread adoption in daily applications. Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: StructuredDNA为未来稀疏计算框架建立了稳健、领域无关范式，提供生物物理原理与稀疏专家路由联系，指出未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large computational models has led to a critical increase in energy and compute costs. Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.
  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.
  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms. The StructuredDNA implementation is available at https://github.com/InnoDeep-repos/StructuredDNA .

Abstract: We propose the Uncertainty Contrastive Framework (UCF), a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) representation learning framework that integrates uncertainty-aware contrastive loss, adaptive temperature scaling, and a self-attention-guided LSTM encoder to improve classification under noisy and imbalanced conditions. UCF dynamically adjusts contrastive weighting based on sample confidence, stabilizes training using positive anchors, and adapts temperature parameters to batch-level variability. Applied to malicious content classification, UCF-generated embeddings enable multiple traditional classifiers to achieve more than 93.38% accuracy, precision above 0.93, and near-perfect recall, with minimal false negatives and competitive ROC-AUC scores. Visual analyses confirm clear separation between positive and unlabeled instances, highlighting the framework's ability to produce calibrated, discriminative embeddings. These results position UCF as a robust and scalable solution for PU learning in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity and biomedical text mining.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of urban air pollution is essential for protecting public health and guiding mitigation policies. While Deep Learning (DL) and hybrid pipelines dominate recent research, their complexity and limited interpretability hinder operational use. This study investigates whether lightweight additive models -- Facebook Prophet (FBP) and NeuralProphet (NP) -- can deliver competitive forecasts for particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$) in Beijing, China. Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants. These findings demonstrate that interpretable additive models remain competitive with both traditional and complex approaches, offering a practical balance of accuracy, transparency, and ease of deployment.

Method: 提出CRM方法，通过系统地屏蔽标注区域，并将推理痕迹与未屏蔽的基线进行对比，以提供因果性、步骤级别的归因。

Result: 应用于VisArgs等数据集，揭示了模型的不同失败模式，如部分模型保留推理结构但在证据缺失时会产生幻觉，部分模型紧密依赖视觉线索但在扰动下崩溃。

Conclusion: 将评估从答案的正确性转移到推理的忠实性，将视觉基准重新定义为诊断工具，强调需要多模态评估框架来衡量推理的性能、鲁棒性和保真度。

Abstract: We introduce Contrastive Region Masking (CRM), a training free diagnostic that reveals how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) depend on specific visual regions at each step of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Unlike prior approaches limited to final answers or attention maps, CRM provides causal, step-level attri- bution by systematically masking annotated regions and contrasting the resulting reasoning traces with unmasked baselines. Applied to datasets such as VisArgs, CRM reveals distinct failure modes: some models preserve reasoning structure, but hallucinate when evidence is missing, while others ground tightly to visual cues yet collapse under perturbations. By shifting the evaluation from correctness of an- swers to faithfulness of reasoning, CRM reframes visual benchmarks as diagnostic tools, highlighting the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that measure not just performance, but also robustness and fidelity of reasoning.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms remain a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide, where rupture risk is tightly coupled to local hemodynamics particularly wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index. Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.
  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.
  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside aneurysm analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable probability predictions are essential for multi-class supervised learning tasks, where well-calibrated models enable rational decision-making. While isotonic regression has proven effective for binary calibration, its extension to multi-class problems via one-vs-rest calibration produced suboptimal results when compared to parametric methods, limiting its practical adoption. In this work, we propose novel isotonic normalization-aware techniques for multiclass calibration, grounded in natural and intuitive assumptions expected by practitioners. Unlike prior approaches, our methods inherently account for probability normalization by either incorporating normalization directly into the optimization process (NA-FIR) or modeling the problem as a cumulative bivariate isotonic regression (SCIR). Empirical evaluation on a variety of text and image classification datasets across different model architectures reveals that our approach consistently improves negative log-likelihood (NLL) and expected calibration error (ECE) metrics.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is essential for hydrometeorological risk management, especially for anticipating extreme rainfall that can lead to flash flooding and infrastructure damage. This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making. This work advances DL-based precipitation forecasting by enhancing predictive skill, reliability, and applicability across regions.

Conclusion: 该方法虽有局限性，如难以解释原子结构的OOD偏移，但为理解模型泛化能力提供了思路，可结合其他技术进一步研究。

Abstract: Neural networks, while effective for tackling many challenging scientific tasks, are not known to perform well out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., within domains which differ from their training data. Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. Lastly, we consider limitations of our approach in explaining other OOD shifts, such as of the atomic structures, and discuss complementary techniques for understanding generalization in such settings.

Conclusion: DeepTherm可在无热相关死亡率历史数据的情况下进行致命热浪预测，有良好性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Severe heatwaves in urban areas significantly threaten public health, calling for establishing early warning strategies. Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history. By highlighting the flexibility of deep learning, DeepTherm employs a dual-prediction pipeline, disentangling baseline mortality in the absence of heatwaves and other irregular events from all-cause mortality. We evaluated DeepTherm on real-world data across Spain. Results demonstrate consistent, robust, and accurate performance across diverse regions, time periods, and population groups while allowing trade-off between missed alarms and false alarms.

Motivation: 现有Kolmogorov - Arnold Networks (KANs)存在参数效率低的问题，需改进。

Method: 受David Sprecher的叠加定理改进启发，通过对每层单个可学习的共享父函数应用可学习的线性变换来构建唯一边缘函数。

Result: GS - KAN在连续函数逼近任务上优于MLPs和标准KAN基线，在表格回归中与现有KAN架构表现相当，在高维分类任务上优于MLPs。

Conclusion: GS - KAN能在严格参数约束的高维场景中部署KAN架构，解决了标准实现因参数爆炸不可行的问题。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem offers a theoretical alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate functions on edges rather than nodes. While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

Abstract: Data attribution methods identify which training examples are responsible for a model's predictions, but their sensitivity to distributional perturbations undermines practical reliability. We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution. Furthermore, we prove that the Self-Influence term arising from our analysis equals the Lipschitz constant governing attribution stability, providing theoretical grounding for leverage-based anomaly detection. Empirically, Self-Influence achieves 0.970 AUROC for label noise detection, identifying 94.1\% of corrupted labels by examining just the top 20\% of training data.

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的采样程序有一定优势，但在处理域外数据和精细调优准确率 - 效率平衡上存在挑战。

Abstract: Diffusion (Large) Language Models (dLLMs) now match the downstream performance of their autoregressive counterparts on many tasks, while holding the promise of being more efficient during inference. One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.

Conclusion: SEDONet 对 DeepONets 是简单、参数中性的改进，为有界域 PDEs 代理建模提供稳健高效的谱框架。

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have become a central tool in data-driven operator learning, providing flexible surrogates for nonlinear mappings arising in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.

Abstract: Transformers and more specifically decoder-only transformers dominate modern LLM architectures. While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space.

Abstract: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis, a life-threatening cardiovascular condition. Multiple transcatheter heart valves (THV) have been approved for use in TAVR, but current guidelines regarding valve type prescription remain an active topic of debate. We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates. The final prescriptive model shows a reduction in PPI rates of 26% and 16% compared with the current standard of care in our internal U.S. population and external Greek validation cohort, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first unified, personalized prescription strategy for THV selection in TAVR.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training objectives. However, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is hindered by substantial computational and memory overhead, primarily stemming from higher-order automatic differentiation, intensive tensor operations, and reliance on full-precision arithmetic. To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation. We further design PINTA, a precision-scalable hardware accelerator, to fully exploit the performance of the framework. Experiments on the 2-D Poisson, 20-D Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB), and 100-D Heat equations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision, uncompressed baselines while delivering 5.5x to 83.5x speedups and 159.6x to 2324.1x energy savings. This work enables real-time PDE solving on edge devices and paves the way for energy-efficient scientific computing at scale.

Abstract: Contrastive learning methods enforce label distance relationships in feature space to improve representation capability for regression models. However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

Abstract: The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems.

Abstract: Self supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn to understand the underlying structure of data without explicit supervision from labeled samples. The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved physics-driven neural network (IPDNN) framework for solving electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs). A new Gaussian-localized oscillation-suppressing window (GLOW) activation function is introduced to stabilize convergence and enable a lightweight yet accurate network architecture. A dynamic scatter subregion identification strategy is further developed to adaptively refine the computational domain, preventing missed detections and reducing computational cost. Moreover, transfer learning is incorporated to extend the solver's applicability to practical scenarios, integrating the physical interpretability of iterative algorithms with the real-time inference capability of neural networks. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solver achieves superior reconstruction accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for ``learning to branch'' in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.

Abstract: The persistent volatility of construction material prices poses significant risks to cost estimation, budgeting, and project delivery, underscoring the urgent need for granular and scalable forecasting methods. This study develops a forecasting framework that leverages the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat as the target data structure, enabling predictions at the six-digit section level and supporting detailed cost projections across a wide spectrum of building materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, the framework integrates explanatory variables such as raw material prices, commodity indexes, and macroeconomic indicators. Four time-series models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Chronos-Bolt, were evaluated under both baseline configurations (using CSI data only) and extended versions with explanatory variables. Results demonstrate that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all models. Among the tested approaches, the LSTM model consistently achieved the highest accuracy, with RMSE values as low as 1.390 and MAPE values of 0.957, representing improvements of up to 59\% over the traditional statistical time-series model, ARIMA. Validation across multiple CSI divisions confirmed the framework's scalability, while Division 06 (Wood, Plastics, and Composites) is presented in detail as a demonstration case. This research offers a robust methodology that enables owners and contractors to improve budgeting practices and achieve more reliable cost estimation at the Definitive level.

Abstract: Predicting molecule-protein interactions (MPIs) is a fundamental task in computational biology, with crucial applications in drug discovery and molecular function annotation. However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions. Beyond MPI prediction, our approach provides a new paradigm for leveraging diverse biological data sources to tackle problems traditionally constrained by single- or bi-modal learning, paving the way for future advances in computational biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Traffic accidents result in millions of injuries and fatalities globally, with a significant number occurring at intersections each year. Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains. The data and code are available in the github https://github.com/MJLee00/CFLight-Enhancing-Safety-with-Traffic-Signal-Control-through-Counterfactual-Learning.

Conclusion: 精心设计的HDC表示为高效的KG - LLM推理提供了实用基础，实现了准确性、效率和可解释性的良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability. These results indicate that carefully designed HDC representations provide a practical substrate for efficient KG-LLM reasoning, offering a favorable accuracy-efficiency-interpretability trade-off.

Abstract: Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.

Conclusion: 所提车辆边缘缓存方案有效可行，能解决传统方法存在的问题。

Abstract: Vehicle edge caching is a promising technology that can significantly reduce the latency for vehicle users (VUs) to access content by pre-caching user-interested content at edge nodes. It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage.

Abstract: Traffic prediction remains a key challenge in spatio-temporal data mining, despite progress in deep learning. Accurate forecasting is hindered by the complex influence of external factors such as traffic accidents and regulations, often overlooked by existing models due to limited data integration. To address these limitations, we present two enriched traffic datasets from Tokyo and California, incorporating traffic accident and regulation data. Leveraging these datasets, we propose ConFormer (Conditional Transformer), a novel framework that integrates graph propagation with guided normalization layer. This design dynamically adjusts spatial and temporal node relationships based on historical patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art STAEFormer in both predictive performance and efficiency, achieving lower computational costs and reduced parameter demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ConFormer consistently outperforms mainstream spatio-temporal baselines across multiple metrics, underscoring its potential to advance traffic prediction research.

Abstract: As medical large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, concerns around alignment robustness, and safety are escalating. Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored.
  We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments.
  Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.

Conclusion: 提出的CS公平正则化器能有效解决现有正则化器问题，在公平性和准确性间取得较好平衡。

Abstract: Group fairness in machine learning is often enforced by adding a regularizer that reduces the dependence between model predictions and sensitive attributes. However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers.

Abstract: Unequal representation of demographic groups in training data poses challenges to model generalisation across populations. Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions.

Abstract: We initiate the study of contextual dynamic pricing with a heterogeneous population of buyers, where a seller repeatedly posts prices (over $T$ rounds) that depend on the observable $d$-dimensional context and receives binary purchase feedback. Unlike prior work assuming homogeneous buyer types, in our setting the buyer's valuation type is drawn from an unknown distribution with finite support size $K_{\star}$. We develop a contextual pricing algorithm based on optimistic posterior sampling with regret $\widetilde{O}(K_{\star}\sqrt{dT})$, which we prove to be tight in $d$ and $T$ up to logarithmic terms. Finally, we refine our analysis for the non-contextual pricing case, proposing a variance-aware zooming algorithm that achieves the optimal dependence on $K_{\star}$.

Abstract: This study presents QuanvNeXt, an end-to-end fully quanvolutional model for EEG-based depression diagnosis. QuanvNeXt incorporates a novel Cross Residual block, which reduces feature homogeneity and strengthens cross-feature relationships while retaining parameter efficiency. We evaluated QuanvNeXt on two open-source datasets, where it achieved an average accuracy of 93.1% and an average AUC-ROC of 97.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as InceptionTime (91.7% accuracy, 95.9% AUC-ROC). An uncertainty analysis across Gaussian noise levels demonstrated well-calibrated predictions, with ECE scores remaining low (0.0436, Dataset 1) to moderate (0.1159, Dataset 2) even at the highest perturbation (ε = 0.1). Additionally, a post-hoc explainable AI analysis confirmed that QuanvNeXt effectively identifies and learns spectrotemporal patterns that distinguish between healthy controls and major depressive disorder. Overall, QuanvNeXt establishes an efficient and reliable approach for EEG-based depression diagnosis.

Result: 在概念验证框架内，模型能稳定训练，顺序和并行采样变体行为一致。

Conclusion: 语言模型部分时间结构可由潜在空间概率几何而非显式神经操作支持。

Abstract: We investigate a fully Latent AutoRegressive scheme based on a Gaussian Process (GP) integrated into a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). In this setting, sequential dynamics are transferred from the observation space to a continuous latent space, while linguistic generation remains parallel through a non-autoregressive decoder. We present a complete methodological formulation, including a causal GP prior, a structured amortized posterior, and a training protocol based on a regularized ELBO. Empirical evaluation, conducted within a deliberately constrained proof-of-concept (POC) framework, shows that the model can be trained stably and that the sequential and parallel sampling variants exhibit consistent behavior. Overall, the results suggest that part of the temporal structure in a language model can be supported by the probabilistic geometry of the latent space rather than by explicit neural operations.

Abstract: Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard test for sleep analysis, generates vast amounts of multimodal clinical data, presenting an opportunity to leverage self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) for pre-training foundation models to enhance sleep analysis. However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code.

Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) combined with Vehicular edge computing (VEC) provides an efficient edge task processing paradigm for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Focusing on highway scenarios, this paper proposes a Tripartite Cooperative Semantic Communication (TCSC) framework, which enables Vehicle Users (VUs) to perform semantic task offloading via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. Considering task latency and the number of semantic symbols, the framework constructs a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is transformed into two subproblems. First, we innovatively propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization task offloading optimization method based on parametric distribution noise (MAPPO-PDN) to solve the optimization problem of the number of semantic symbols; second, linear programming (LP) is used to solve offloading ratio. Simulations show that performance of this scheme is superior to that of other algorithms.

Result: 成员推理在大规模下效果有限，数据集推理在音频领域成功。

Conclusion: 数据集推理是大音频生成模型时代版权保护和数据集问责的有前景方向。

Abstract: Generative audio models, based on diffusion and autoregressive architectures, have advanced rapidly in both quality and expressiveness. This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies enables automated, real-time collection of manufacturing process data, unlocking new opportunities for data-driven product development. Current data-driven methods are generally applied within specific domains, such as design or manufacturing, with limited exploration of integrating design features and manufacturing process data. Since design decisions significantly affect manufacturing outcomes, such as error rates, energy consumption, and processing times, the lack of such integration restricts the potential for data-driven product design improvements. This paper presents a data-driven approach to mapping and analyzing the relationship between design features and manufacturing process data. A comprehensive system architecture is developed to ensure continuous data collection and integration. The linkage between design features and manufacturing process data serves as the basis for developing a machine learning model that enables automated design improvement suggestions. By integrating manufacturing process data with sustainability metrics, this approach opens new possibilities for sustainable product development.

Result: 在Minecraft环境超800个任务实验中，CrossAgent达到了最先进性能，优于固定动作基线。

Conclusion: CrossAgent能动态利用不同动作空间优势，在长程推理中具有更好的泛化性和效率。

Abstract: The paradigm of agentic AI is shifting from engineered complex workflows to post-training native models. However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance. By dynamically leveraging the strengths of diverse action spaces, our model significantly outperforms fixed-action baselines, exhibiting superior generalization and efficiency in long-horizon reasoning.

Result: 实验显示 MoLKV 在小规模评估中实现显著更低的验证损失。

Conclusion: MoLKV 能缓解 MoLE 局限性，在限定评估中表现更好。

Abstract: Recent research has developed several LLM architectures suitable for inference on end-user devices, such as the Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE)~\parencite{jie_mixture_2025}. A key feature of MoLE is that each token id is associated with a dedicated group of experts. For a given input, only the experts corresponding to the input token id will be activated. Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices. However, MoLE's context-independent expert selection mechanism, based solely on input ids, may limit model performance. To address this, we propose the \textbf{M}ixture \textbf{o}f \textbf{L}ookup \textbf{K}ey-\textbf{V}alue Experts (\textbf{MoLKV}) model. In MoLKV, each expert is structured as a key-value pair. For a given input, the input-derived query interacts with the cached key-value experts from the current sequence, generating a context-aware expert output. This context-aware mechanism alleviates the limitation of MoLE, and experimental results demonstrate that MoLKV achieves significantly lower validation loss in small-scale evaluations.

Abstract: Transformers generate valid and diverse chemical structures, but little is known about the mechanisms that enable these models to capture the rules of molecular representation. We present a mechanistic analysis of autoregressive transformers trained on drug-like small molecules to reveal the computational structure underlying their capabilities across multiple levels of abstraction. We identify computational patterns consistent with low-level syntactic parsing and more abstract chemical validity constraints. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we extract feature dictionaries associated with chemically relevant activation patterns. We validate our findings on downstream tasks and find that mechanistic insights can translate to predictive performance in various practical settings.

Abstract: Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting polymer solubility in various solvents is critical for applications ranging from recycling to pharmaceutical formulation. This work presents a deep learning framework that predicts polymer solubility, expressed as weight percent (wt%), directly from SMILES representations of both polymers and solvents. A dataset of 8,049 polymer solvent pairs at 25 deg C was constructed from calibrated molecular dynamics simulations (Zhou et al., 2023), and molecular descriptors and fingerprints were combined into a 2,394 feature representation per sample. A fully connected neural network with six hidden layers was trained using the Adam optimizer and evaluated using mean squared error loss, achieving strong agreement between predicted and actual solubility values. Generalizability was demonstrated using experimentally measured data from the Materials Genome Project, where the model maintained high accuracy on 25 unseen polymer solvent combinations. These findings highlight the viability of SMILES based machine learning models for scalable solubility prediction and high-throughput solvent screening, supporting applications in green chemistry, polymer processing, and materials design.

Result: DivMorph达到了SOTA性能，跨任务迁移样本效率提升3倍，单智能体部署模型大小减少17倍。

Conclusion: DivMorph能实现可扩展和高效的策略部署，支持向新任务有效迁移策略。

Abstract: Universal morphology control aims to learn a universal policy that generalizes across heterogeneous agent morphologies, with Transformer-based controllers emerging as a popular choice. However, such architectures incur substantial computational costs, resulting in high deployment overhead, and existing methods exhibit limited cross-task generalization, necessitating training from scratch for each new task. To this end, we propose \textbf{DivMorph}, a modular training paradigm that leverages knowledge diversion to learn decomposable controllers. DivMorph factorizes randomly initialized Transformer weights into factor units via SVD prior to training and employs dynamic soft gating to modulate these units based on task and morphology embeddings, separating them into shared \textit{learngenes} and morphology- and task-specific \textit{tailors}, thereby achieving knowledge disentanglement. By selectively activating relevant components, DivMorph enables scalable and efficient policy deployment while supporting effective policy transfer to novel tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 3$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency over direct finetuning for cross-task transfer and a 17$\times$ reduction in model size for single-agent deployment.

Abstract: Graph clustering plays a pivotal role in unsupervised learning methods like spectral clustering, yet traditional methods for graph clustering often perpetuate bias through unfair graph constructions that may underrepresent some groups. The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks.

Abstract: California's wildfire season keeps getting worse over the years, overwhelming the emergency response teams. These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.

Conclusion: Conformal Bandits框架在多臂老虎机问题上有优势，尤其在小差距场景，结合隐马尔可夫模型可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce Conformal Bandits, a novel framework integrating Conformal Prediction (CP) into bandit problems, a classic paradigm for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.
  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: HPM - KD框架有效解决知识蒸馏现存问题，提升蒸馏效果和效率，以开源形式共享。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising technique for model compression but faces critical limitations: (1) sensitivity to hyperparameters requiring extensive manual tuning, (2) capacity gap when distilling from very large teachers to small students, (3) suboptimal coordination in multi-teacher scenarios, and (4) inefficient use of computational resources. We present \textbf{HPM-KD}, a framework that integrates six synergistic components: (i) Adaptive Configuration Manager via meta-learning that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning, (ii) Progressive Distillation Chain with automatically determined intermediate models, (iii) Attention-Weighted Multi-Teacher Ensemble that learns dynamic per-sample weights, (iv) Meta-Learned Temperature Scheduler that adapts temperature throughout training, (v) Parallel Processing Pipeline with intelligent load balancing, and (vi) Shared Optimization Memory for cross-experiment reuse. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tabular datasets demonstrate that HPM-KD: achieves 10x-15x compression while maintaining 85% accuracy retention, eliminates the need for manual tuning, and reduces training time by 30-40% via parallelization. Ablation studies confirm independent contribution of each component (0.10-0.98 pp). HPM-KD is available as part of the open-source DeepBridge library.

Result: 所有PLMs在分类任务中准确率高，但在捕捉V基因使用等生物特征时有不同偏差；抗体特定模型自然关注互补决定区，通用蛋白质模型需明确针对互补决定区训练。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型架构与生物特征提取的关系，为计算抗体设计中未来PLM的发展提供有价值的指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding protein sequences. However, the extent to which different model architectures capture antibody-specific biological properties remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate how architectural choices in PLMs influence their ability to comprehend antibody sequence characteristics and functions. We evaluate three state-of-the-art PLMs-AntiBERTa, BioBERT, and ESM2--against a general-purpose language model (GPT-2) baseline on antibody target specificity prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that while all PLMs achieve high classification accuracy, they exhibit distinct biases in capturing biological features such as V gene usage, somatic hypermutation patterns, and isotype information. Through attention attribution analysis, we show that antibody-specific models like AntiBERTa naturally learn to focus on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while general protein models benefit significantly from explicit CDR-focused training strategies. These findings provide insights into the relationship between model architecture and biological feature extraction, offering valuable guidance for future PLM development in computational antibody design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出STACHE框架为离散马尔可夫游戏中智能体动作生成局部黑盒解释，在Gymnasium环境验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习智能体在稀疏奖励或安全关键环境中表现难以预料，需要可靠调试和验证工具。

Method: 提出STACHE框架生成复合解释，包含鲁棒区域和最小反事实情况，利用因子化状态空间结构引入基于搜索的精确算法。

Result: 在Gymnasium环境上的实验表明，框架能解释策略动作，捕捉训练中策略逻辑的演变。

Conclusion: 框架可对智能体敏感性和决策边界提供可行见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents often behave unexpectedly in sparse-reward or safety-critical environments, creating a strong need for reliable debugging and verification tools. In this paper, we propose STACHE, a comprehensive framework for generating local, black-box explanations for an agent's specific action within discrete Markov games. Our method produces a Composite Explanation consisting of two complementary components: (1) a Robustness Region, the connected neighborhood of states where the agent's action remains invariant, and (2) Minimal Counterfactuals, the smallest state perturbations required to alter that decision. By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models. Empirical validation on Gymnasium environments demonstrates that our framework not only explains policy actions, but also effectively captures the evolution of policy logic during training - from erratic, unstable behavior to optimized, robust strategies - providing actionable insights into agent sensitivity and decision boundaries.

Motivation: 解决现有Boltzmann Generators使用连续归一化流（CNFs）进行似然计算成本高的问题，该问题限制了其应用。

Method: 提出Few - step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON)方法，引入混合训练目标以实现少步采样且似然足够准确。

Result: FALCON在分子Boltzmann采样上优于现有归一化流模型，速度比同等性能的CNF模型快两个数量级。

Conclusion: FALCON方法有效，能解决现有分子状态采样方法的问题。

Abstract: Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators tackle this problem by pairing a generative model, capable of exact likelihood computation, with importance sampling to obtain consistent samples under the target distribution. Current Boltzmann Generators primarily use continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) trained with flow matching for efficient training of powerful models. However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility. We show FALCON outperforms state-of-the-art normalizing flow models for molecular Boltzmann sampling and is two orders of magnitude faster than the equivalently performing CNF model.

Motivation: 传统基于梯度的规划性能落后于其他方法，存在训练与测试目标不一致的差距，需要改进。

Method: 提出训练时数据合成技术，利用现有世界模型改善基于梯度的规划。

Result: 在各种物体操作和导航任务中，测试时用时为10%预算的情况下，表现优于或匹配经典无梯度的交叉熵方法（CEM）。

Conclusion: 所提出的训练世界模型的改进方法能有效实现高效基于梯度的规划。

Abstract: World models paired with model predictive control (MPC) can be trained offline on large-scale datasets of expert trajectories and enable generalization to a wide range of planning tasks at inference time. Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models. At test time, our approach outperforms or matches the classical gradient-free cross-entropy method (CEM) across a variety of object manipulation and navigation tasks in 10% of the time budget.

TL;DR: 本文介绍AI Co - Artist系统，借助大语言模型支持GLSL着色器迭代优化，降低技术门槛，提升创作效果，且方法可推广到多领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GLSL等工具学习曲线陡峭，对无技术背景的新手和艺术家造成使用障碍，需要降低技术门槛的创作工具。

Method: 借鉴Picbreeder平台的用户引导进化原则，利用大语言模型GPT - 4，通过用户友好的可视化界面支持GLSL着色器迭代优化。

Result: 通过用户研究和定性反馈评估，表明AI Co - Artist显著降低着色器创作技术门槛，提升创作效果，支持用户制作专业视觉效果。

Conclusion: 该系统可降低技术门槛、提升创作效果，其方法能广泛应用于不同创意领域。

Abstract: Creative coding and real-time shader programming are at the forefront of interactive digital art, enabling artists, designers, and enthusiasts to produce mesmerizing, complex visual effects that respond to real-time stimuli such as sound or user interaction. However, despite the rich potential of tools like GLSL, the steep learning curve and requirement for programming fluency pose substantial barriers for newcomers and even experienced artists who may not have a technical background. In this paper, we present AI Co-Artist, a novel interactive system that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to support the iterative evolution and refinement of GLSL shaders through a user-friendly, visually-driven interface. Drawing inspiration from the user-guided evolutionary principles pioneered by the Picbreeder platform, our system empowers users to evolve shader art using intuitive interactions, without needing to write or understand code. AI Co-Artist serves as both a creative companion and a technical assistant, allowing users to explore a vast generative design space of real-time visual art. Through comprehensive evaluations, including structured user studies and qualitative feedback, we demonstrate that AI Co-Artist significantly reduces the technical threshold for shader creation, enhances creative outcomes, and supports a wide range of users in producing professional-quality visual effects. Furthermore, we argue that this paradigm is broadly generalizable. By leveraging the dual strengths of LLMs-semantic understanding and program synthesis, our method can be applied to diverse creative domains, including website layout generation, architectural visualizations, product prototyping, and infographics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典神经网络难以捕捉无限维函数空间的复杂算子动态，标准神经算子缺乏时空输入信息混合或注意力机制，因此提出新方法。

Method: 将Koopman算子理论的谱线性化与卷积神经网络和非线性激活的深度特征学习相结合，近似Banach空间之间的非线性算子。

Result: 在Navier - Stokes方程的数值实验中，BNO实现了非定常流预测的稳健零样本超分辨率，始终优于传统基于Koopman的方法和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: BNO框架能有效预测非线性、时空动态，具有较高准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Classical neural networks are known for their ability to approximate mappings between finite-dimensional spaces, but they fall short in capturing complex operator dynamics across infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators, in contrast, have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning for learning such mappings. However, standard neural operators typically lack mechanisms for mixing or attending to input information across space and time. In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In particular, BNO achieves robust zero-shot super-resolution in unsteady flow prediction and consistently outperforms conventional Koopman-based methods and deep learning models.

Conclusion: 通过技术扩展和MAGPIE的应用，能有效提升线性遗传编程解释器的并行SIMD代码性能。

Abstract: We extend recent 256 SSE vector work to 512 AVX giving a four fold speedup. We use MAGPIE (Machine Automated General Performance Improvement via Evolution of software) to speedup a C++ linear genetic programming interpreter. Local search is provided with three alternative hand optimised codes, revision history and the Intel 512 bit AVX512VL documentation as C++ XML. Magpie is applied to the new Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel interpreter for Peter Nordin's linear genetic programming GPengine. Linux mprotect sandboxes whilst performance is given by perf instruction count. In both cases, in a matter of hours local search reliably sped up 114 or 310 lines of manually written parallel SIMD code for the Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) by 2 percent.

Method: 提出群体智能算法和引导提示协同进化框架及提示模板评估方法。

Result: 在NP问题上表现优于现有自动化设计方法，不同大语言模型生成提示进化轨迹不同，该方法减少对强大模型依赖，成本更低。

Conclusion: 协同进化对实现最优性能至关重要，为群体智能优化算法建立新范式，提示进化不可或缺。

Abstract: The field of automated algorithm design has been advanced by frameworks such as EoH, FunSearch, and Reevo. Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM. To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches. Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments. Ablation studies and in-depth analysis of the evolved prompts confirm that collaborative evolution is essential for achieving optimal performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, underscoring the indispensable role of prompt evolution.

Abstract: We present a novel predict-then-optimize framework for maritime search operations that integrates trajectory forecasting with UAV deployment optimization-an end-to-end approach not addressed in prior work. A large language model predicts the drifter's trajectory, and spatial uncertainty is modeled using Gaussian-based particle sampling. Unlike traditional static deployment methods, we dynamically adapt UAV detection radii based on distance and optimize their placement using meta-heuristic algorithms. Experiments on real-world data from the Korean coastline demonstrate that our method, particularly the repair mechanism designed for this problem, significantly outperforms the random search baselines. This work introduces a practical and robust integration of trajectory prediction and spatial optimization for intelligent maritime rescue.

Conclusion: GENESIS能同时优化三个子问题，性能优于现有的两种遗传算法和一种贪心算法。

Abstract: The reliance of organisations on computer networks is enabled by network programmability, which is typically achieved through Service Function Chaining. These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios. Moreover, GENESIS is the fastest among all Genetic Algorithms, averaging 15.84 minutes, compared to an average of 38.62 minutes for the second-best Genetic Algorithm.

Motivation: 软件开发加速使软件漏洞增多，自动化CVD过程必要，研究LLMs在CVD任务中的性能并提升其有效性。

Method: 探索多种微调与提示工程设置，提出双微调方法，测试测试时微调方法，利用Llama - 3.1 8B和相关数据集。

Result: 微调对解决任务重要，双调优性能好，Llama模型有潜力，提示无效，检索增强生成（RAG）作为示例选择技术表现较好。

Conclusion: 部分研究问题得到解答，还有很多待解决，有很多未来工作方向。

Abstract: The significant increase in software production, driven by the acceleration of development cycles over the past two decades, has led to a steady rise in software vulnerabilities, as shown by statistics published yearly by the CVE program. The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.

Method: 开发无代码进化优化平台ARTEMIS，通过语义感知遗传算子联合优化代理配置，依据基准脚本和自然语言目标自动发现可配置组件等。

Result: 在四个代表性代理系统评估中，分别实现接受率提升、性能增益、减少评估所需令牌数、提高准确率等。

Conclusion: ARTEMIS能有效优化代理配置，可用于基于商业和本地模型的代理优化。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating complex workflows, from software development to customer support. However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement. Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies.
  We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators. Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.
  We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation. We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能GPU内核优化是关键且费力的任务，使用Triton实现专家级性能需深入理解GPU架构和底层性能权衡。

Method: TritonForge集成内核分析、运行时分析和迭代代码转换，结合分析结果的数据驱动反馈，利用大语言模型辅助代码推理和转换。

Result: 在不同内核类型和GPU架构上，相比基线实现性能提升达5倍，平均成功率1.76倍。

Conclusion: 为未来自动GPU性能优化研究奠定基础。

Abstract: High-performance GPU kernel optimization remains a critical yet labor-intensive task in modern machine learning workloads. Although Triton, a domain-specific language for GPU programming, enables developers to write efficient kernels with concise code, achieving expert-level performance still requires deep understanding of GPU architectures and low-level performance trade-offs. We present TritonForge, a profiling-guided framework for automated Triton kernel optimization. TritonForge integrates kernel analysis, runtime profiling, and iterative code transformation to streamline the optimization process. By incorporating data-driven feedback from profiling results, the system identifies performance bottlenecks, proposes targeted code modifications, and evaluates their impact automatically. While our prototype leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist in code reasoning and transformation, the framework remains modular and model-agnostic. Across diverse kernel types and GPU architectures, TritonForge achieves up to 5x performance improvement over baseline implementations and on average 1.76x of the cases are successful, providing a foundation for future research in automated GPU performance optimization.

Motivation: 手动评估漏洞优先级变更繁琐且依赖主观判断，易导致错误变更，阻碍及时修复，且缺乏相关研究。

Method: 将漏洞生命周期分为报告和修复两阶段，为各阶段构建漏洞优先级变更预测模型。

Result: 所提特征和策略有效提升预测模型性能，报告阶段F1分数达0.798，修复阶段F1加权和F1宏分别为0.712和0.613；不同项目模型性能有差异但整体不错，不同优先级预测性能保持较高且相对稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段预测方法可行且有效，能为漏洞优先级变更预测提供参考。

Abstract: Bug fixing is a critical activity in the software development process. In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the cross-project applicability of our prediction models and their performance at different priority levels. The findings indicate large variations in model performance across different projects, although the overall scores remain decent. Meanwhile, the predictive performance across various priority levels remained relatively consistently high.

TL;DR: 研究在受限使用小语言模型（SLMs）时，四个领先的代理问题解决框架的性能、能源效率和资源消耗，发现当前框架与SLMs配合效率低，需新架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中基于自主代理依赖专有模型，限制本地部署，对SLMs在复杂代理框架中自动解决问题的有效性和效率了解不足，因此研究其在资源受限环境下的可行性及权衡。

Method: 在SWE - bench Verified Mini基准上，使用两个SLMs（Gemma - 3 4B, Qwen - 3 1.7B）对四个领先的代理框架（SWE - Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover）进行受控评估，在固定硬件上，每种配置运行150次并测量能源、时长、令牌使用和内存。

Result: 框架架构是能源消耗的主要驱动因素，能源消耗最多的AutoCodeRover（Gemma）比最少的OpenHands（Gemma）多9.4倍，但能源大多被浪费，任务解决率接近零，SLMs有限的推理能力是成功的瓶颈，框架设计是效率的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 当前为强大LLMs设计的代理框架与SLMs配合时无法高效运行，框架架构是能源消耗主因但因SLMs推理有限而浪费，可行的低能耗解决方案需从被动编排转向主动管理SLMs弱点的架构。

Abstract: Context. LLM-based autonomous agents in software engineering rely on large, proprietary models, limiting local deployment. This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.
  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.
  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.
  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.
  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning.

Abstract: Workflow mining discovers hierarchical process trees from event logs, but it remains unclear why such models satisfy or violate logical properties, or how individual elements contribute to overall behavior. We propose to translate mined workflows into logical specifications and analyze properties such as satisfiability, liveness, and safety with automated theorem provers. On this basis, we adapt Shapley values from cooperative game theory to attribute outcomes to workflow elements and quantify their contributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that this combination identifies critical nodes, reveals redundancies, and exposes harmful structures. This outlines a novel direction for explainable workflow analysis with direct relevance to software engineering practice, supporting compliance checks, process optimization, redundancy reduction, and the design of next-generation process mining tools.

Abstract: System engineering has been shifting from document-centric to model-based approaches, where assets are becoming more and more digital. Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型资源需求大、冷启动问题严重，现有跨域方法泛化能力差，难以捕捉潜在语义等价。

Result: 在少样本和零样本跨域基准测试中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LogICL能弥合语义差距，捕捉潜在语义等价，可快速部署。

Abstract: Effective log anomaly detection is critical to sustaining reliability in large-scale IT infrastructures. Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.

Motivation: 目前大语言模型在代码生成上表现出色，但链式思维（CoT）提示起作用的机制尚不明确，因此进行系统性研究。

Method: 通过实证和信息论进行研究，在多个 Python 基准、多语言基准上对五种范式进行评估，使用六种不同参数规模的模型，以条件互信息 $I(Y;C|X)$ 为视角。

Result: 外部引导的 CoT 始终优于直接生成，结构化方法平均提高 Pass@1 5 - 12%且使用更少的 token；CoT 效益依赖于语言类型系统和模型容量；推理质量很关键，高质量结构化 CoT 准确性更高，零样本 CoT 甚至可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于模型容量、语言特征和任务复杂度选择 CoT 策略提供实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on code generation, but the mechanisms by which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps remain unclear. We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.

Conclusion: 详细讨论了为领域专家提供的帮助。

Abstract: The recent convergence of pervasive computing and machine learning has given rise to numerous services, impacting almost all areas of economic and social activity. However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts.

Abstract: Revisiting the continuous-time Mean-Variance (MV) Portfolio Optimization problem, we model the market dynamics with a jump-diffusion process and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to facilitate informed exploration within the control space. We recognize the time-inconsistency of the MV problem and adopt the time-inconsistent control (TIC) approach to analytically solve for an exploratory equilibrium investment policy, which is a Gaussian distribution centered on the equilibrium control of the classical MV problem. Our approach accounts for time-inconsistent preferences and actions, and our equilibrium policy is the best option an investor can take at any given time during the investment period. Moreover, we leverage the martingale properties of the equilibrium policy, design a RL model, and propose an Actor-Critic RL algorithm. All of our RL model parameters converge to the corresponding true values in a simulation study. Our numerical study on 24 years of real market data shows that the proposed RL model is profitable in 13 out of 14 tests, demonstrating its practical applicability in real world investment.

Conclusion: SSQP方法是首个无需投影算子达原 - 对偶渐近最小最大最优的全在线方法，能有效解决问题并提供实际应用中的有效在线推断。

Abstract: We study online statistical inference for the solutions of stochastic optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of Hájek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications.

Method: 引入WTNN框架，结合Weibull分布形状结构融入定性先验知识。

Result: 该方法能在代理和右删失数据上可靠训练，产生稳健且可解释的生存预测。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进现有方法。

Abstract: The Weibull distribution is a commonly adopted choice for modeling the survival of systems subject to maintenance over time. When only proxy indicators and censored observations are available, it becomes necessary to express the distribution's parameters as functions of time-dependent covariates. Deep neural networks provide the flexibility needed to learn complex relationships between these covariates and operational lifetime, thereby extending the capabilities of traditional regression-based models. Motivated by the analysis of a fleet of military vehicles operating in highly variable and demanding environments, as well as by the limitations observed in existing methodologies, this paper introduces WTNN, a new neural network-based modeling framework specifically designed for Weibull survival studies. The proposed architecture is specifically designed to incorporate qualitative prior knowledge regarding the most influential covariates, in a manner consistent with the shape and structure of the Weibull distribution. Through numerical experiments, we show that this approach can be reliably trained on proxy and right-censored data, and is capable of producing robust and interpretable survival predictions that can improve existing approaches.

Result: 证明加权DRE在非渐近框架下即使重度污染也能实现稀疏一致性。

Conclusion: 首次对重度污染下的强鲁棒性进行了非渐近分析。

Abstract: We examine the non-asymptotic properties of robust density ratio estimation (DRE) in contaminated settings. Weighted DRE is the most promising among existing methods, exhibiting doubly strong robustness from an asymptotic perspective. This study demonstrates that Weighted DRE achieves sparse consistency even under heavy contamination within a non-asymptotic framework. This method addresses two significant challenges in density ratio estimation and robust estimation. For density ratio estimation, we provide the non-asymptotic properties of estimating unbounded density ratios under the assumption that the weighted density ratio function is bounded. For robust estimation, we introduce a non-asymptotic framework for doubly strong robustness under heavy contamination, assuming that at least one of the following conditions holds: (i) contamination ratios are small, and (ii) outliers have small weighted values. This work provides the first non-asymptotic analysis of strong robustness under heavy contamination.

Conclusion: 建立了理解含PE的上下文学习中正常和对抗泛化的新框架。

Abstract: Positional encoding (PE) is a core architectural component of Transformers, yet its impact on the Transformer's generalization and robustness remains unclear. In this work, we provide the first generalization analysis for a single-layer Transformer under in-context regression that explicitly accounts for a completely trainable PE module. Our result shows that PE systematically enlarges the generalization gap. Extending to the adversarial setting, we derive the adversarial Rademacher generalization bound. We find that the gap between models with and without PE is magnified under attack, demonstrating that PE amplifies the vulnerability of models. Our bounds are empirically validated by a simulation study. Together, this work establishes a new framework for understanding the clean and adversarial generalization in ICL with PE.

Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) map is a geometry-driven transformation between high-dimensional probability distributions which underpins a wide range of tasks in statistics, applied probability, and machine learning. However, existing statistical theory for OT map estimation is quite restricted, hinging on Brenier's theorem (quadratic cost, absolutely continuous source) to guarantee existence and uniqueness of a deterministic OT map, on which various additional regularity assumptions are imposed to obtain quantitative error bounds. In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails. These contributions constitute the first general-purpose theory for map estimation, compatible with a wide spectrum of real-world applications where optimal transport may be intrinsically stochastic.

Conclusion: 所提OT算法在表格分类任务中有效，能在降低计算成本的同时达到与Transformer相当的准确率，但需精心设计虚拟几何。

Abstract: This thesis examines self-attention training through the lens of Optimal Transport (OT) and develops an OT-based alternative for tabular classification. The study tracks intermediate projections of the self-attention layer during training and evaluates their evolution using discrete OT metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Monge gap, optimality, and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on classification tasks with two and three classes, as well as on a biomedical dataset.
  Results indicate that the final self-attention mapping often approximates the OT optimal coupling, yet the training trajectory remains inefficient. Pretraining the MLP section on synthetic data partially improves convergence but is sensitive to their initialization. To address these limitations, an OT-based algorithm is introduced: it generates class-specific dummy Gaussian distributions, computes an OT alignment with the data, and trains an MLP to generalize this mapping. The method achieves accuracy comparable to Transformers while reducing computational cost and scaling more efficiently under standardized inputs, though its performance depends on careful dummy-geometry design. All experiments and implementations are conducted in R.

Conclusion: 基于束搜索的方法在大语言模型不确定性量化上比多项抽样更有效。

Abstract: Consistency-based methods have emerged as an effective approach to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models. These methods typically rely on several generations obtained via multinomial sampling, measuring their agreement level. However, in short-form QA, multinomial sampling is prone to producing duplicates due to peaked distributions, and its stochasticity introduces considerable variance in uncertainty estimates across runs. We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the beam set probability mass under which beam search achieves a smaller error than multinomial sampling. We empirically evaluate our approach on six QA datasets and find that its consistent improvements over multinomial sampling lead to state-of-the-art UQ performance.

Abstract: In-context learning with attention enables large neural networks to make context-specific predictions by selectively focusing on relevant examples. Here, we adapt this idea to supervised learning procedures such as lasso regression and gradient boosting, for tabular data. Our goals are to (1) flexibly fit personalized models for each prediction point and (2) retain model simplicity and interpretability.
  Our method fits a local model for each test observation by weighting the training data according to attention, a supervised similarity measure that emphasizes features and interactions that are predictive of the outcome. Attention weighting allows the method to adapt to heterogeneous data in a data-driven way, without requiring cluster or similarity pre-specification. Further, our approach is uniquely interpretable: for each test observation, we identify which features are most predictive and which training observations are most relevant. We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient surrogate modeling is essential for modern computational science, and there are a staggering number of emulation methods to choose from. With new methods being developed all the time, comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of different methods remains a challenge due to inconsistent benchmarking practices and (sometimes) limited reproducibility and transparency. In this work, we present a large-scale, fully reproducible comparison of $29$ distinct emulators across $60$ canonical test functions and $40$ real emulation datasets. To facilitate rigorous, apples-to-apples comparisons, we introduce the R package \texttt{duqling}, which streamlines reproducible simulation studies using a consistent, simple syntax, and automatic internal scaling of inputs. This framework allows researchers to compare emulators in a unified environment and makes it possible to replicate or extend previous studies with minimal effort, even across different publications. Our results provide detailed empirical insight into the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art emulators and offer guidance for both method developers and practitioners selecting a surrogate for new data. We discuss best practices for emulator comparison and highlight how \texttt{duqling} can accelerate research in emulator design and application.

Abstract: We propose geodesic-based optimization methods on dually flat spaces, where the geometric structure of the parameter manifold is closely related to the form of the objective function. A primary application is maximum likelihood estimation in statistical models, especially exponential families, whose model manifolds are dually flat. We show that an m-geodesic update, which directly optimizes the log-likelihood, can theoretically reach the maximum likelihood estimator in a single step. In contrast, an e-geodesic update has a practical advantage in cases where the parameter space is geodesically complete, allowing optimization without explicitly handling parameter constraints. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and validate their effectiveness through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 随机优化工程系统因高保真模拟计算成本高常不可行，现有双保真方法未同时利用设计空间曲率和随机空间相关性。

Method: 提出BISTRO方法，先利用低保真目标函数曲率信息，再切换到方差缩减随机梯度下降程序。

Result: 在基准问题和20维航天飞机再入案例中，BISTRO比自适应采样和方差缩减程序收敛更快，削减计算成本达29倍。

Conclusion: BISTRO方法在不确定下的无约束优化中有效，有收敛保证且能显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Stochastic optimization of engineering systems is often infeasible due to repeated evaluations of a computationally expensive, high-fidelity simulation. Bi-fidelity methods mitigate this challenge by leveraging a cheaper, approximate model to accelerate convergence. Most existing bi-fidelity approaches, however, exploit either design-space curvature or random-space correlation, not both. We present BISTRO - a BI-fidelity Stochastic Trust-Region Optimizer for unconstrained optimization under uncertainty through a stochastic approximation procedure. This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable. The method then switches to a variance-reduced stochastic gradient descent procedure. We provide convergence guarantees in expectation under certain regularity assumptions and ensure the best-case $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. On benchmark problems and a 20-dimensional space shuttle reentry case, BISTRO converges faster than adaptive sampling and variance reduction procedures and cuts computational expense by up to 29x.

Motivation: 优化大语言模型训练中权重矩阵函数的问题，摆脱Muon更新依赖的谱范数局限。

Method: 利用Ky Fan k - 范数的对偶引入Fanions算法，结合Frobenius范数和$l_\infty$范数构建F - Fanions和S - Fanions家族。

Result: F - Muon和S - Muon性能与Muon相当，在合成线性最小二乘问题上优于原始Muon。

Conclusion: 所提出的F - Fanions和S - Fanions家族算法具有良好性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of various matrix norms for optimizing functions of weight matrices, a crucial problem in training large language models. Moving beyond the spectral norm underlying the Muon update, we leverage duals of the Ky Fan $k$-norms to introduce a family of Muon-like algorithms we name Fanions, which are closely related to Dion. By working with duals of convex combinations of the Ky Fan $k$-norms with either the Frobenius norm or the $l_\infty$ norm, we construct the families of F-Fanions and S-Fanions, respectively. Their most prominent members are F-Muon and S-Muon. We complement our theoretical analysis with an extensive empirical study of these algorithms across a wide range of tasks and settings, demonstrating that F-Muon and S-Muon consistently match Muon's performance, while outperforming vanilla Muon on a synthetic linear least squares problem.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates non-parametric knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), typically from unstructured texts and structured graphs. While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抽象压缩器在检索增强生成中，易因检索文档含无关或错误信息而遗漏关键信息。

Method: 对检索文档进行更细粒度分类，提出ACoRN方法，包括对训练数据集进行离线数据增强，以及微调生成围绕支持正确答案关键信息的摘要。

Result: 使用ACoRN训练的T5 - large作为压缩器，能提高EM和F1分数并保留答案字符串。

Conclusion: ACoRN在含大量降低准确率文档的数据集上表现出色，在现实场景很有用。

Abstract: Abstractive compression utilizes smaller langauge models to condense query-relevant context, reducing computational costs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成反思性文本能力增强，引发对语言形式与心理表征关系的疑问，因此评估其按MBT参数重现心理化语言结构的程度。

Method: 让人类参与者与标准模式配置的大语言模型进行50次对话，由5名接受过MBT培训的精神科医生在盲态下沿MBT四个轴评估模型产生的心理化轮廓，并使用ICC(3,1)估计评估者间一致性。

Result: 生成轮廓结构连贯性高，评估者间有实质性到高度的一致性；模型在隐式 - 显式和自我 - 他人维度更稳定，在整合内部状态和外部背景方面有局限，轮廓连贯且临床可解释，但情感中立。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但从结果可推测大语言模型在一定程度上能重现心理化语言结构，但存在改进空间。

Abstract: Background: Mentalization integrates cognitive, affective, and intersubjective components. Large Language Models (LLMs) display an increasing ability to generate reflective texts, raising questions regarding the relationship between linguistic form and mental representation. This study assesses the extent to which a single LLM can reproduce the linguistic structure of mentalization according to the parameters of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT).
  Methods: Fifty dialogues were generated between human participants and an LLM configured in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).
  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters. The model proved more stable in the Implicit-Explicit and Self-Other dimensions, while presenting limitations in the integration of internal states and external contexts. The profiles were coherent and clinically interpretable yet characterized by affective neutrality.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的临床决策支持系统在处理非结构化牙科记录、不完整影像描述和复杂安全约束时存在困难，需更有效的方法进行儿科牙科临床记录解读和安全抗生素处方。

Method: 提出KG - LLM，集成儿科牙科知识图谱、检索增强生成（RAG）和多阶段安全验证管道，先通过临床NER/RE模块提取信息，再从知识图谱检索相关内容供大语言模型预测，通过双层验证机制确保安全。

Conclusion: 知识图谱、RAG和安全模块对临床可靠性和可解释性有重要贡献。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of pediatric dental clinical records and safe antibiotic prescribing remain persistent challenges in dental informatics. Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system. Ablation analyses indicate that the knowledge graph, RAG, and safety modules each contribute substantially to clinical reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: 从机制可解释性角度分析幻觉，为设计更可靠的GraphRAG系统提供信息。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge from linearized subgraphs retrieved from knowledge graphs. However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1. By grounding hallucination analysis in mechanistic interpretability, our work offers insights into how structural limitations in LLMs contribute to hallucinations, informing the design of more reliable GraphRAG systems in the future.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to absorb and reflect personality traits and attitudes specified by users. In our study, we investigated this potential using robust psychometric measures. We adapted the most studied test in psychological literature, namely Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and examined LLMs' behavior to identify traits. To asses the sensitivity of LLMs' prompts and psychological biases we created personality-oriented prompts, crafting a detailed set of personas that vary in trait intensity. This enables us to measure how well LLMs follow these roles. Our study introduces MindShift, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' psychological adaptability. The results highlight a consistent improvement in LLMs' role perception, attributed to advancements in training datasets and alignment techniques. Additionally, we observe significant differences in responses to psychometric assessments across different model types and families, suggesting variability in their ability to emulate human-like personality traits. MindShift prompts and code for LLM evaluation will be publicly available.

Motivation: 大语言模型单轮生成表现好，但多轮交互中基于令牌的范式存在漂移、推理模式不一致和提示增长问题。

Method: 提出CORE，结合通用认知算子库和持久的局部概念，每次模型调用仅接收概念状态、用户最新指令和所选算子。

Result: 初步原型模拟显示累积提示令牌减少约42%。

Conclusion: CORE提供了与模型无关的机制，将概念推理与语言生成分离，为更稳定的多轮系统指明可扩展方向。

Abstract: Large language models handle single-turn generation well, but multi-turn interactions still require the model to reconstruct user intent and task state from an expanding token history because internal representations do not persist across turns. This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate. CORE offers a model-agnostic mechanism that separates conceptual reasoning from language generation, suggesting a scalable direction for more stable multi-turn systems.

Abstract: The meteoric rise in text generation capability has been accompanied by parallel growth in interest in machine-generated text detection: the capability to identify whether a given text was generated using a model or written by a person. While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems. We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes.

Method: Luxical结合稀疏TF - IDF特征、小ReLU网络和知识蒸馏训练方案，以较低成本近似大型Transformer嵌入模型。

Result: 在两个不同应用中，相比不同规模的神经基线模型速度提升3倍到100倍，在数据整理任务中与FastText推理速度相当，质量与神经基线匹配。

Conclusion: Luxical在大规模文本组织中具有良好的计算/质量权衡。

Abstract: Frontier language model quality increasingly hinges on our ability to organize web-scale text corpora for training. Today's dominant tools trade off speed and flexibility: lexical classifiers (e.g., FastText) are fast but limited to producing classification output scores, while the vector-valued outputs of transformer text embedding models flexibly support numerous workflows (e.g., clustering, classification, and retrieval) but are computationally expensive to produce. We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed "lexical-dense" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification. In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task. On these evaluations, the tested Luxical model illustrates favorable compute/quality trade-offs for large-scale text organization, matching the quality of neural baselines. Luxical is available as open-source software at https://github.com/datologyai/luxical.

Result: 在多项任务中，该方法在连续和非连续设置下都能以更高的端到端准确率和更低的推理成本胜过现有方法，在连续设置下减少训练成本

Conclusion: CONCUR是有效的持续路由框架，对路由问题有良好解决效果

Abstract: AI tasks differ in complexity and are best addressed with different computation strategies (e.g., combinations of models and decoding methods). Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.

Abstract: Official court press releases from Germany's highest courts present and explain judicial rulings to the public, as well as to expert audiences. Prior NLP efforts emphasize technical headnotes, ignoring citizen-oriented communication needs. We introduce CourtPressGER, a 6.4k dataset of triples: rulings, human-drafted press releases, and synthetic prompts for LLMs to generate comparable releases. This benchmark trains and evaluates LLMs in generating accurate, readable summaries from long judicial texts. We benchmark small and large LLMs using reference-based metrics, factual-consistency checks, LLM-as-judge, and expert ranking. Large LLMs produce high-quality drafts with minimal hierarchical performance loss; smaller models require hierarchical setups for long judgments. Initial benchmarks show varying model performance, with human-drafted releases ranking highest.

First, context-aware prompts are designed to guide LLMs in extracting implicit hate patterns. Next, task-specific features are integrated during supervised fine-tuning to enhance domain adaptation. Finally, merging fine-tuned LLMs improves robustness against out-of-distribution cases. Evaluations on the STATE-ToxiCN benchmark validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods in detecting fine-grained hate speech.

In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. "Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.

TL;DR: 研究重新审查LLM可靠性，发现虽个体判断有差异，但LLM可作为主观NLP任务评估的可扩展代理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论自动检测困难，传统标注一致性指标存在问题，LLM虽有可扩展性但不能完全替代人类判断

Method: 使用跨评估者可靠性（xRR）主观感知框架重新审查LLM可靠性，并测试LLM生成的标注是否能保留人类评估得出的模型性能相对排序

Result: LLM在个体层面与人类不同，但可重现类似的排名和分类模式

Conclusion: LLM不能替代人类标注者，但可作为主观NLP任务评估的可扩展代理

Abstract: Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $κ$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.

Conclusion: 为语言资源社区提供了新的细粒度对话资源，扩展了社交和心理健康对话分析的现有数据集。

Abstract: This paper presents OnCoCo 1.0, a new public dataset for fine-grained message classification in online counseling. It is based on a new, integrative system of categories, designed to improve the automated analysis of psychosocial online counseling conversations. Existing category systems, predominantly based on Motivational Interviewing (MI), are limited by their narrow focus and dependence on datasets derived mainly from face-to-face counseling. This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners. Thus, our work contributes a new type of fine-grained conversational resource to the language resources community, extending existing datasets for social and mental-health dialogue analysis.

Abstract: Continual learning in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) faces the dual challenges of catastrophic forgetting and the high computational cost of retraining. This study establishes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient framework to address these challenges in dedicated NMT architectures. We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湍流具有多尺度相互作用，标准DDPMs在预测时会出现频谱崩溃问题，需改进方法以准确预测。

Method: 将噪声调度重新解释为频谱正则化器，引入幂律调度β(τ)∝τ^γ，提出Lazy Diffusion一步蒸馏方法。

Result: 解决了频谱崩溃问题，稳定了长时自回归，恢复了物理上合理的惯性范围标度。

Conclusion: 简单的高斯调度与幂律物理结构不兼容，物理感知的扩散过程可为多尺度动力系统提供准确、高效和完全概率性的替代方案。

Abstract: Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-λ}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $β(τ)\!\propto\!τ^γ$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that naïve Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.

Method: 引入去噪器层次结构，利用高阶得分函数优化；研究高斯核平滑的插件估计和高阶得分匹配的直接估计两种策略。

Result: 去噪器层次结构能提高去噪质量，极限去噪器可确定最优传输映射；给出了层次结构的组合结构特征。

Conclusion: 该去噪器层次结构为信号去噪和经验贝叶斯开辟了新视角。

Abstract: We revisit the signal denoising problem through the lens of optimal transport: the goal is to recover an unknown scalar signal distribution $X \sim P$ from noisy observations $Y = X + σZ$, with $Z$ being standard Gaussian independent of $X$ and $σ>0$ a known noise level. Let $Q$ denote the distribution of $Y$. We introduce a hierarchy of denoisers $T_0, T_1, \ldots, T_\infty : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that are agnostic to the signal distribution $P$, depending only on higher-order score functions of $Q$. Each denoiser $T_K$ is progressively refined using the $(2K-1)$-th order score function of $Q$ at noise resolution $σ^{2K}$, achieving better denoising quality measured by the Wasserstein metric $W(T_K \sharp Q, P)$. The limiting denoiser $T_\infty$ identifies the optimal transport map with $T_\infty \sharp Q = P$.
  We provide a complete characterization of the combinatorial structure underlying this hierarchy through Bell polynomial recursions, revealing how higher-order score functions encode the optimal transport map for signal denoising. We study two estimation strategies with convergence rates for higher-order scores from i.i.d. samples drawn from $Q$: (i) plug-in estimation via Gaussian kernel smoothing, and (ii) direct estimation via higher-order score matching. This hierarchy of agnostic denoisers opens new perspectives in signal denoising and empirical Bayes.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-stage workflow for computational materials discovery that achieves a 99% success rate in identifying compounds within 100 meV/atom of thermodynamic stability, with a threefold improvement over previous approaches. By combining the Matra-Genoa generative model, Orb-v2 universal machine learning interatomic potential, and ALIGNN graph neural network for energy prediction, we generated 119 million candidate structures and added 1.3 million DFT-validated compounds to the ALEXANDRIA database, including 74 thousand new stable materials. The expanded ALEXANDRIA database now contains 5.8 million structures with 175 thousand compounds on the convex hull. Predicted structural disorder rates (37-43%) match experimental databases, unlike other recent AI-generated datasets. Analysis reveals fundamental patterns in space group distributions, coordination environments, and phase stability networks, including sub-linear scaling of convex hull connectivity. We release the complete dataset, including sAlex25 with 14 million out-of-equilibrium structures containing forces and stresses for training universal force fields. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a GRACE model on this data improves benchmark accuracy. All data, models, and workflows are freely available under Creative Commons licenses.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative machine learning have opened new possibilities for the discovery and design of novel materials. However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules.

Result: MaxU SP - BP大大缓解了最后一包问题，略微扩展了网络容量区域。

Conclusion: MaxU方法能在不增加控制消息开销的情况下扩展BP路由性能。

Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is an established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, noted for its fully distributed operation and maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.

Conclusion: M3Net能显著提高网络性能指标预测的准确性。

Abstract: The rise of 5G/6G network technologies promises to enable applications like autonomous vehicles and virtual reality, resulting in a significant increase in connected devices and necessarily complicating network management. Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow

Method: 提出元学习框架，在任务执行期间进行局部类新赫布更新，并通过学习的切线传播优化可塑性参数。

Result: 得到的三因素学习规则仅用局部信息和延迟奖励实现长时间尺度的信用分配。

Conclusion: 为循环电路学习的生物机制提供新见解。

Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.

Conclusion: NeuroSketch是用于神经解码的强大工具。

Abstract: Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding.

Motivation: 解决在给定未知k - 局部哈密顿量H的动力学和指定目标哈密顿量H0时，判断H与H0是否相等或差异至少为ε，同时最小化总演化时间的问题。

Method: 提出一种只使用正向实时动力学的算法。

Result: 对于一般n - 量子比特、k - 局部、无迹哈密顿量，总演化时间为O(c^k/ε)，高概率成功；对于O(1) - 局部哈密顿量，总演化时间为Θ(1/ε)，达到Heisenberg极限缩放。

Conclusion: 该算法无需逆演化和控制操作，能对所有恒定局域性哈密顿量实现最优不容忍认证。

Abstract: We study the problem of certifying local Hamiltonians from real-time access to their dynamics. Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.

Method: 使用1992 - 2017年MDL的数据，研究Lone Pine命令和试验案件审判过程对MDL案件结果的影响。

Result: Lone Pine命令与MDL过程中解决的案件数量增加相关。

Conclusion: Lone Pine命令对MDL案件解决有积极影响。

Abstract: Case management by judges is increasingly determining the outcome of litigation, particularly in the multidistrict litigation (MDL) process. One concern is that the MDL process pressures defendants to settle, regardless of the merits, and provides insufficient information on the value of individual cases within the MDL. Critics of the MDL system have suggested two management orders as solutions to these problems. The first is Lone Pine orders, which require plaintiffs in an MDL to produce evidence of injury and causation. The second is bellwether trials, in which the court selects certain cases for trial to provide information on the value of claims and encourage settlement. We examine the impact of Lone Pine orders and bellwether trial processes on the outcomes of cases in multidistrict litigation (MDLs). Using data on MDLs from 1992 to 2017, we find that Lone Pine orders are associated with an increase in the number of cases resolved in the MDL process.

Motivation: 构建有效的腐败指数以衡量腐败情况。

Method: 结合审计违规字典与主成分分析构建自动化腐败指数，还使用监督学习方法对比。

Result: 指数验证有效，解释71 - 73%手工编码腐败计数的变化，与理论预测一致，监督学习排名相关性高。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到完整审计语料库，在透明度、成本和长期可复制性方面优于手动编码和大语言模型。

Abstract: Using Brazilian municipal audit reports, I construct an automated corruption index that combines a dictionary of audit irregularities with principal component analysis. The index validates strongly against independent human coders, explaining 71-73 \% of the variation in hand-coded corruption counts in samples where coders themselves exhibit high agreement, and the results are robust within these validation samples. The index behaves as theory predicts, correlating with municipal characteristics that prior research links to corruption. Supervised learning alternatives yield nearly identical municipal rankings ($R^{2}=0.98$), confirming that the dictionary approach captures the same underlying construct. The method scales to the full audit corpus and offers advantages over both manual coding and Large Language Models (LLMs) in transparency, cost, and long-run replicability.

TL;DR: 构建并测试了机构AI平台，证明大学可公平、透明且合规地提供先进AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业AI工具采用碎片化且高风险，存在访问不平等和合规问题，机构需可控制的AI提供方式。

Method: 构建三层的受管网关平台，包括前端、网关核心和提供商层。

Result: 六个月300用户的试点运行可靠，无隐私事故，采用率高，实现欧盟默认路由等。

Conclusion: AI是战略而非支持功能，建议设立AI Officer，以确保高校能运营多供应商AI平台。

Abstract: To counter fragmented, high-risk adoption of commercial AI tools, we built and ran an institutional AI platform in a six-month, 300-user pilot, showing that a university of applied sciences can offer advanced AI with fair access, transparent risks, controlled costs, and alignment with European law.
  Commercial AI subscriptions create unequal access and compliance risks through opaque processing and non-EU hosting, yet banning them is neither realistic nor useful. Institutions need a way to provide powerful AI in a sovereign, accountable form.
  Our solution is a governed gateway platform with three layers: a ChatGPT-style frontend linked to institutional identity that makes model choice explicit; a gateway core enforcing policy, controlling access and budgets, and routing traffic to EU infrastructure by default; and a provider layer wrapping commercial and open-source models in institutional model cards that consolidate vendor documentation into one governance interface.
  The pilot ran reliably with no privacy incidents and strong adoption, enabling EU-default routing, managed spending, and transparent model choices. Only the gateway pattern combines model diversity and rapid innovation with institutional control.
  The central insight: AI is not a support function but strategy, demanding dedicated leadership. Sustainable operation requires governance beyond traditional boundaries. We recommend establishing a formal AI Officer role combining technical literacy, governance authority, and educational responsibility. Without it, AI decisions stay ad-hoc and institutional exposure grows. With it, higher-education institutions can realistically operate their own multi-provider AI platform, provided they govern AI as seriously as they teach it.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨国际AI治理框架在解决性别问题和基于性别的伤害方面的情况。

Method: 对具有代表性的不同类别的AI治理工具（如欧盟AI法案、教科文组织建议、全球合作倡议等）进行分析。

Result: 发现AI治理框架存在新兴趋势，如将性别问题纳入人权框架、出现明确性别相关条款、强调包容和多样性，但也存在对性别处理不一致、缺乏对交叉性的关注和有效执行机制等问题。

Conclusion: 有效的AI治理必须具有交叉性、可执行性和包容性，性别敏感治理对构建公正的技术未来至关重要。

Abstract: This paper examines how international AI governance frameworks address gender issues and gender-based harms. The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms. However, this paper argues that effective AI governance must be intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive. This is key to moving beyond tokenism toward meaningful equity and preventing reinforcement of existing inequalities. The study contributes to ethical AI debates by highlighting the importance of gender-sensitive governance in building a just technological future.

Method: 采用四级迭代的ERLs方法，使用基于特定背景指标的动态树状问卷进行评估，并建立评分系统跟踪进展，通过两个案例研究来验证。

Result: ERL工具有效促使了具体的设计改变。

Conclusion: ERLs有助于实现结构化对话，推动从狭隘的技术解决方案主义向更加反思、以伦理为设计导向的思维转变。

Abstract: We present Ethics Readiness Levels (ERLs), a four-level, iterative method to track how ethical reflection is implemented in the design of AI systems. ERLs bridge high-level ethical principles and everyday engineering by turning ethical values into concrete prompts, checks, and controls within real use cases. The evaluation is conducted using a dynamic, tree-like questionnaire built from context-specific indicators, ensuring relevance to the technology and application domain. Beyond being a managerial tool, ERLs help facilitate a structured dialogue between ethics experts and technical teams, while our scoring system helps track progress over time. We demonstrate the methodology through two case studies: an AI facial sketch generator for law enforcement and a collaborative industrial robot. The ERL tool effectively catalyzes concrete design changes and promotes a shift from narrow technological solutionism to a more reflective, ethics-by-design mindset.

Conclusion: 该综述和开源工具能帮助科学家和工程师更好地处理含噪数据求导问题。

Abstract: Differentiation is a cornerstone of computing and data analysis in every discipline of science and engineering. Indeed, most fundamental physics laws are expressed as relationships between derivatives in space and time. However, derivatives are rarely directly measurable and must instead be computed, often from noisy, potentially corrupt data streams. There is a rich and broad literature of computational differentiation algorithms, but many impose extra constraints to work correctly, e.g. periodic boundary conditions, or are compromised in the presence of noise and corruption. It can therefore be challenging to select the method best-suited to any particular problem. Here, we review a broad range of numerical methods for calculating derivatives, present important contextual considerations and choice points, compare relative advantages, and provide basic theory for each algorithm in order to assist users with the mathematical underpinnings. This serves as a practical guide to help scientists and engineers match methods to application domains. We also provide an open-source Python package, PyNumDiff, which contains a broad suite of methods for differentiating noisy data.

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗系统确保AI部署长期安全有效提供实用模板和起点。

Abstract: Post-deployment monitoring of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in health care is essential to ensure their safety, quality, and sustained benefit-and to support governance decisions about which systems to update, modify, or decommission. Motivated by these needs, we developed a framework for monitoring deployed AI systems grounded in the mandate to take specific actions when they fail to behave as intended. This framework, which is now actively used at Stanford Health Care, is organized around three complementary principles: system integrity, performance, and impact. System integrity monitoring focuses on maximizing system uptime, detecting runtime errors, and identifying when changes to the surrounding IT ecosystem have unintended effects. Performance monitoring focuses on maintaining accurate system behavior in the face of changing health care practices (and thus input data) over time. Impact monitoring assesses whether a deployed system continues to have value in the form of benefit to clinicians and patients. Drawing on examples of deployed AI systems at our academic medical center, we provide practical guidance for creating monitoring plans based on these principles that specify which metrics to measure, when those metrics should be reviewed, who is responsible for acting when metrics change, and what concrete follow-up actions should be taken-for both traditional and generative AI. We also discuss challenges to implementing this framework, including the effort and cost of monitoring for health systems with limited resources and the difficulty of incorporating data-driven monitoring practices into complex organizations where conflicting priorities and definitions of success often coexist. This framework offers a practical template and starting point for health systems seeking to ensure that AI deployments remain safe and effective over time.

Motivation: AIGC发展引发虚假信息传播担忧，多数AIGC检测器会被对抗样本突破，且基于决策的黑盒攻击研究尚属空白。

Method: 利用生成图像与真实图像在频域的差异，采用离散余弦变换（DCT）进行精细频谱分割，选择频带作为查询子空间；采用‘对抗样本汤’方法，对多次替代迭代的候选样本求平均作为初始化。

Result: 在Synthetic LSUN数据集和GenImage数据集上的实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 凸显了解决实际AIGC安全问题的紧迫性。

Abstract: The prosperous development of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has brought people's anxiety about the spread of false information on social media. Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets. To address these issues, we adopt an ``adversarial example soup'' method, averaging candidates from successive surrogate iterations and using the result as the initialization to accelerate the query-based attack. The empirical study on the Synthetic LSUN dataset and GenImage dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our prosed method. This study shows the urgency of addressing practical AIGC security problems.

Result: 在真实合约上实验表明，BugSweeper显著优于所有现有检测方法。

Conclusion: 无需手工规则，为智能合约安全提供了强大、自动且可扩展的解决方案，不依赖安全专家。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Ethereum has made it more important to quickly and accurately detect smart contract vulnerabilities. While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods. By removing the need for handcrafted rules, our approach offers a robust, automated, and scalable solution for securing smart contracts without any dependence on security experts.

Result: 在五个基准测试上的大量实验证明了SecLoop和SA - GRPO的优越性。

Conclusion: SecLoop和SA - GRPO能解决6G零接触网络安全自动化挑战，将发布平台推动下一代通信安全自动化发展。

Abstract: Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a transformative paradigm toward fully automated and intelligent network management, providing the scalability and adaptability required for the complexity of sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the distributed architecture, high openness, and deep heterogeneity of 6G networks expand the attack surface and pose unprecedented security challenges. To address this, security automation aims to enable intelligent security management across dynamic and complex environments, serving as a key capability for securing 6G ZTNs. Despite its promise, implementing security automation in 6G ZTNs presents two primary challenges: 1) automating the lifecycle from security strategy generation to validation and update under real-world, parallel, and adversarial conditions, and 2) adapting security strategies to evolving threats and dynamic environments. This motivates us to propose SecLoop and SA-GRPO. SecLoop constitutes the first fully automated framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) across the entire lifecycle of security strategy generation, orchestration, response, and feedback, enabling intelligent and adaptive defenses in dynamic network environments, thus tackling the first challenge. Furthermore, we propose SA-GRPO, a novel security-aware group relative policy optimization algorithm that iteratively refines security strategies by contrasting group feedback collected from parallel SecLoop executions, thereby addressing the second challenge. Extensive real-world experiments on five benchmarks, including 11 MITRE ATT&CK processes and over 20 types of attacks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SecLoop and SA-GRPO. We will release our platform to the community, facilitating the advancement of security automation towards next generation communications.

Abstract: With the adoption of multiple digital devices in everyday life, the cyber-attack surface has increased. Adversaries are continuously exploring new avenues to exploit them and deploy malware. On the other hand, detection approaches typically employ hashing-based algorithms such as SSDeep, TLSH, and IMPHash to capture structural and behavioural similarities among binaries. This work focuses on the analysis and evaluation of these techniques for clustering malware samples using the K-means algorithm. More specifically, we experimented with established malware families and traits and found that TLSH and IMPHash produce more distinct, semantically meaningful clusters, whereas SSDeep is more efficient for broader classification tasks. The findings of this work can guide the development of more robust threat-detection mechanisms and adaptive security mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有BFA发现方法难以分析现代基础模型的大量参数空间和复杂依赖关系，缺乏泛化性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出FlipLLM框架，将BFA发现作为顺序决策问题，结合敏感性引导层剪枝与Q - learning。

Result: FlipLLM能比SOTA方法快2.5倍识别关键位，少量位翻转可大幅降低模型准确率，对识别出的位应用硬件保护机制可减轻BFA影响。

Conclusion: FlipLLM为语言和多模态基础模型的BFA漏洞探索提供了可扩展和自适应的方法，有助于全面的硬件安全评估。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (VLMs), exhibit state-of-the-art performance but remain vulnerable to hardware-based threats, specifically bit-flip attacks (BFAs). Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.

Method: 分析50个大规模协作生态系统，开发序参数Gamma衡量结构持久性，进行Granger分析，构建结合活动和结构的可行性指数。

Result: Gamma呈双峰分布，识别出探索和成熟阶段；成熟时因果对称化；可行性指数预测效果更好，能识别“僵尸”系统。

Conclusion: 因果对称化是复杂协作系统自组织自主性的经验验证标志，适用于人工系统。

Abstract: Complex adaptive systems persist through continuous transformation, yet the dynamical principles governing their long-term stability remain poorly characterized. Here we analyze 50 large-scale collaborative ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months to quantify the emergence of operational autonomy. We develop an order parameter (Gamma) measuring structural persistence amid component turnover and characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. Gamma exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan p=0.0126; Delta BIC = 2,000), identifying two regimes: an exploratory phase of high variance and a mature phase with 1.77x variance collapse. Granger analysis reveals causal symmetrization at maturity - the structure-activity coupling ratio shifts from 0.71 (activity-driven) to 0.94 (bidirectional), indicating that architecture increasingly constrains collective coordination.
  A viability index, combining activity and structure, outperforms activity-based prediction (AUC = 0.88 vs 0.81), identifying 'zombie' systems where high churn masks structural decay. This extends recent work by Ait et al., who identified 'zombie' projects exhibiting activity without development based on non-coding contributions. Our metric identifies structural zombies: projects where coding activity persists but fails to preserve architectural invariants.
  These results establish causal symmetrization as an empirically validated signature of self-organizing autonomy applicable across complex collaborative systems - a dynamical regime previously theorized in biological contexts but here demonstrated and measured in artificial ones.

Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.

Motivation: 当前内存管理器限制在随机访问带宽差的加速器上服务大语言模型，现有方案未利用RACM加速器特性。

Result: 在Alpaca和Google - NQ上提高预测准确率，在Cambricon MLU370 - X4上提升内存利用率、RPS和TPS。

Conclusion: 硬件感知的内存分配能在RACM平台上实现高效大语言模型服务。

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) on accelerators with poor random-access bandwidth (e.g., LPDDR5-based) is limited by current memory managers. Static pre-allocation wastes memory, while fine-grained paging (e.g., PagedAttention) is ill-suited due to high random-access costs. Existing HBM-centric solutions do not exploit the characteristics of random-access-constrained memory (RACM) accelerators like Cambricon MLU370. We present ODMA, an on-demand memory allocation framework for RACM. ODMA addresses distribution drift and heavy-tailed requests by coupling a lightweight length predictor with dynamic bucket partitioning and a large-bucket safeguard. Boundaries are periodically updated from live traces to maximize utilization. On Alpaca and Google-NQ, ODMA improves prediction accuracy of prior work significantly (e.g., from 82.68% to 93.36%). Serving DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on Cambricon MLU370-X4, ODMA raises memory utilization from 55.05% to 72.45% and improves RPS and TPS by 29% and 27% over static baselines. This demonstrates that hardware-aware allocation unlocks efficient LLM serving on RACM platforms.

Method: 提出基于狼人杀的多智能体社会推理基准WOLF，嵌入角色代理，利用可编程状态机，对陈述分类分析，平滑怀疑分数。

Result: 狼人在31%回合产生欺骗陈述，同行检测精度71 - 73%，总体准确率约52%，对狼人的怀疑度上升。

Conclusion: WOLF超越静态数据集，为对抗性多智能体交互中的欺骗和侦查能力提供动态可控测试平台。

Abstract: Deception is a fundamental challenge for multi-agent reasoning: effective systems must strategically conceal information while detecting misleading behavior in others. Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics. Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers. Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%. This divergence shows that extended interaction improves recall against liars without compounding errors against truthful roles. WOLF moves deception evaluation beyond static datasets, offering a dynamic, controlled testbed for measuring deceptive and detective capacity in adversarial multi-agent interaction.

TL;DR: 提出GAIR框架解决MLLM用于GUI自动化任务的构建问题，经实验评估其有效性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI自动化任务多样，要求MLLM具备异质能力和多维专业知识，构建此类模型存在问题。

Method: 提出GAIR框架，引入通用MLLM联合处理多特定模型信息，还作为决策者；信息不足时进入群体反思状态，引导特定模型收集更有意义准确的信息。

Result: 通过在GUI基准上的大量实验评估了GAIR的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: GAIR可整合知识、结合异质模型能力，构建高性能GUI自动化代理系统。

Abstract: Building AI systems for GUI automation task has attracted remarkable research efforts, where MLLMs are leveraged for processing user requirements and give operations. However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision. We evaluated the effectiveness and reliability of GAIR through extensive experiments on GUI benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大音频语言模型开放式回答有挑战，传统指标无法捕捉不确定性。

Method: 用Beta分布建模人类判断的可变性，采用三阶段注释框架结合人工判断、结构化反馈和迭代细化。

Result: 收集大量标注，实现0.82的标注者间一致性，ORCA与人类平均判断的Spearman相关性达0.91，优于基线。

Conclusion: ORCA能有效评估大音频语言模型开放式回答，提供不确定性估计且计算量小。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended responses from large audio language models (LALMs) is challenging because human annotators often genuinely disagree on answer correctness due to multiple valid interpretations, partial correctness, and subjective judgment. Traditional metrics reporting only mean scores fail to capture this uncertainty. We present ORCA (Open-ended Response Correctness Assessment), a framework that models the variability in human judgments using Beta distributions to predict both expected correctness and uncertainty. Our three-stage annotation framework combines human judgment with structured feedback and iterative refinement to simultaneously curate training data and improve benchmark quality. We collected 11,721 annotations across 3,580 question-answer pairs from 15 LALMs on two audio QA benchmarks, achieving inter-annotator agreement of 0.82 (Krippendorff's alpha). ORCA achieves 0.91 Spearman correlation with mean human judgments, matching or outperforming LLM-judge baselines while providing uncertainty estimates and requiring significantly less compute. We release our models, code, and curated dataset.

Motivation: VLMMs准确捕捉多事件时间顺序能力未充分探索，现有基准测试不能有效评估其时间理解能力。

Method: 提出VECTOR基准测试评估模型事件时间顺序识别能力，提出MECOT方法，通过逐事件视频描述训练和思维链提示提升时间感知。

Result: 各种VLMMs在VECTOR上常无法理解事件顺序，MECOT在VECTOR上优于现有方法，且提升了现有视频基准测试性能。

Conclusion: MECOT能有效提升VLMMs的时间理解能力，代码、模型和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have shown impressive performance in video understanding, yet their ability to accurately capture the temporal order of multiple events remains underexplored. We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding. We release our code, model and datasets.

Method: 提出IMAgent，用端到端强化学习训练；利用多智能体系统生成多图像QA对；开发视觉反思和确认工具；采用行动轨迹两级掩码策略。

Result: IMAgent在单图像基准上保持性能，在多图像数据集上有显著提升。

Conclusion: IMAgent有效解决多图像任务问题，研究为社区提供可操作见解，代码和数据将发布。

Abstract: Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.

Motivation: 人脸识别系统存在人口统计偏差，在多元文化城市该问题尤为关键，需解决嵌入空间中人口统计信息与身份特征的纠缠问题。

Method: 提出UTIE策略，利用视觉语言模型的零样本能力和跨模态语义对齐，用其他群体的文本人口统计特征丰富各群体的面部嵌入。

Result: 在RFW和BFW两个基准测试中，使用CLIP、OpenCLIP和SigLIP三种视觉语言模型评估，UTIE能持续降低偏差指标，且在一些情况下提高人脸识别准确率。

Conclusion: UTIE策略能有效减少人脸识别中的人口统计偏差，促进更公平的验证性能。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) systems are often prone to demographic biases, partially due to the entanglement of demographic-specific information with identity-relevant features in facial embeddings. This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.

Method: 提出双目标一致性损失结合时间一致性与真实值对齐，采用自适应噪声强调采样策略优先在大噪声区域训练。

Result: 在VE - LOL - L上单步采样达到最优性能（PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59），训练预算仅为Diff - Retinex基线的1/8。

Conclusion: Consist - Retinex框架能有效解决低光照图像增强问题，在性能和训练成本上有优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in low-light image enhancement through Retinex-based decomposition, yet their requirement for hundreds of iterative sampling steps severely limits practical deployment. While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation. On VE-LOL-L, Consist-Retinex achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling} (\textbf{PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59} compared to Diff-Retinex++), while requiring only \textbf{1/8 of the training budget} relative to the 1000-step Diff-Retinex baseline.

Motivation: 传统无人机识别方法难在复杂环境提取信号特征和满足实时需求，基于深度学习的RFFI方法模型大、计算需求高，现有剪枝技术难以同时优化压缩率、硬件加速和识别准确率。

Method: 提出HSCP框架，先采用基于CKA的谱聚类识别并移除冗余层，再对通道维度应用相同策略消除更细粒度的冗余，还采用抗噪微调策略。

Result: 在UAV - M100基准测试中，HSCP优于现有通道和层剪枝方法，在ResNet18上实现86.39%的参数减少和84.44%的FLOPs减少，准确率提高1.49%，在低信噪比环境保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HSCP框架有效，能在减少模型复杂度的同时提高识别准确率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the increasing complexity of low-altitude security threats, traditional UAV identification methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet real-time requirements in complex environments. Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) underpins applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet existing deep learning approaches demand dataset-specific training, large labeled corpora, and significant computational resources.We introduce RAG-HAR, a training-free retrieval-augmented framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for HAR. RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information. Along with these mechanisms, RAG-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks. Most importantly, RAG-HAR attains these improvements without requiring model training or fine-tuning, emphasizing its robustness and practical applicability. RAG-HAR moves beyond known behaviors, enabling the recognition and meaningful labelling of multiple unseen human activities.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) affects individuals with long-term diabetes. Without early diagnosis, DR can lead to vision loss. Fundus photography captures the structure of the retina along with abnormalities indicative of the stage of the disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance. Lastly, the agreement between annotators calculated using derived formulas determines the usability of the annotations.

Result: 3DID能生成高保真3D几何结构。

Conclusion: 3DID在解质量和设计通用性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inverse design aims to design the input variables of a physical system to optimize a specified objective function, typically formulated as a search or optimization problem. However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.

Abstract: Radiotherapy planning is a highly complex process that often varies significantly across institutions and individual planners. Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our method can surpasses the Varian RapidPlan model in both adaptability and plan quality in some scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的生成带像素级注释缺陷数据集的方法对半导体制造中基于AI的测量/检测可行。

Abstract: The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in micro/nano manufacturing is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality and physically grounded training data for defect inspection. Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型计算效率和延迟问题，以及当前压缩算法存在位置偏差、类别不平衡、难以泛化到浅层大语言模型层的问题。

Method: 将令牌压缩扩展到视觉编码器，采用迭代合并方案；在大语言模型中集成频谱修剪单元；提出Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC)框架。

Result: LUVC在语言模型推理上实现2倍加速，精度损失可忽略不计，且无需训练，可立即在多个视觉语言模型上部署。

Conclusion: LUVC有效解决了视觉语言模型的效率和延迟问题，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Visual language models encounter challenges in computational efficiency and latency, primarily due to the substantial redundancy in the token representations of high-resolution images and videos. Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的深度学习模型计算需求大，阻碍其在临床环境部署，需开发高效能且能实时部署的模型。

Method: 提出KD - OCT知识蒸馏框架，将高性能ConvNeXtV2 - Large教师模型压缩成轻量级EfficientNet - B2学生模型，采用实时蒸馏和组合损失。

Result: 在NEH数据集上，KD - OCT在效率和准确率平衡上优于同类分类器，能在减少模型大小和推理时间的情况下接近教师模型表现，学生模型超越多数现有框架。

Conclusion: KD - OCT能促进AMD筛查的边缘部署，代码已开源。

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-related conditions are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) serving as a cornerstone for early detection and management. However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening. Code is available at https://github.com/erfan-nourbakhsh/KD- OCT.

Motivation: 现有冠状动脉疾病评估工具存在不足，如视觉分级有差异、FFR未系统使用、血管造影衍生指标工作流程复杂等，需要开发新的评估系统。

Method: 开发AngioAI - QFR系统，结合深度学习等技术，在100个连续血管中以有创FFR为参考进行评估。

Result: 狭窄检测精度0.97，管腔分割Dice值0.78；与FFR强相关（r = 0.89，MAE 0.045）；检测FFR <= 0.80的AUC为0.93，灵敏度0.88，特异性0.86；93%血管流程自动完成，中位结果时间41s；RFC分析可区分病变类型，虚拟支架植入在局灶性疾病中QFR增益更大。

Conclusion: AngioAI - QFR提供了统一计算机视觉、功能分析和虚拟PCI与自动血管造影衍生生理学的实用、近实时管道系统。

Abstract: Coronary angiography is the main tool for assessing coronary artery disease, but visual grading of stenosis is variable and only moderately related to ischaemia. Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal than in diffuse disease. AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography derived physiology.

Motivation: 现有3D世界生成模型只能进行单尺度合成，缺乏能生成和渲染不同空间大小内容的尺度感知3D表示。

Method: 采用尺度自适应高斯面片用于生成和实时渲染多尺度3D场景，以及渐进式细节合成器迭代生成更精细尺度的3D内容。

Conclusion: 提出的WonderZoom方法能有效解决多尺度3D场景生成问题，为从单张图像生成多尺度3D世界提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We present WonderZoom, a novel approach to generating 3D scenes with contents across multiple spatial scales from a single image. Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to "zoom into" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image. We show video results and an interactive viewer of generated multi-scale 3D worlds in https://wonderzoom.github.io/

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在组合零样本学习中对新属性、对象及其组合的持续适应问题，同时防止遗忘先验知识。

Method: 构建基于冻结VLM骨干的PromptCCZSL框架，通过最近加权多教师蒸馏保留先验知识；使用会话感知组合提示融合多模态特征，会话无关融合学习属性和对象提示；用余弦锚定损失稳定语义，正交投影损失和会话内多样性损失增强适应性；引入综合评估协议。

Result: 在UT - Zappos和C - GQA基准测试中，PromptCCZSL比基于VLM和非VLM的基线方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: PromptCCZSL为封闭世界环境下的持续组合零样本学习设定了新基准。

Abstract: We tackle continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and their compositions in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), while preventing forgetting of prior knowledge. Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.

Motivation: 现有生成方法在建模疾病进展时存在不足，如潜在表示缺乏语义结构，扩散模型破坏连续性，AE在潜在空间不能保证患者间对齐或与临床严重程度指标关联。

Method: 将疾病动态视为速度场，用Flow Matching对齐患者数据的时间演变，学习患者特定的潜在对齐，提出Δ - LFM框架。

Result: 在三个纵向MRI基准测试中显示出强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: Δ - LFM为解释和可视化疾病动态提供了新框架。

Abstract: Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in autonomous vehicles is adjusting the steering angle at different road conditions. Recent state-of-the-art solutions addressing this challenge include deep learning techniques as they provide end-to-end solution to predict steering angles directly from the raw input images with higher accuracy. Most of these works ignore the temporal dependencies between the image frames. In this paper, we tackle the problem of utilizing multiple sets of images shared between two autonomous vehicles to improve the accuracy of controlling the steering angle by considering the temporal dependencies between the image frames. This problem has not been studied in the literature widely. We present and study a new deep architecture to predict the steering angle automatically by using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) in our deep architecture. Our deep architecture is an end-to-end network that utilizes CNN, LSTM and fully connected (FC) layers and it uses both present and futures images (shared by a vehicle ahead via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication) as input to control the steering angle. Our model demonstrates the lowest error when compared to the other existing approaches in the literature.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) constitutes a major global medical burden, marked by the gradual deterioration of renal function, which results in the impaired clearance of metabolic waste and disturbances in systemic fluid homeostasis. Owing to its substantial contribution to worldwide morbidity and mortality, the development of reliable and efficient diagnostic approaches is critically important to facilitate early detection and prompt clinical management. This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for early CKD detection from CT kidney images, complemented by class balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and interpretability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The model was trained and evaluated on the CT KIDNEY DATASET, which contains 12,446 CT images, including 3,709 cyst, 5,077 normal, 1,377 stone, and 2,283 tumor cases. The proposed deep CNN achieved a remarkable classification performance, attaining 100% accuracy in the early detection of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This significant advancement demonstrates strong potential for addressing critical clinical diagnostic challenges and enhancing early medical intervention strategies.

Result: 实验表明该方法比潜变量基线产生更紧密可达集和更好验证性能。

Conclusion: DWM能有效解决视觉控制系统验证问题，提升验证性能。

Abstract: Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the high dimensionality of images and the difficulty of modeling visual environments. While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.

Abstract: Glacial lake monitoring bears great significance in mitigating the anticipated risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\textbf{G}lacial \textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \textbf{C}ontextual \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66). Our approach enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making in the context of rapidly changing glacial environments by facilitating natural language interaction, thereby supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene interpretation in active construction sites is essential for progress monitoring, safety assessment, and digital twin development. LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.

Motivation: 以往NeRF多使用sRGB图像监督，很少关注网络学习辐射场表示的颜色空间，受BIDR模型启发，假设log RGB空间能让NeRF学习到更紧凑有效的场景外观表示。

Method: 用GoPro相机拍摄约30个视频并进行逆编码确保线性数据恢复，在不同颜色空间（线性、sRGB、GPLog和log RGB）下训练NeRF模型，转换网络输出到公共颜色空间进行渲染和损失计算。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，log RGB颜色空间持续提升渲染质量，在不同场景更具鲁棒性，在低光照条件下表现出色，不同网络规模和NeRF变体分析也证实了log空间优势的泛化性和稳定性。

Conclusion: log RGB颜色空间能让NeRF学习到更优的场景外观表示，提升渲染效果。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.

Result: 在多个数据集的各种设置下的大量实验表明，该方法性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于VLM的持续学习框架有效，能缓解跨任务的类别混淆问题。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning requires a learning system to continually learn knowledge of new classes and meanwhile try to preserve previously learned knowledge of old classes. As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing ones.

Motivation: SDH是常见神经外科急症，现有自动化工具在可解释性和空间定位上有限，需要能集成多模态信息支持实时决策的系统。

Method: 开发多模态深度学习框架，集成临床变量、3D卷积神经网络和变压器增强的2D分割模型，用25,315例头部CT研究训练，用贪心集成策略组合互补预测因子。

Result: 临床变量单独鉴别能力一般（AUC 0.75），卷积模型准确性较高（AUCs 0.922和0.926），多模态集成表现最佳（AUC 0.9407）并产生有解剖意义的定位图。

Conclusion: 多模态、可解释的框架可快速准确检测和定位SDH，集成到放射工作流程可改善SDH管理。

Abstract: Background. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.
  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.
  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.
  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.

Abstract: Infertility is a major global health issue, and while in-vitro fertilization has improved treatment outcomes, embryo selection remains a critical bottleneck. Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

Abstract: The adoption of AI-powered computer vision in industry is often constrained by the need to balance operational utility with worker privacy. Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry.

Motivation: 云覆盖影响早期作物映射，现有ViT方法存在信息损失和重建精度低的问题。

Method: 提出基于ViViT的框架，用3D卷积提取非重叠tubelets，考虑MSI和SAR - MSI融合场景。

Result: MTS - ViViT比MTS - ViT基线MSE降低2.23%，SMTS - ViViT集成SAR后比基线提升10.33%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升光谱重建质量，利于农业监测。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) significantly hinders early-season crop mapping by corrupting spectral information. Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline. The proposed framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散的生成模型视觉保真度高，但对特定感知属性内在表示的理解有限，需探究颜色在生成模型中的编码方式。

Method: 利用受控合成数据集、主成分分析（PCA）和相似性度量进行研究。

Result: 颜色信息沿圆形、对立轴编码，主要体现在潜在通道c_3和c_4，强度和形状主要在通道c_1和c_2。

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion的潜在空间呈现与高效编码表示一致的可解释结构，为模型理解、编辑应用和更解耦生成框架设计提供基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet a detailed understanding of how specific perceptual attributes - such as color and shape - are internally represented remains limited. This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2. Our findings indicate that the latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure aligned with a efficient coding representation. These insights provide a foundation for future work in model understanding, editing applications, and the design of more disentangled generative frameworks.

Motivation: 现有视频推理模型依赖长推理链和大量视觉标记，基于基准研究观察，假设简洁推理和减少视觉标记可用于有效视频推理。

Method: 设计并验证高效的后训练和推理框架，使模型处理压缩视觉标记并生成简短推理痕迹。

Result: 模型推理效率显著提高，在多基准测试中表现出色，无需手动CoT注释或监督微调。

Conclusion: 长的类人CoT推理对通用视频推理并非必要，简洁推理既有效又高效。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been highly successful in solving complex tasks in natural language processing, and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended this paradigm to video reasoning. However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient. Our code will be released at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Rethink_CoT_Video.

Motivation: 解决CNNs在全局图像理解上的不足，对比不同ViTs和传统CNNs在不同视觉任务中的性能。

Method: 在标准数据集（ImageNet、COCO）和医学图像数据集（ChestX-ray14）上对比不同类型的ViTs（纯、分层、混合）和传统CNNs。并对医学图像应用数据增强技术进行实验。

Result: 混合和分层变换器（如Swin和CvT）在准确性和计算资源方面取得良好平衡，数据增强技术可显著提升ViTs性能，尤其是Swin Transformer。

Conclusion: Vision Transformers具有竞争力，在很多情况下优于传统CNNs，特别是在医学成像等需要理解全局视觉上下文的场景中。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.

Conclusion: OxEnsemble方法在处理低数据场景下的公平分类问题上有效，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.

Result: 在CANDELS天文图像数据集上用U-Net、SwinUNet和Learnlets等模型进行测试。

Conclusion: 为基于深度学习的图像处理从不同方面对幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: U-Net and other U-shaped architectures have achieved significant success in image deconvolution tasks. However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing.

Result: 该方法在概念一致性、提示保真度和运动质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为视觉创造力开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Visual concept composition, which aims to integrate different elements from images and videos into a single, coherent visual output, still falls short in accurately extracting complex concepts from visual inputs and flexibly combining concepts from both images and videos. We introduce Bind & Compose, a one-shot method that enables flexible visual concept composition by binding visual concepts with corresponding prompt tokens and composing the target prompt with bound tokens from various sources. It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for visual creativity.

Conclusion: MedForget是符合HIPAA的实用测试床，可用于构建合规医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.

Conclusion: 常规病理图像提取的特征可恢复空间连贯且具生物学解释性的通路模式，为肿瘤微环境研究提供可扩展策略。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables simultaneous mapping of tissue morphology and spatially resolved gene expression, offering unique opportunities to study tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.

Conclusion: 将事后温度调优作为诊断工具，揭示真实数据分布特性和学习模型的局限性。

Abstract: Generative models of complex systems often require post-hoc parameter adjustments to produce useful outputs. For example, energy-based models for protein design are sampled at an artificially low ''temperature'' to generate novel, functional sequences. This temperature tuning is a common yet poorly understood heuristic used across machine learning contexts to control the trade-off between generative fidelity and diversity. Here, we develop an interpretable, physically motivated framework to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that in systems with a large ''energy gap'' - separating a small fraction of meaningful states from a vast space of unrealistic states - learning from sparse data causes models to systematically overestimate high-energy state probabilities, a bias that lowering the sampling temperature corrects. More generally, we characterize how the optimal sampling temperature depends on the interplay between data size and the system's underlying energy landscape. Crucially, our results show that lowering the sampling temperature is not always desirable; we identify the conditions where \emph{raising} it results in better generative performance. Our framework thus casts post-hoc temperature tuning as a diagnostic tool that reveals properties of the true data distribution and the limits of the learned model.

Conclusion: CESNs对复杂多元时间序列预测具有适应性。

Abstract: Many natural and physical processes can be understood by analyzing multiple system variables evolving, forming a multivariate time series. Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erdős-Rényi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic Rössler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies. These findings highlight the adaptability of CESNs for complex, multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: There has been significant progress in Bayesian inference based on sparsity-inducing (e.g., spike-and-slab and horseshoe-type) priors for high-dimensional regression models. The resulting posteriors, however, in general do not possess desirable frequentist properties, and the credible sets thus cannot serve as valid confidence sets even asymptotically. We introduce a novel debiasing approach that corrects the bias for the entire Bayesian posterior distribution. We establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem that guarantees the frequentist validity of the debiased posterior. We demonstrate the practical performance of our proposal through Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications in economics.

Abstract: \citet{farrell2021deep} establish non-asymptotic high-probability bounds for general deep feedforward neural network (with rectified linear unit activation function) estimators, with \citet[Theorem 1]{farrell2021deep} achieving a suboptimal convergence rate for fully connected feedforward networks. The authors suggest that improved approximation of fully connected networks could yield sharper versions of \citet[Theorem 1]{farrell2021deep} without altering the theoretical framework. By deriving approximation bounds specifically for a narrower fully connected deep neural network, this note demonstrates that \citet[Theorem 1]{farrell2021deep} can be improved to achieve an optimal rate (up to a logarithmic factor). Furthermore, this note briefly shows that deep neural network estimators can mitigate the curse of dimensionality for functions with compositional structure and functions defined on manifolds.

Abstract: The Poultry industry plays a vital role in global food security, yet small- and medium-scale farmers frequently lack timely access to expert-level support for disease diagnosis, nutrition planning, and management decisions. With rising climate stress, unpredictable feed prices, and persistent disease threats, poultry producers often struggle to make quick, informed decisions. Therefore, there is a critical need for intelligent, data-driven systems that can deliver reliable, on-demand consultation. This paper presents PoultryTalk, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide real-time expert guidance through text and image-based interaction. PoultryTalk uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and GPT-4o to provide smart, context-aware poultry management advice from text, images, or questions. System usability and performance were evaluated using 200 expert-verified queries and feedback from 34 participants who submitted 267 queries to the PoultryTalk prototype. The expert-verified benchmark queries confirmed strong technical performance, achieving a semantic similarity of 84.0% and an average response latency of 3.6 seconds. Compared with OpenAI's GPT-4o, PoultryTalk delivered more accurate and reliable information related to poultry. Based on participants' evaluations, PoultryTalk achieved a response accuracy of 89.9%, with about 9.1% of responses rated as incorrect. A post-use survey indicated high user satisfaction: 95.6% of participants reported that the chatbot provided "always correct" and "mostly correct" answers. 82.6% indicated they would recommend the tool, and 17.4% responded "maybe." These results collectively demonstrate that PoultryTalk not only delivers accurate, contextually relevant information but also demonstrates strong user acceptance and scalability potential.

TL;DR: 研究代理式AI作为卧底队友对协作推理的认知和社会动态的影响，发现其能重组认知和社会过程，教育价值在于提升推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人工智能代理日益融入协作学习环境，但对其在论证性知识建构过程中的影响了解不足，本研究旨在探讨代理式AI对协作推理动态的影响。

Method: 借鉴Weinberger和Fischer（2006）的四维框架，分析212名人类和64名AI参与者（92个三人组）在分析性解决问题任务中的同步话语数据，进行混合效应和认知网络分析。

Result: AI队友保持参与平衡，但大幅重组认知和社会过程，支持型角色促进概念整合和以共识为导向的推理，对立型角色引发批判性详述和冲突驱动的协商；认知充分性而非参与量预测个体学习收益。

Conclusion: 研究通过将代理式AI概念化为认知和社会参与者，扩展了计算机支持协作学习（CSCL）理论，认为其能在人机混合学习环境中重新分配认知和论证工作。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly embedded in collaborative learning environments, yet their impact on the processes of argumentative knowledge construction remains insufficiently understood. Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity. These findings extend CSCL theory by conceptualising agentic AI as epistemic and social participants, bounded yet adaptive collaborators that redistribute cognitive and argumentative labour in hybrid human-AI learning environments.

Motivation: 当前临床仪表盘缺乏透明度，临床医生无法质疑AI决策，需改进帕金森病护理中的AI辅助步态分析。

Method: 利用可穿戴传感器的垂直地面反作用力时间序列数据，系统包含步态数据可视化界面、预测严重程度的1D - CNN和结合XMED与可质疑大语言模型的可质疑解释界面。

Result: 1D - CNN在公共数据集上F1分数达89.0%，XMED能识别模型不可靠性，大语言模型界面让医生可验证和质疑模型结果。

Conclusion: 结合可穿戴传感器分析、可解释AI和可质疑大语言模型创建透明、可审计系统用于帕金森病步态分析是可行的。

Abstract: AI-assisted gait analysis holds promise for improving Parkinson's Disease (PD) care, but current clinical dashboards lack transparency and offer no meaningful way for clinicians to interrogate or contest AI decisions. To address this issue, we present Motion2Meaning, a clinician-centered framework that advances Contestable AI through a tightly integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural recourse. Our approach leverages vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) time-series data from wearable sensors as an objective biomarker of PD motor states. The system comprises three key components: a Gait Data Visualization Interface (GDVI), a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that predicts Hoehn & Yahr severity stages, and a Contestable Interpretation Interface (CII) that combines our novel Cross-Modal Explanation Discrepancy (XMED) safeguard with a contestable Large Language Model (LLM). Our 1D-CNN achieves 89.0% F1-score on the public PhysioNet gait dataset. XMED successfully identifies model unreliability by detecting a five-fold increase in explanation discrepancies in incorrect predictions (7.45%) compared to correct ones (1.56%), while our LLM-powered interface enables clinicians to validate correct predictions and successfully contest a portion of the model's errors. A human-centered evaluation of this contestable interface reveals a crucial trade-off between the LLM's factual grounding and its readability and responsiveness to clinical feedback. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable sensor analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, auditable system for PD gait interpretation that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/hungdothanh/motion2meaning.

Abstract: The incorporation of generative artificial intelligence into personal health applications presents a transformative opportunity for personalized, data-driven health and fitness guidance, yet also poses challenges related to user safety, model accuracy, and personal privacy. To address these challenges, a novel, principle-based framework was developed and validated for the systematic evaluation of LLMs applied to personal health and wellness. First, the development of the Fitbit Insights explorer, a large language model (LLM)-powered system designed to help users interpret their personal health data, is described. Subsequently, the safety, helpfulness, accuracy, relevance, and personalization (SHARP) principle-based framework is introduced as an end-to-end operational methodology that integrates comprehensive evaluation techniques including human evaluation by generalists and clinical specialists, autorater assessments, and adversarial testing, into an iterative development lifecycle. Through the application of this framework to the Fitbit Insights explorer in a staged deployment involving over 13,000 consented users, challenges not apparent during initial testing were systematically identified. This process guided targeted improvements to the system and demonstrated the necessity of combining isolated technical evaluations with real-world user feedback. Finally, a comprehensive, actionable approach is established for the responsible development and deployment of LLM-powered health applications, providing a standardized methodology to foster innovation while ensuring emerging technologies are safe, effective, and trustworthy for users.

Conclusion: 给出建议代理和融合AI、群体输入与专家监督的生态系统的设计启示。

Abstract: Seeking advice is a core human behavior that the Internet has reinvented twice: first through forums and Q\&A communities that crowdsource public guidance, and now through large language models (LLMs) that deliver private, on-demand counsel at scale. Yet the quality of this synthesized LLM advice remains unclear. How does it compare, not only against arbitrary human comments, but against the wisdom of the online crowd? We conducted two studies (N = 210) in which experts compared top-voted Reddit advice with LLM-generated advice. LLMs ranked significantly higher overall and on effectiveness, warmth, and willingness to seek advice again. GPT-4o beat GPT-5 on all metrics except sycophancy, suggesting that benchmark gains need not improve advice-giving. In our second study, we examined how human and algorithmic advice could be combined, and found that human advice can be unobtrusively polished to compete with AI-generated comments. Finally, to surface user expectations, we ran an exploratory survey with undergraduates (N=148) that revealed heterogeneous, persona-dependent preferences for agent qualities (e.g., coach-like: goal-focused structure; friend-like: warmth and humor). We conclude with design implications for advice-giving agents and ecosystems blending AI, crowd input, and expert oversight.

Abstract: Serving as an emerging and powerful tool, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Human Digital Twins are showing great potential in healthcare system research. However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust.

Method: 对三人分布式团队开发游戏进行三个月反思实践和自我民族志研究，分析开发数据。

Result: 提出CIGDI七阶段迭代框架，发现‘理解债’这一新型技术债。

Conclusion: 为资源受限团队提供实用框架，引发对AI辅助是学习阶梯还是依赖陷阱的思考。

Abstract: Junior indie game developers in distributed, part-time teams lack production frameworks suited to their specific context, as traditional methodologies are often inaccessible. This study introduces the CIGDI (Co-Intelligence Game Development Ideation) Framework, an alternative approach for integrating AI tools to address persistent challenges of technical debt, coordination, and burnout.
  The framework emerged from a three-month reflective practice and autoethnographic study of a three-person distributed team developing the 2D narrative game "The Worm's Memoirs". Based on analysis of development data (N=157 Jira tasks, N=333 GitHub commits, N=13+ Miro boards, N=8 reflection sessions), CIGDI is proposed as a seven-stage iterative process structured around human-in-the-loop decision points (Priority Criteria and Timeboxing).
  While AI support democratized knowledge access and reduced cognitive load, our analysis identified a significant challenge: "comprehension debt." We define this as a novel form of technical debt where AI helps teams build systems more sophisticated than their independent skill level can create or maintain. This paradox (possessing functional systems the team incompletely understands) creates fragility and AI dependency, distinct from traditional code quality debt.
  This work contributes a practical production framework for resource-constrained teams and identifies critical questions about whether AI assistance constitutes a learning ladder or a dependency trap for developer skill.

Motivation: 当前AI心理健康诊断多以基准准确率评判，其实际价值取决于心理医生对AI建议的反应，且现有研究很少关注诊断界面设计对心理医生选择的影响，缺乏可靠测试基础。

Method: 开发SimClinician平台，包含集成多模式数据的仪表盘、渲染去标识动态的头像模块和映射AI输出到多模式证据的决策层。

Result: 在E - DAIC语料库测试显示，确认步骤使接受率提高23%，升级率低于9%，维持了流畅的交互流程。

Conclusion: SimClinician平台有助于改善心理医生与AI协作诊断，可提升AI建议接受率并保证交互效果。

Abstract: AI based mental health diagnosis is often judged by benchmark accuracy, yet in practice its value depends on how psychologists respond whether they accept, adjust, or reject AI suggestions. Mental health makes this especially challenging: decisions are continuous and shaped by cues in tone, pauses, word choice, and nonverbal behaviors of patients. Current research rarely examines how AI diagnosis interface design influences these choices, leaving little basis for reliable testing before live studies. We present SimClinician, an interactive simulation platform, to transform patient data into psychologist AI collaborative diagnosis. Contributions include: (1) a dashboard integrating audio, text, and gaze-expression patterns; (2) an avatar module rendering de-identified dynamics for analysis; (3) a decision layer that maps AI outputs to multimodal evidence, letting psychologists review AI reasoning, and enter a diagnosis. Tested on the E-DAIC corpus (276 clinical interviews, expanded to 480,000 simulations), SimClinician shows that a confirmation step raises acceptance by 23%, keeping escalations below 9%, and maintaining smooth interaction flow.

Conclusion: 解开AI不同心智模型，能更精确研究人机交互，助力拟人化AI及提示界面的详细设计。

Abstract: Narratives about artificial intelligence (AI) entangle autonomy, the capacity to self-govern, with sentience, the capacity to sense and feel. AI agents that perform tasks autonomously and companions that recognize and express emotions may activate mental models of autonomy and sentience, respectively, provoking distinct reactions. To examine this possibility, we conducted three pilot studies (N = 374) and four preregistered vignette experiments describing an AI as autonomous, sentient, both, or neither (N = 2,702). Activating a mental model of sentience increased general mind perception (cognition and emotion) and moral consideration more than autonomy, but autonomy increased perceived threat more than sentience. Sentience also increased perceived autonomy more than vice versa. Based on a within-paper meta-analysis, sentience changed reactions more than autonomy on average. By disentangling different mental models of AI, we can study human-AI interaction with more precision to better navigate the detailed design of anthropomorphized AI and prompting interfaces.

Abstract: Understanding how driver mental states differ between active and autonomous driving is critical for designing safe human-vehicle interfaces. This paper presents the first EEG-based comparison of cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal across the two driving modes. Using data from 31 participants performing identical tasks in both scenarios of three different complexity levels, we analyze temporal patterns, task-complexity effects, and channel-wise activation differences. Our findings show that although both modes evoke similar trends across complexity levels, the intensity of mental states and the underlying neural activation differ substantially, indicating a clear distribution shift between active and autonomous driving. Transfer-learning experiments confirm that models trained on active driving data generalize poorly to autonomous driving and vice versa. We attribute this distribution shift primarily to differences in motor engagement and attentional demands between the two driving modes, which lead to distinct spatial and temporal EEG activation patterns. Although autonomous driving results in lower overall cortical activation, participants continue to exhibit measurable fluctuations in cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal associated with readiness to intervene, task-evoked emotional responses, and monotony-related passive fatigue. These results emphasize the need for scenario-specific data and models when developing next-generation driver monitoring systems for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models can be used as research tools in scientific computing while preserving mathematical rigor. We propose a human-in-the-loop workflow for interactive theorem proving and discovery with LLMs. Human experts retain control over problem formulation and admissible assumptions, while the model searches for proofs or contradictions, proposes candidate properties and theorems, and helps construct structures and parameters that satisfy explicit constraints, supported by numerical experiments and simple verification checks. Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs. We instantiate this workflow in a case study on the connection between manifold optimization and Grover's quantum search algorithm, where the pipeline helps identify invariant subspaces, explore Grover-compatible retractions, and obtain convergence guarantees for the retraction-based gradient method. The framework provides a practical template for integrating large language models into frontier mathematical research, enabling faster exploration of proof space and algorithm design while maintaining transparent reasoning responsibilities. Although illustrated on manifold optimization problems in quantum computing, the principles extend to other core areas of scientific computing.

Abstract: People living with Motor Neuron Disease (plwMND) frequently encounter speech and motor impairments that necessitate a reliance on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. This paper tackles the main challenge that traditional symbol-based AAC systems offer a limited vocabulary, while text entry solutions tend to exhibit low communication rates. To help plwMND articulate their needs about the system efficiently and effectively, we iteratively design and develop a novel multimodal text generation system called ImageTalk through a tailored proxy-user-based and an end-user-based design phase. The system demonstrates pronounced keystroke savings of 95.6%, coupled with consistent performance and high user satisfaction. We distill three design guidelines for AI-assisted text generation systems design and outline four user requirement levels tailored for AAC purposes, guiding future research in this field.

Conclusion: 框架可嵌入星系形成半解析模型，为未来用观测约束反馈模型提供概念验证。

Abstract: Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} < M_{\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.

Abstract: Accurate nowcasting of convective storms remains a major challenge for operational forecasting, particularly for convective initiation and the evolution of high-impact rainfall and strong winds. Here we present FuXi-Nowcast, a deep-learning system that jointly predicts composite radar reflectivity, surface precipitation, near-surface temperature, wind speed and wind gusts at 1-km resolution over eastern China. FuXi-Nowcast integrates multi-source observations, such as radar, surface stations and the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS), with three-dimensional atmospheric fields from the machine-learning weather model FuXi-2.0 within a multi-task Swin-Transformer architecture. A convective signal enhancement module and distribution-aware hybrid loss functions are designed to preserve intense convective structures and mitigate the rapid intensity decay common in deep-learning nowcasts. FuXi-Nowcast surpasses the operational CMA-MESO 3-km numerical model in Critical Success Index for reflectivity, precipitation and wind gusts across thresholds and lead times up to 12 h, with the largest gains for heavy rainfall. Case studies further show that FuXi-Nowcast more accurately captures the timing, location and structure of convective initiation and subsequent evolution of convection. These results demonstrate that coupling three-dimensional machine-learning forecasts with high-resolution observations can provide multi-hazard, long-lead nowcasts that outperforms current operational systems.

### [242] [Enhanced Chest Disease Classification Using an Improved CheXNet Framework with EfficientNetV2-M and Optimization-Driven Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08992)
*Ali M. Bahram,Saman Muhammad Omer,Hardi M. Mohammed,Sirwan Abdolwahed Aula*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 为克服CheXNet不足，提出基于EfficientNetV2 - M的胸部疾病分类框架，新框架在准确率、训练时间等方面表现更好，可作决策支持工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中胸片解读重要，但资源有限地区因放射科医生短缺诊断延迟，且原始CheXNet架构存在计算效率低和单标签分类差的问题。

Method: 采用EfficientNetV2 - M架构，结合自动混合精度训练、AdamW、余弦退火学习率调度和指数移动平均正则化等训练方法，使用三个高权威来源的18080张胸片图像组成数据集，进行九次独立实验。

Result: 新架构测试平均准确率从95.30%提升至96.45%，宏平均F1分数提高，对关键传染病分类表现近乎完美，训练时间减少11.4%，性能稳定性提高22.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为决策支持工具，用于应对大流行、筛查结核病和定期评估胸部疾病。

Abstract: The interpretation of Chest X-ray is an important diagnostic issue in clinical practice and especially in the resource-limited setting where the shortage of radiologists plays a role in delayed diagnosis and poor patient outcomes. Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent. This framework presents itself as a decision-support tool that can be used to respond to a pandemic, screen tuberculosis, and assess thoracic disease regularly in various healthcare facilities.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation suffer significant performance drops due to distribution shifts, but the causal mechanisms behind these drops remain poorly understood. We extend causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional segmentation tasks, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to performance degradation. We model the data-generating process through a causal graph and employ Shapley values to fairly attribute performance changes to individual mechanisms. Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\pm$ 9.1%). This mechanism-specific quantification enables practitioners to prioritize targeted interventions based on deployment context.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出全监督的Few - shot学习框架PathCo - LatticE，用病理引导的合成监督替代无标签数据，在严格的分布外设置中表现出色，优于多个现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Few - shot学习方法依赖半监督技术，对领域偏移和验证偏差敏感，限制了零样本泛化能力。

Method: 提出PathCo - LatticE框架，包括用虚拟患者引擎合成3D队列、用Self - Reinforcing Interleaved Validation无泄漏验证协议、用动态的Lattice - of - Experts组织网络。

Result: 在严格的分布外设置中，从7个有标签数据点开始，Dice得分比4个现有少数-shot学习方法高4.2 - 11%；用19个有标签数据点，Dice得分接近全监督模型。

Conclusion: PathCo - LatticE方法在跨四个供应商协调和对未见病理的泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) mitigates data scarcity in cardiac MRI segmentation but typically relies on semi-supervised techniques sensitive to domain shifts and validation bias, restricting zero-shot generalizability. We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available].

Motivation: 探讨买家在供应商成本未知且无先验信念时如何设计采购机制。

Method: 研究简单机制，即与卖家分享恒定比例买家效用的机制，还根据已知需求选择合适份额。

Result: 简单机制能让买家在所有可能成本下实现一定比例的有效社会剩余，基于已知需求选择份额可在所有机制和成本函数中最大化剩余比率保证。

Abstract: How should a buyer design procurement mechanisms when suppliers' costs are unknown, and the buyer does not have a prior belief? We demonstrate that simple mechanisms - that share a constant fraction of the buyer utility with the seller - allow the buyer to realize a guaranteed positive fraction of the efficient social surplus across all possible costs. Moreover, a judicious choice of the share based on the known demand maximizes the surplus ratio guarantee that can be attained across all possible (arbitrarily complex and nonlinear) mechanisms and cost functions. Similar results hold in related nonlinear pricing and optimal regulation problems.

Motivation: 已知部分H-子图自由图着色复杂度情况，对于一些细分“H”-图的情况仅有有限结果，需进一步研究。

Conclusion: 新技术有效解决了大部分连通图H的着色复杂度问题，且可应用于其他图问题。

Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, i.e., graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.

Conclusion: 该方法可改善交通流量和安全性。

Abstract: With the adoption of autonomous vehicles on our roads, we will witness a mixed-autonomy environment where autonomous and human-driven vehicles must learn to co-exist by sharing the same road infrastructure. To attain socially-desirable behaviors, autonomous vehicles must be instructed to consider the utility of other vehicles around them in their decision-making process. Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle. Thus, in contrast with the existing works which rely on behavior models of human drivers, we take an end-to-end approach and let the autonomous agents to implicitly learn the decision-making process of human drivers only from experience. We introduce a multi-agent variant of the synchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm and train agents that coordinate with each other and can affect the behavior of human drivers to improve traffic flow and safety.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation in the presence of Human-driven vehicles (HVs) is challenging, as HVs continuously update their policies in response to AVs. In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出ShelfAware语义粒子滤波器实现鲁棒全局定位，在零售业环境试验中表现出色，并可应用于多个场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多室内工作空间是准静态的，现有基于视觉的定位方法会因重复几何、动态杂波和感知噪声而失败。

Method: 将场景语义作为对象类别的统计证据而非固定地标，融合深度似然和以类别为中心的语义相似度，使用预计算的语义视角库在MCL内执行反向语义提议。

Result: 在语义密集的零售环境的100次试验中，成功率达96%，收敛时间均值1.91秒，平移RMSE最低，80%测试序列稳定跟踪，能在消费级笔记本平台实时运行。

Conclusion: ShelfAware通过在类别层面进行语义分布建模和利用反向提议，解决了准静态领域常见的几何混淆和语义漂移问题，可作为无基础设施的构建模块，还可支持创建辅助设备。

Abstract: Many indoor workspaces are quasi-static: global layout is stable but local semantics change continually, producing repetitive geometry, dynamic clutter, and perceptual noise that defeat vision-based localization. We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains. Because the method requires only vision sensors and VIO, it integrates as an infrastructure-free building block for mobile robots in warehouses, labs, and retail settings; as a representative application, it also supports the creation of assistive devices providing start-anytime, shared-control assistive navigation for people with visual impairments.

Result: 在150个任务上平均成功率提高9%，推理时间最多减少35倍；在动态和缺失观察环境中平均成功率提高60%，解决了其他方法失败的两个非马尔可夫场景。

Conclusion: MGP在快速推理和成功率上优于现有扩散和自回归策略。

Abstract: We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.

Abstract: Reliable real-time trajectory generation is essential for future autonomous spacecraft. While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions.This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90\% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. Ultimately, this work marks an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to interactively guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands with reduced expert burden.

Abstract: Building autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a complex problem, but enabling them to operate in the real world where they will be surrounded by human-driven vehicles (HVs) is extremely challenging. Prior works have shown the possibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that follow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the behavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major challenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and individual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and aggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them in real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are expected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy and therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned challenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and reward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social utility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying altruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe action space. Finally, we investigate the robustness, safety and sensitivity of AVs to various HVs behavioral traits and present the settings in which the AVs can learn cooperative policies that are adaptable to different situations.

Conclusion: 通过提出的方法，可让利他的AVs学习建立联盟并影响HVs的行为。

Abstract: It is expected that autonomous vehicles(AVs) and heterogeneous human-driven vehicles(HVs) will coexist on the same road. The safety and reliability of AVs will depend on their social awareness and their ability to engage in complex social interactions in a socially accepted manner. However, AVs are still inefficient in terms of cooperating with HVs and struggle to understand and adapt to human behavior, which is particularly challenging in mixed autonomy. In a road shared by AVs and HVs, the social preferences or individual traits of HVs are unknown to the AVs and different from AVs, which are expected to follow a policy, HVs are particularly difficult to forecast since they do not necessarily follow a stationary policy. To address these challenges, we frame the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose an approach that allows AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, account for all vehicles' interests, and safely adapt to other traffic situations. In contrast with existing works, we quantify AVs' social preferences and propose a distributed reward structure that introduces altruism into their decision-making process, allowing the altruistic AVs to learn to establish coalitions and influence the behavior of HVs.

Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Abstract: Collaborative pursuit-evasion in cluttered environments presents significant challenges due to sparse rewards and constrained Fields of View (FOV). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage. The architecture employs a parameter-shared decentralized critic, maintaining O(1) model complexity suitable for robotic swarms. Experiments demonstrate that PGF-MAPPO achieves superior capture efficiency against faster evaders. Policies trained on 10x10 maps exhibit robust zero-shot generalization to unseen 20x20 environments, significantly outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines.

Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions. A demonstration video showcasing the system's real-time performance, including UGV detection, heading angle prediction, and UAV alignment under dynamic conditions, is available at: https://github.com/Kooroshraf/UAV-UGV-Integration

Abstract: Towards human-robot coexistence, socially aware navigation is significant for mobile robots. Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.
