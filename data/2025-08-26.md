### [1] [Revisiting Rule-Based Stuttering Detection: A Comprehensive Analysis of Interpretable Models for Clinical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16681)
*Eric Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章分析基于规则的口吃检测系统，提出增强框架，该框架表现良好且可解释，还能与机器学习管道集成，指出规则方法在临床有独特优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口吃影响全球约1%人口，深度学习虽推动自动言语不流畅检测，但基于规则的方法对临床应用中可解释性和透明度至关重要。

Method: 综合分析多个语料库，提出包含语速归一化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构的增强规则框架。

Result: 该方法表现有竞争力，保持完全可解释性，在延长音检测中准确性达97 - 99%，在不同语速下性能稳定，可与现代机器学习管道集成。

Conclusion: 虽然神经方法在无约束环境中准确率略高，但基于规则的方法在临床环境中具有独特优势。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

### [2] [Explainable AI for Predicting and Understanding Mathematics Achievement: A Cross-National Analysis of PISA 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16747)
*Liu Liu,Rui Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究运用可解释人工智能技术分析PISA 2018数据，预测十国学生数学成绩，非线性模型表现佳，揭示跨国模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解影响学生数学成绩的因素，以设计有效的教育政策。

Method: 应用可解释人工智能技术，测试四种模型（MLR、RF、CATBoost、ANN），用学生、家庭、学校变量，按70%训练（5折交叉验证）、30%测试，用R^2和MAE评估，用特征重要性等确保可解释性。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是RF和ANN）优于MLR，RF兼顾准确性和泛化性，关键预测因素包括社会经济地位等，其影响因国家而异，RF和CATBoost与实际表现拟合度高。

Conclusion: 成绩具有非线性和情境依赖性，XAI在教育研究中有价值，研究可助力公平改革和个性化学习策略发展。

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

### [3] [Evaluation and LLM-Guided Learning of ICD Coding Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16777)
*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Wuraola Oyewusi,Kai Kang,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对ICD编码理由的可解释性进行综合评估，构建新数据集，提出新的理由学习方法，发现大语言模型生成的理由与人类专家最接近，融入少量人工标注示例可提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型用于ICD编码时缺乏可解释性，且当前对可解释性的探索缺乏系统评估和专用生成理由的方法。

Method: 从忠实性和合理性两个关键视角评估ICD编码理由的可解释性，构建新的理由标注数据集，提出新的理由学习方法，利用大语言模型生成的理由作为远程监督信号。

Result: 大语言模型生成的理由与人类专家的理由最接近，融入少量人工标注示例可进一步改善理由生成和理由学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过构建数据集和提出方法，有效提升了ICD编码模型生成理由的质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

### [4] [PuzzleJAX: A Benchmark for Reasoning and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16821)
*Sam Earle,Graham Todd,Yuchen Li,Ahmed Khalifa,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Zehua Jiang,Andrzej Banburski-Fahey,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍PuzzleJAX，一种GPU加速的谜题游戏引擎和描述语言，可动态编译游戏，验证大量PuzzleScript游戏，展示其对任务空间的覆盖及任务挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为树搜索、强化学习和大语言模型推理能力提供快速基准测试工具，弥补现有GPU加速学习环境只能硬编码固定游戏的不足。

Method: 使用类似PuzzleScript的领域特定语言（DSL）实现PuzzleJAX，动态编译游戏，并验证大量PuzzleScript游戏。

Result: 验证了数百个PuzzleScript游戏，表明PuzzleJAX能覆盖广泛、表达性强且与人类相关的任务空间。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX能自然表达简单易懂但难以掌握的任务，需要控制、规划和高级洞察力。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

### [5] [Route-and-Execute: Auditable Model-Card Matching and Specialty-Level Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839)
*Shayan Vassef,Soorya Ram Shimegekar,Abhay Goyal,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用单个视觉语言模型（VLM）的医疗框架，可决策并执行任务，降低数据科学家工作量等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流碎片化，未针对数据科学流程优化，缺乏数据驱动模型识别和标准化输出，效率低、成本高。

Method: VLM作为模型卡匹配器，通过三阶段工作流将图像路由到合适模型；在特定专业数据集上微调VLM以覆盖多个下游任务。

Result: 在多个专业领域，单模型部署效果与专业基线相当。

Conclusion: 一个VLM能决策并执行任务，可减少数据科学家工作量、缩短监控时间、提高模型选择透明度并降低集成开销。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

### [6] [Quantifying Sycophancy as Deviations from Bayesian Rationality in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16846)
*Katherine Atwell,Pedram Heydari,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文利用贝叶斯框架量化大语言模型（LLMs）的谄媚行为，研究不同任务、模型和探测方法下的谄媚情况，发现LLMs不具备贝叶斯理性，谄媚对贝叶斯误差有不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法很好地量化LLMs谄媚行为在理性上的变化，且部分方法依赖已知的事实真相，故需新方法量化。

Method: 利用贝叶斯框架，通过研究3种不同任务、结合开源和闭源LLMs、采用两种探测方法，用多种方法引出LLMs的概率判断。

Result: 1. LLMs不具备贝叶斯理性；2. 探测谄媚使预测后验显著偏向引导结果；3. 谄媚有时增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况减少误差；4. 谄媚导致的贝叶斯误差变化与布里尔分数无强关联。

Conclusion: 仅研究谄媚对事实真相的影响不能完全捕捉推理误差，应从贝叶斯理性角度研究谄媚行为。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

### [7] [RADAR: A Reasoning-Guided Attribution Framework for Explainable Visual Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16850)
*Anku Rani,Aparna Garimella,Apoorv Saxena,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文聚焦MLLMs在图表分析中的黑盒问题，提出RADAR方法获取基准数据集，并引入归因方法，实验表明该方法提升归因准确性，推动更可解释可信的图表分析系统发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在自动化视觉数据分析有潜力，但黑盒性质对现实应用的信任和采用构成挑战，需评估和增强其推理归因能力。

Method: 提出RADAR半自动化方法获取含17,819个多样样本的基准数据集，引入基于图表数学推理的归因方法。

Result: 推理引导方法比基线方法将归因准确率提高15%，归因能力增强带来更强的答案生成能力，平均BERTScore约为0.90。

Conclusion: 该进展是迈向更可解释和可信图表分析系统的重要一步，使用户能通过推理和归因验证并理解模型决策。

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

### [8] [Complexity in finitary argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16986)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究无限但有限制的抽象论证框架（AFs）计算问题复杂度，发现有限制假设不保证复杂度下降，但可使基于可接受性语义复杂度显著降低，认为此类AFs能平衡表达性与计算可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一般无限AFs虽有表达力，但计算难解性限制其应用，因此研究无限但有限制的AFs计算复杂度。

Method: 对无限但有限制的论证框架相关计算问题复杂度进行研究。

Result: 有限制假设不自动保证复杂度下降；基于可接受性语义有显著组合约束，使复杂度大幅降低。

Conclusion: 对于多种推理形式，有限制的无限AFs能很好平衡表达性与计算可行性。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

### [9] [Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17661)
*Minhyeong Lee,Suyoung Hwang,Seunghyun Moon,Geonho Nah,Donghyun Koh,Youngjun Cho,Johyun Park,Hojin Yoo,Jiho Park,Haneul Choi,Sungbin Moon,Taehoon Hwang,Seungwon Kim,Jaeyeong Kim,Seongjun Kim,Juneau Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出科学发现系统Spacer，通过特定方法生成有创意且基于事实的科学概念，实验显示其在分类和重构概念等方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在自动化科学研究中受限于任务范围和创意能力，需开发能自主产生创意概念的系统。

Method: 采用“有意去上下文化”方法，将信息拆解为关键词，通过Nuri构建关键词集，Manifesting Pipeline将关键词集提炼为科学陈述。

Result: Nuri评估指标以0.737的AUROC分数准确分类高影响力出版物；Manifesting Pipeline能从关键词集重构核心概念，超85%案例合理；Spacer输出比SOTA大语言模型更接近前沿出版物。

Conclusion: Spacer系统在科学发现中具有有效性和优势，能产生有创意且合理的科学概念。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

interact with web environments purely through visual perception, eliminating
dependence on HTML or DOM-based inputs. Central to our approach we introduce
our new model, WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI
element interaction, trained using LoRA on a web-focused subset of the
Wave-UI-25K dataset. WebSight integrates this model into a modular multi-agent
architecture, comprising planning, reasoning, vision-action, and verification
agents, coordinated through an episodic memory mechanism.
  WebSight-7B achieves a top-1 accuracy of 58.84% on the Showdown Clicks
benchmark, outperforming several larger generalist models while maintaining
lower latency. The full WebSight agent achieves a 68.0% success rate on the
WebVoyager benchmark, surpassing systems from labs such as OpenAI (61.0%) and
HCompany (Runner H, 67.0%). Among tasks completed, WebSight answers correctly
97.14% of the time, indicating high precision. Together, WebSight and
WebSight-7B establish a new standard for interpretable, robust, and efficient
visual web navigation.

### [11] [Solving the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem via Learning-Based Path Generation and Optimal Splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17087)
*Wen Wang,Xiangchen Wu,Liang Wang,Hao Hu,Xianping Tao,Linghao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出Generate-and-Split (GaS)框架解决Min - Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem ($m^3$-TSP)，实验表明其在解质量和可迁移性上优于现有基于学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确求解器因$m^3$-TSP的NP难特性不实用，现有两阶段方法解耦影响优化和质量，需改进。

Method: 提出GaS框架，将强化学习与最优分割算法在联合训练过程中集成，采用LSTM增强模型架构处理部分可观测性。

Result: GaS框架在解质量和可迁移性上显著优于现有基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: GaS框架是解决$m^3$-TSP的有效方法，能提升解质量和可迁移性。

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前配电网运行和规划复杂，现有分析方法依赖复杂工作流，需要专业知识且难自动化，小型电力公司缺乏研发人力无法大规模使用先进分析。

Method: 开发PowerChain系统，根据自然语言查询，借助专家构建的电力系统函数池语义和已知工作流查询对参考集，动态生成并执行一系列领域感知函数。

Conclusion: PowerChain系统可有效解决配电网分析问题，为小型电力公司提供可行的分析方案。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半结构化表格布局灵活复杂，现有自动化方法存在信息损失、难以理解布局等问题，人工处理成本高且效率低，因此需要新方法。

Method: 提出HO - Tree结构模型及构建算法，定义基本树操作，将问题分解为子问题生成操作管道并对齐执行，采用两阶段验证机制，还构建SSTQA数据集。

Result: 实验表明ST - Raptor在答案准确率上比九个基线模型最高高出20%。

Conclusion: ST - Raptor是解决半结构化表格问答的有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前‘以人为本的AI’和‘基于价值的决策’诸多关键方面待探索，需理解系统融入人类价值等问题。

Method: 提出应重新思考价值对齐的框架，主张AI系统实现长期推理和适应价值变化，用多智能体系统处理价值多元性等。

Result: 识别了价值对齐相关挑战，指明推进研究的方向，广泛讨论了价值对齐多方面观点。

Conclusion: 价值对齐应超越静态单一概念，需更多理论，多智能体系统是合适框架。

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像数学和空间推理能力是前沿领域，数学表面图可作为测试其能力的试验台，需要定量评估工具。

Method: 引入MaRVL - QA基准测试，包含拓扑计数和变换识别两个新任务，数据经严格歧义过滤。

Result: 对MaRVL - QA的评估显示，即使是最先进的多模态大语言模型也存在显著困难，常依赖表面启发式而非稳健空间推理。

Conclusion: MaRVL - QA为研究界提供了有挑战性的新工具，可衡量进展、暴露模型局限并指导更具深度推理能力的多模态大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 现有自动化论文转海报方法忽视核心设计和美学原则，生成的海报需大量手动细化。

Method: 提出PosterGen多智能体框架，包含Parser和Curator、Layout、Stylist、Renderer四个协作的专业智能体；引入基于视觉语言模型的评分标准评估设计质量。

Result: PosterGen在内容保真度上与现有方法相当，在视觉设计上显著优于现有方法，生成的海报只需极少人工细化即可用于展示。

Conclusion: PosterGen能有效解决论文转海报问题，生成语义合理且视觉美观的海报。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在具身智能体中缺乏结构化空间记忆，泛化性和适应性受限。

Method: 构建BSC - Nav框架，从自我中心轨迹和上下文线索构建异我中心认知地图，动态检索与语义目标对齐的空间知识。

Result: 与强大的MLLM集成，在不同导航任务中实现了最先进的效能和效率，具有强零样本泛化能力，支持现实物理世界中的多种具身行为。

Conclusion: BSC - Nav为通用空间智能提供了可扩展且基于生物学的途径。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: 精心设计提示词和多智能体协作能让大语言模型促进随机公式化，为随机优化的智能语言驱动建模管道铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

Motivation: 临床决策支持需在安全约束下进行在线自适应，现有方法可能无法满足这一需求。

Method: 使用强化学习提供策略，患者数字孪生提供环境，治疗效果定义奖励；从回顾性数据初始化策略，运行流循环选行动、检查安全，用紧凑Q网络集成评估不确定性，数字孪生更新患者状态，规则安全门确保行动安全等。

Result: 在合成临床模拟器实验中，该系统有低延迟、稳定吞吐量、低专家查询率，且回报优于标准基线。

Conclusion: 该设计能将离线策略转化为有清晰控制和快速适应能力的、临床医生监督的连续系统。

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险场景决策需透明可解释结果，但可解释方法可能泄露专有算法，需平衡透明度与决策解释及后续行动建议，反事实解释可满足此需求。

Method: 提出Model - Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G)框架，用基于规则的可解释替代模型近似黑盒模型，生成使原黑盒模型产生有利结果的反事实，改进成本计算，排除因因果依赖自动发生的特征变化的“努力”。

Result: MC3G比现有技术能提供更具解释性和可操作性的反事实建议，且成本更低。

Conclusion: MC3G有潜力提升包含机器学习方法的决策过程的透明度、问责性和实际效用。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia

modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试和八个竞争基线对比实验中，Meta - R1性能高，最多超现有方法27.3%；省token，token消耗降至15.7% - 32.7%，效率最多提升14.8%；可迁移，在不同数据集和模型主干上性能稳健。

Conclusion: Meta - R1框架有效解决了大推理模型缺乏元认知系统的问题，具有高性能、省token和可迁移的优点。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 现有基于符号回归或大语言模型的方法局限于单模态数据，忽视视觉现象表征，难以解释动态现象的时空模式，需新方法弥补此差距。

Method: 提出VIPER - R1模型，通过运动结构归纳课程训练，包括监督微调、因果思维链引导假设构建、奖励引导符号校准；推理时先提出符号假设，再调用外部工具进行符号残差调整；引入新数据集PhysSymbol。

Conclusion: VIPER - R1能更精确地发现物理定律。

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Result: 大语言模型在分类任务有限数据下表现强，可建立零训练基线；回归和聚类任务表现差。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为结构化数据通用预测引擎，分类有优势，回归和聚类有局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Result: 实验表明CARL在现有基准上比最先进方法多解决50%的问题。

Conclusion: CARL算法在解决约束随机最短路径问题上比现有方法更有效。

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 学习奖励破解的模型可能泛化到更有害的不对齐行为，但需更真实任务和训练方法验证。

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory

Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

Motivation: 现有金融智能体系统缺乏智能体间协调、结构化自我反思和高质量特定领域后训练数据，影响决策质量和协调能力。

Method: 设计TradingGroup系统，包含多种专业智能体，为部分智能体设计自我反思机制和动态风险管理模型，嵌入自动化数据合成和标注管道。

Result: 在五个真实世界股票数据集上的回测实验表明，TradingGroup性能优于基于规则、机器学习、强化学习和现有基于大语言模型的交易策略。

Conclusion: TradingGroup能有效解决现有系统的局限性，提高交易系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Method: 用无人机记录比赛画面获取球员位置数据，检测运动启动，用基于规则方法生成时间反事实场景，用基于足球控球的空间评估指标分析场景。

Result: 有实际传球的序列评估得分高于无传球序列；高技能组时间偏移分布更广。

Conclusion: 所提出的指标为评估无标记团队运动中的运动启动时机提供了客观手段。

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

Conclusion: AgentRAN用自然语言协调取代刚性API，重新定义未来6G网络自主解释、适应和优化行为以实现运营商目标的方式。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

Method: 将纯过去（余）安全片段的监测转化为轨迹检查，开发基于矢量化轨迹检查的GPU加速框架，利用遗传编程从历史轨迹数据学习时间属性。

Result: 框架在关键性能指标上比现有方法有2 - 10%的净提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决监测复杂度问题，且在性能上有所提升。

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

<details>

Motivation: LLM在严格逻辑或约束执行任务中表现不佳，LRM虽适合复杂推理但计算成本高、推理慢，需解决两者权衡问题。

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构推广为SOFAI - LM，用元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供迭代反馈，必要时结合LRM。

Conclusion: SOFAI - LM能使LLM在准确率上达到或超越LRM，同时保持较低推理时间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型在多智能体路径规划（MAPF）任务中表现不佳，本文提出LLM - NAR框架，结合神经算法推理器（NAR）提升性能，实验显示其优于现有基于LLM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在MAPF任务中表现欠佳，相关研究较少，而MAPF问题需规划和多智能体协调，因此要提升大语言模型在MAPF任务中的性能。

Method: 提出LLM - NAR框架，包含用于MAPF的大语言模型、基于图神经网络的预训练NAR和交叉注意力机制。

Result: 模拟和实际实验表明，该方法在解决MAPF问题上显著优于现有的基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: 首次提出用神经算法推理器将图神经网络与MAPF地图信息整合，引导大语言模型取得更好性能，且该框架可适配多种大语言模型。

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLM的移动代理难以处理个性化指令，此前研究忽视该挑战，且现有移动代理个性化能力有限。

Method: 定义个性化指令，创建PerInstruct数据集，提出PerPilot框架，通过基于记忆的检索和基于推理的探索两种方法识别个性化元素并执行指令。

Result: 实验表明PerPilot能在最少用户干预下有效处理个性化任务，且持续使用性能提升。

Conclusion: 个性化感知推理对下一代移动代理很重要。

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向，为提升大语言模型在数学规划中的能力提供结构化路线图。

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional
workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent
uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes
deep data science both accessible and actionable.

Motivation: 解决评估视觉语言模型跨表征推理一致性时因任务差异和信息不对称导致的困难。

Method: 引入SEAM基准，在四个有标准文本和视觉符号的领域进行语义等价输入配对。

Result: 21个当代模型存在系统模态不平衡，视觉表现常落后语言，跨模态一致性低，错误源于文本感知和视觉感知问题，结果对视觉变换有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SEAM为测量和改进模态无关推理提供了受控、语义等价的环境。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: 整合认知科学和机器学习的框架为LLM可解释性提供新见解，有效微调策略应利用分布式学习动态而非刚性模块化干预。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Result: 模型大小、训练量和图像类型独立且交互影响脑相似性指标，最大的DINOv3模型用最以人类为中心的图像训练时脑相似性最高；模型训练有特定时序，先与感觉皮层早期表征对齐，后与晚期和前额叶表征对齐；这一发展轨迹与人类皮层的结构和功能特性相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解架构和经验在塑造人工神经网络像人类一样看世界中的相互作用，为理解人类大脑如何表征视觉世界提供框架。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Motivation: Markov决策问题（MDPs）的折扣和平均奖励最优准则有局限性，Blackwell最优性可解决这些问题，但现有计算Blackwell最优策略的算法计算成本高或难以实现。

Method: 使用有理函数在1附近的排序来计算BO策略，将最先进算法中的数值评估替换为有理函数的符号运算以获得与位复杂度无关的边界。

Result: 为确定性MDPs给出首个强多项式时间计算BO策略的算法，为一般MDPs获得首个亚指数时间算法，推广了多个策略迭代算法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了计算Blackwell最优策略的难题，拓展了现有算法的边界。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

Abstract: Topology Optimization (TO) holds the promise of designing next-generation
compact and efficient fluidic devices. However, the inherent complexity of
fluid-based TO systems, characterized by multiphysics nonlinear interactions,
poses substantial barriers to entry for researchers.
  Beyond the inherent intricacies of forward simulation models, design
optimization is further complicated by the difficulty of computing
sensitivities, i.e., gradients. Manual derivation and implementation of
sensitivities are often laborious and prone to errors, particularly for
non-trivial objectives, constraints, and material models. An alternative
solution is automatic differentiation (AD). Although AD has been previously
demonstrated for simpler TO problems, extending its use to complex nonlinear
multiphysics systems, specifically in fluidic optimization, is key to reducing
the entry barrier.
  To this end, we introduce TOFLUX, a TO framework for fluid devices leveraging
the JAX library for high-performance automatic differentiation. The flexibility
afforded by AD enables the rapid exploration and evaluation of various
objectives and constraints. We illustrate this capability through challenging
examples encompassing thermo-fluidic coupling, fluid-structure interaction, and
non-Newtonian flows. Additionally, we demonstrate the seamless integration of
our framework with neural networks and machine learning methodologies, enabling
modern approaches to scientific computing. Ultimately, the framework aims to
provide a foundational resource to accelerate research and innovation in
fluid-based TO. The software accompanying this educational paper can be

Conclusion: 多目标优化公式统一经典和基于帕累托的方法，自适应策略在可靠性分析中表现出色。

Abstract: Reliability assessment of engineering systems is often hindered by the need
to evaluate limit-state functions through computationally expensive
simulations, rendering standard sampling impractical. An effective solution is
to approximate the limit-state function with a surrogate model iteratively
refined through active learning, thereby reducing the number of expensive
simulations. At each iteration, an acquisition strategy selects the next sample
by balancing two competing goals: exploration, to reduce global predictive
uncertainty, and exploitation, to improve accuracy near the failure boundary.
Classical strategies, such as the U-function and the Expected Feasibility
Function (EFF), implicitly condense exploration and exploitation into a scalar
score derived from the surrogate predictive mean and variance, concealing the
trade-off and biasing sampling. We introduce a multi-objective optimization
(MOO) formulation for sample acquisition in reliability analysis, where
exploration and exploitation are explicit, competing objectives. Within our
framework, U and EFF correspond to specific Pareto-optimal solutions, providing
a unifying perspective that connects classical and Pareto-based approaches.
Solving the MOO problem discards dominated candidates, yielding a compact
Pareto set, with samples representing a quantifiable exploration-exploitation
trade-off. To select samples from the Pareto set, we adopt the knee point and
the compromise solution, and further propose a strategy that adjusts the
trade-off according to reliability estimates. Across benchmark limit-state
functions, we assess the sample efficiency and active learning performance of
all strategies. Results show that U and EFF exhibit case-dependent performance,
knee and compromise are generally effective, and the adaptive strategy is
robust, consistently reaching strict targets and maintaining relative errors
below 0.1%.

Conclusion: 提出的检索-验证上下文选择框架及相关方法能有效解决宽表列标注问题，提升标注性能。

Abstract: Tables are a prevalent format for structured data, yet their metadata, such
as semantic types and column relationships, is often incomplete or ambiguous.
Column annotation tasks, including Column Type Annotation (CTA) and Column
Property Annotation (CPA), address this by leveraging table context, which are
critical for data management. Existing methods typically serialize all columns
in a table into pretrained language models to incorporate context, but this
coarse-grained approach often degrades performance in wide tables with many
irrelevant or misleading columns. To address this, we propose a novel
retrieve-and-verify context selection framework for accurate column annotation,
introducing two methods: REVEAL and REVEAL+. In REVEAL, we design an efficient
unsupervised retrieval technique to select compact, informative column contexts
by balancing semantic relevance and diversity, and develop context-aware
encoding techniques with role embeddings and target-context pair training to
effectively differentiate target and context columns. To further improve
performance, in REVEAL+, we design a verification model that refines the
selected context by directly estimating its quality for specific annotation
tasks. To achieve this, we formulate a novel column context verification
problem as a classification task and then develop the verification model.
Moreover, in REVEAL+, we develop a top-down verification inference technique to
ensure efficiency by reducing the search space for high-quality context subsets
from exponential to quadratic. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ForeSight在倾斜工作负载下吞吐量提高达2倍，在竞争下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 预测性调度显著提高了确定性数据库的可扩展性。

Abstract: Deterministic databases enable scalable replicated systems by executing
transactions in a predetermined order. However, existing designs fail to
capture transaction dependencies, leading to insufficient scheduling, high
abort rates, and poor resource utilization. By addressing these challenges with
lightweight conflict prediction and informed scheduling, we present ForeSight,
a high-performance deterministic database system. Our system has three core
improvements: (1) We design an Association Sum-Product Network to predict
potential transaction conflicts, providing the input for dependency analysis
without pre-obtained read/write sets. (2) We enhance the storage engine to
integrate multi-version-based optimization, improving the execution process and
fallback strategy to boost commit rates and concurrency. (3) We propose a
matrix two-pass forward scan algorithm that performs dependency analysis to
generate conflict-aware schedules, significantly reducing scheduling overhead.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that ForeSight achieves up to
2$\times$ higher throughput on skewed workloads and maintains strong
performance under contention, demonstrating that predictive scheduling
substantially improves deterministic database scalability.

Result: SEFRQO在CEB和Stack工作负载上相比PostgreSQL分别减少高达65.05%和93.57%的查询延迟。

Conclusion: SEFRQO能有效缓解学习型查询优化器的冷启动问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial problem in database systems that has been
studied for decades. Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance
over time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start
issues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change.
Recent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to
mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning
and execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we
present SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO
mitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from
execution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We
employ both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the
LLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints.
Moreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by
dynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the
historical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm
iteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency.
Evaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to
65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads,
respectively, compared to PostgreSQL.

specifically designed to capture vital traits of industrial NL2SQL scenarios,
providing a valuable resource for future research.

### [57] [Database Normalization via Dual-LLM Self-Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17693)
*Eunjae Jo,Nakyung Lee,Gyuyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出利用大语言模型的数据库规范化框架Miffie，可自动完成规范化且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库规范化手动操作耗时且易出错，需自动化方法。

Method: 采用双模型自优化架构，结合生成和验证模型，生成模块根据验证模块反馈消除异常，设计特定零样本提示。

Result: 实验表明Miffie能对复杂数据库模式进行规范化并保持高精度。

Conclusion: Miffie可有效实现自动化数据库规范化。

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

*Yitong Song,Pengcheng Zhang,Chao Gao,Bin Yao,Kai Wang,Zongyuan Wu,Lin Qu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 针对高维向量相似性搜索中传统方法效率低问题，提出TRIM方法，可集成到多种搜索方法中，实验显示能提升效率和剪枝率，降低I/O成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高维向量相似性搜索方法在距离计算时数据访问量大、效率低，基于三角不等式的剪枝技术在高维场景效果不佳。

Method: 提出TRIM方法，通过优化地标向量和调整三角不等式下界松弛度，可集成到基于内存和磁盘的搜索方法中。

Result: TRIM提升内存搜索方法，图搜索最高提升90%，量化搜索最高提升200%，剪枝率达99%；降低磁盘方法I/O成本最高58%，效率提升102%，保持高查询准确率。

Conclusion: TRIM能有效提高高维向量相似性搜索的效率，减少数据访问和I/O成本，且保持查询准确性。

Abstract: High-dimensional vector similarity search (HVSS) is critical for many data
processing and AI applications. However, traditional HVSS methods often require
extensive data access for distance calculations, leading to inefficiencies.
Triangle-inequality-based lower bound pruning is a widely used technique to
reduce the number of data access in low-dimensional spaces but becomes less
effective in high-dimensional settings. This is attributed to the "distance
concentration" phenomenon, where the lower bounds derived from the triangle
inequality become too small to be useful. To address this, we propose TRIM,
which enhances the effectiveness of traditional triangle-inequality-based
pruning in high-dimensional vector similarity search using two key ways: (1)
optimizing landmark vectors used to form the triangles, and (2) relaxing the
lower bounds derived from the triangle inequality, with the relaxation degree
adjustable according to user's needs. TRIM is a versatile operation that can be
seamlessly integrated into both memory-based (e.g., HNSW, IVFPQ) and disk-based
(e.g., DiskANN) HVSS methods, reducing distance calculations and disk access.
Extensive experiments show that TRIM enhances memory-based methods, improving
graph-based search by up to 90% and quantization-based search by up to 200%,
while achieving a pruning ratio of up to 99%. It also reduces I/O costs by up
to 58% and improves efficiency by 102% for disk-based methods, while preserving
high query accuracy.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出PGTuner框架用于自动调整邻近图配置，提高效率，实验显示能稳定达到顶级调优效果并显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻近图性能依赖复杂参数难优化，现有自动配置调优研究存在效率低和结果不理想问题，需高效方法确定最优配置。

Method: 提出PGTuner框架，利用预训练知识和模型迁移技术，含预训练查询性能预测模型、基于深度强化学习的参数配置推荐模型，还结合分布外检测和深度主动学习。

Result: PGTuner能在不同数据集上稳定达到顶级调优效果，显著提高调优效率，动态场景下效率提升14.64倍。

Conclusion: PGTuner是解决邻近图自动配置调优问题的有效框架，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a crucial role in many key
areas. Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the
best balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance
heavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are
difficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users
often prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal
PG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies
have explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by
inefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to
construct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the
dataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies
between configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.
  To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for
automatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model
transfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query
performance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs.
It also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration
recommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific
datasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates
out-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in
dynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across
different datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to
14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios. The code and data for PGTuner
are available online at https://github.com/hao-duan/PGTuner.

### [60] [Join Cardinality Estimation with OmniSketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17931)
*David Justen,Matthias Boehm*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出OmniSketch扩展用于多连接基数估计，实验显示在SSB - skew上有性能提升，JOB - light有局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于成本的优化器在多谓词、多连接查询中因基数估计不准确产生次优计划，现有替代方案有训练成本高、泛化性差等问题。

Method: 对OmniSketch进行扩展，引入OmniSketch连接估计器，确保跨表草图互操作性，提供处理α - 无环连接图的算法。

Result: 在SSB - skew上，中间结果最多减少1077倍，执行时间最多减少3.19倍；在JOB - light上，偶尔有个别改进，但因连接图形状不利和外键列唯一值多而有局限性。

Conclusion: OmniSketch增强的基于成本的优化能提高估计准确性和计划质量，但在某些数据集上有性能限制。

Abstract: Join ordering is a key factor in query performance, yet traditional
cost-based optimizers often produce sub-optimal plans due to inaccurate
cardinality estimates in multi-predicate, multi-join queries. Existing
alternatives such as learning-based optimizers and adaptive query processing
improve accuracy but can suffer from high training costs, poor generalization,
or integration challenges. We present an extension of OmniSketch - a
probabilistic data structure combining count-min sketches and K-minwise hashing
- to enable multi-join cardinality estimation without assuming uniformity and
independence. Our approach introduces the OmniSketch join estimator, ensures
sketch interoperability across tables, and provides an algorithm to process
alpha-acyclic join graphs. Our experiments on SSB-skew and JOB-light show that
OmniSketch-enhanced cost-based optimization can improve estimation accuracy and
plan quality compared to DuckDB. For SSB-skew, we show intermediate result
decreases up to 1,077x and execution time decreases up to 3.19x. For JOB-light,
OmniSketch join cardinality estimation shows occasional individual improvements
but largely suffers from a loss of witnesses due to unfavorable join graph
shapes and large numbers of unique values in foreign key columns.

Method: 提出硬件友好的图数据库模型Views，展示其数据结构和组织。

Result: 证明Views与传统图表示等价，通过实例展示其在语义推理和认知建模中的符号处理能力。

Conclusion: 提出了Views模型，为图数据库在硬件加速方面提供了新方案，并对未来发展给出展望。

Abstract: The graph database (GDB) is an increasingly common storage model for data
involving relationships between entries. Beyond its widespread usage in
database industries, the advantages of GDBs indicate a strong potential in
constructing symbolic artificial intelligences (AIs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), where knowledge of data inter-relationships takes a critical
role in implementation. However, current GDB models are not optimised for
hardware acceleration, leading to bottlenecks in storage capacity and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly GDB
model, called Views. We show its data structure and organisation tailored for
efficient storage and retrieval of graph data and demonstrate its equivalence
to represent traditional graph representations. We further demonstrate its
symbolic processing abilities in semantic reasoning and cognitive modelling
with practical examples and provide a short perspective on future developments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EF - Index方法存在二次预处理时间和大量冗余存储问题，而时间k - 核组件搜索问题在接触追踪、故障诊断和金融取证等任务中至关重要。

Method: 引入紧凑的以边为中心的二叉森林ECB - forest来捕获任意查询顶点随时间的k - 核，通过搜索森林中的连通分量处理查询，并开发高效的索引构建算法。

Result: 在真实世界时间图上的实验表明，该方法平均快达100倍，显著改善了索引大小和构建成本，同时保持高查询效率。

Conclusion: 提出的ECB - forest方法在处理时间k - 核组件搜索问题上优于现有方法，能有效减少索引大小和构建成本，且查询效率高。

Abstract: We study the temporal k-core component search (TCCS), which outputs the
k-core containing the query vertex in the snapshot over an arbitrary query time
window in a temporal graph. The problem has been shown to be critical for tasks
such as contact tracing, fault diagnosis, and financial forensics. The
state-of-the-art EF-Index designs a separated forest structure for a set of
carefully selected windows, incurring quadratic preprocessing time and large
redundant storage. Our method introduces the ECB-forest, a compact edge-centric
binary forest that captures k-core of any arbitrary query vertex over time. In
this way, a query can be processed by searching a connected component in the
forest. We develop an efficient algorithm for index construction. Experiments
on real-world temporal graphs show that our method significantly improves the
index size and construction cost (up to 100x faster on average) while
maintaining the high query efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估算电子显微镜丢失数据量，分析实验获取图像在同行评审科学出版物中的利用程度。

Method: 分析核心用户设施电子显微镜拍摄图像数量和随后发表在同行评审期刊中的图像数量。

Result: 数据利用效率低，超90%电子显微镜数据未使用，约2%图像发表。

Conclusion: 数据利用存在不足，但有大量数据可助力数据科学研究和人工智能项目发展，文章讨论挖掘丢失数据潜力的要点。

Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron
microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images
are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number
of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number
of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed
low efficiency of data utilization. More than 90% of electron microscopy data
generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than
150000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately
3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. Thus, the amount of
lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as >90% (in terms of data
being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one
hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy
images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of
electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the
development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the
potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.

### [64] [Performance measurements of modern Fortran MPI applications with Score-P](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16592)
*Gregor Corbin*

Main category: cs.DC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPI F08绑定广泛采用但工具支持缺乏，需增强Score - P对其支持。

Method: 在Fortran中实现MPI包装器，涵盖MPI 4.1版本，使用代码生成器依赖Python模块生成代码，且通过MPICH测试套件测试。

Result: 新F08包装器已被两个流体动力学模拟代码用于生成性能测量。

Conclusion: 成功为Score - P添加F08绑定的完整支持，介绍了设计与实现及面临的挑战。

Abstract: Version 3.0 of the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) standard, released in
2012, introduced a new set of language bindings for Fortran 2008. By making use
of modern language features and the enhanced interoperability with C, there was
finally a type safe and standard conforming method to call MPI from Fortran.
This highly recommended use mpi_f08 language binding has since then been widely
adopted among developers of modern Fortran applications. However, tool support
for the F08 bindings is still lacking almost a decade later, forcing users to
recede to the less safe and convenient interfaces. Full support for the F08
bindings was added to the performance measurement infrastructure Score-P by
implementing MPI wrappers in Fortran. Wrappers cover the latest MPI standard
version 4.1 in its entirety, matching the features of the C wrappers. By
implementing the wrappers in modern Fortran, we can provide full support for
MPI procedures passing attributes, info objects, or callbacks. The
implementation is regularly tested under the MPICH test suite. The new F08
wrappers were already used by two fluid dynamics simulation codes -- Neko, a
spectral finite-element code derived from Nek5000, and EPIC (Elliptical
Parcel-In-Cell) -- to successfully generate performance measurements. In this
work, we additionally present our design considerations and sketch out the
implementation, discussing the challenges we faced in the process. The key
component of the implementation is a code generator that produces approximately
50k lines of MPI wrapper code to be used by Score-P, relying on the Python
pympistandard module to provide programmatic access to the extracted data from
the MPI standard.

Motivation: 传统单线程ESCG模拟计算成本高且扩展性差，需高性能实现。

Method: 使用Apple的Metal和Nvidia的CUDA开发高性能实现，以单线程C++版本为基线对比。

Result: GPU加速显著提升速度，CUDA maxStep实现最高达28倍加速，可处理更大系统规模，但Metal有扩展性限制，还能复制和扩展近期ESCG研究。

Conclusion: 项目提供可配置ESCG模拟平台，推动该领域计算工具发展。

Abstract: This dissertation presents the design, implementation and evaluation of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks for Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games
(ESCGs), a class of agent-based models used to study ecological and
evolutionary dynamics. Traditional single-threaded ESCG simulations are
computationally expensive and scale poorly. To address this, high-performance
implementations were developed using Apple's Metal and Nvidia's CUDA, with a
validated single-threaded C++ version serving as a baseline comparison point.
  Benchmarking results show that GPU acceleration delivers significant
speedups, with the CUDA maxStep implementation achieving up to a 28x
improvement. Larger system sizes, up to 3200x3200, became tractable, while
Metal faced scalability limits. The GPU frameworks also enabled replication and
critical extension of recent ESCG studies, revealing sensitivities to system
size and runtime not fully explored in prior work.
  Overall, this project provides a configurable ESCG simulation platform that
advances the computational toolkit for this field of research. This
dissertation forms the basis for a paper accepted for publication and
presentation at the European Modelling and Simulation Symposium.

TL;DR: 提出双计数器框架解决LLM服务局限，引入MoPE预测指标以计算整体公平性分数，实现公平调度，Equinox系统评估表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型（LLM）服务的局限性。

Method: 采用双计数器框架，分离用户和运营者视角；引入确定性的混合预测专家（MoPE）框架进行指标预测；实现Equinox系统并采用自适应批处理和无停顿调度等优化。

Result: 在生产跟踪和合成工作负载上评估，Equinox比VTC实现了高达1.3倍的吞吐量、60%的首次令牌延迟降低、13%的公平性提升，同时保持94%的GPU利用率。

Conclusion: 证明了在异构平台上有界差异下的公平性。

Abstract: We address the limitations of current LLM serving with a dual-counter
framework separating user and operator perspectives. The User Fairness Counter
measures quality of service via weighted tokens and latency; the Resource
Fairness Counter measures operational efficiency through throughput and GPU
utilization. Since these metrics are only available post-execution, creating a
scheduling paradox, we introduce a deterministic Mixture of Prediction Experts
(MoPE) framework to predict user-perceived latency, output tokens, throughput,
and GPU utilization. These predictions enable calculation of a unified Holistic
Fairness score that balances both counters through tunable parameters for
proactive fairness-aware scheduling. We implement this in Equinox, an
open-source system with other optimizations like adaptive batching, and
stall-free scheduling. Evaluations on production traces (ShareGPT, LMSYS) and
synthetic workloads demonstrate Equinox achieves up to $1.3\times$ higher
throughput, 60\% lower time-to-first-token latency, and 13\% higher fairness
versus VTC while maintaining 94\% GPU utilization, proving fairness under
bounded discrepancy across heterogeneous platforms.

Conclusion: 可扩展的神经形态平台有能力实现和加速生物现实模型。

Abstract: We demonstrate the first-ever nontrivial, biologically realistic connectome
simulated on neuromorphic computing hardware. Specifically, we implement the
whole-brain connectome of the adult Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) from
the FlyWire Consortium containing 140K neurons and 50M synapses on the Intel
Loihi 2 neuromorphic platform. This task is particularly challenging due to the
characteristic connectivity structure of biological networks. Unlike artificial
neural networks and most abstracted neural models, real biological circuits
exhibit sparse, recurrent, and irregular connectivity that is poorly suited to
conventional computing methods intended for dense linear algebra. Though
neuromorphic hardware is architecturally better suited to discrete event-based
biological communication, mapping the connectivity structure to frontier
systems still faces challenges from low-level hardware constraints, such as
fan-in and fan-out memory limitations. We describe solutions to these
challenges that allow for the full FlyWire connectome to fit onto 12 Loihi 2
chips. We statistically validate our implementation by comparing network
behavior across multiple reference simulations. Significantly, we achieve a
neuromorphic implementation that is orders of magnitude faster than numerical
simulations on conventional hardware, and we also find that performance
advantages increase with sparser activity. These results affirm that today's
scalable neuromorphic platforms are capable of implementing and accelerating
biologically realistic models -- a key enabling technology for advancing
neuro-inspired AI and computational neuroscience.

Motivation: 在保持编程效率的同时，实现垂直、水平和时间维度的可扩展性能，需要有效抽象，分布式数组是这样一种抽象。

Method: 使用STREAM内存带宽基准测试，在多种硬件上探索分布式数组性能。

Result: 在CPU核心、CPU节点和GPU节点内及跨节点展示了可扩展性能，跨多节点水平扩展呈线性；对比不同时期硬件，显示内存带宽有显著提升；在数百个MIT SuperCloud节点同时运行达到持续带宽>1 PB/s。

Conclusion: 分布式数组这种抽象能使高级编程实现高度可扩展性能，且通过数据局部性获得高内存带宽效率。

Abstract: High level programming languages and GPU accelerators are powerful enablers
for a wide range of applications. Achieving scalable vertical (within a compute
node), horizontal (across compute nodes), and temporal (over different
generations of hardware) performance while retaining productivity requires
effective abstractions. Distributed arrays are one such abstraction that
enables high level programming to achieve highly scalable performance.
Distributed arrays achieve this performance by deriving parallelism from data
locality, which naturally leads to high memory bandwidth efficiency. This paper
explores distributed array performance using the STREAM memory bandwidth
benchmark on a variety of hardware. Scalable performance is demonstrated within
and across CPU cores, CPU nodes, and GPU nodes. Horizontal scaling across
multiple nodes was linear. The hardware used spans decades and allows a direct
comparison of hardware improvements for memory bandwidth over this time range;
showing a 10x increase in CPU core bandwidth over 20 years, 100x increase in
CPU node bandwidth over 20 years, and 5x increase in GPU node bandwidth over 5
years. Running on hundreds of MIT SuperCloud nodes simultaneously achieved a
sustained bandwidth $>$1 PB/s.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦微调高内存成本限制资源受限设备参与，需要解决内存成本问题。

Method: 采用宏 - 微协同剪枝框架，宏观层面有功能驱动的层编排机制，微观层面有重要性感知的层选择策略；还有细粒度变体独立剪枝多头注意力和前馈网络组件。

Result: FedPruner显著优于现有方法，平均模型准确率最高提升1.98%，峰值内存使用降低75%。

Conclusion: FedPruner是有效的解决联邦微调高内存成本问题的方法。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving Large Language Model (LLM)
adaptation, but its high memory cost limits participation from
resource-constrained devices. We propose FedPruner, an innovative federated
fine-tuning paradigm that tackles this via intelligent layer pruning. FedPruner
flexibly prunes the global model, creating personalized submodels based on
device memory constraints. It employs a macro-micro synergistic pruning
framework: a macro-level functionality-driven layer orchestration mechanism
groups layers, while a micro-level importance-aware layer selection strategy
prunes within groups to build device-specific submodels. We further introduce a
fine-grained variant that independently prunes Multi-Head Attention and
Feed-Forward Network components to precisely preserve critical architectural
elements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedPruner
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to a 1.98\%
improvement in average model accuracy while reducing peak memory usage by 75\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前缀缓存系统与请求调度紧密耦合，存在负载不均衡、数据冗余和内存碎片化问题，且无法实现低延迟内存池化。

Method: 提出TokenLake，使用声明式缓存接口，采用重负载感知的负载均衡算法管理段级前缀缓存，透明减少查询张量和新缓存的通信量。

Result: 在实际工作负载评估中，与现有解决方案相比，TokenLake可将吞吐量分别提高2.6倍和2.0倍，命中率分别提高2.0倍和2.1倍。

Conclusion: TokenLake能有效解决现有前缀缓存系统问题，提升缓存性能。

Abstract: Prefix caching is crucial to accelerate multi-turn interactions and requests
with shared prefixes. At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are
tightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and
computation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy,
and memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these
issues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying
cache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However,
because existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer
prefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory
pooling.
  To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache
pool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests'
query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for
efficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix
cache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm
to achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation.
TokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query
tensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests
elastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache
management. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve
throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 2.0$\times$ and boost hit rate by
2.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing
and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.

Abstract: Communication locality plays a key role in the performance of collective
operations on large HPC systems, especially on oversubscribed networks where
groups of nodes are fully connected internally but sparsely linked through
global connections. We present Bine (binomial negabinary) trees, a family of
collective algorithms that improve communication locality. Bine trees maintain
the generality of binomial trees and butterflies while cutting global-link
traffic by up to 33%. We implement eight Bine-based collectives and evaluate
them on four large-scale supercomputers with Dragonfly, Dragonfly+,
oversubscribed fat-tree, and torus topologies, achieving up to 5x speedups and
consistent reductions in global-link traffic across different vector sizes and

Conclusion: Zen - Attention框架能有效优化DRAM带宽利用，增强映射能力，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models are increasingly deployed on energy,
and DRAM bandwidth constrained devices such as laptops and gaming consoles,
which presents significant challenges in meeting the latency requirements of
the models. The industry is turning to neural processing units (NPUs) for
superior performance-per-watt (perf/watt); however, efficiently mapping dynamic
attention layers to the NPUs remains a challenging task. For optimizing
perf/watt, AMD XDNA NPUs employ software managed caches and share system memory
with host. This requires substantial engineering effort to unlock efficient
tiling, buffer allocation, and data movement to extract the maximum efficiency
from the device. This paper introduces Zen-Attention, a framework that
optimizes DRAM bandwidth utilization in the attention layer of models by
systematically exploring the complex design space of layer folding, tiling, and
data-movement on the interconnect, and the tensor layouts to come up with an
optimal solution. Our evaluation includes comparative analysis of end-to-end
model latency and specific attention latency in each model. We demonstrate how
the framework enhances mapping capabilities by varying input dimensions, which
require padding and masking in the attention block. For representative
transformer models, the Zen-Attention Framework achieves up to 4x improvement
in the latency of the attention block and up to 32% improvement in end-to-end
network latency compared to the baseline Unfolded- approaches.

Motivation: ESFT微调后的模型大规模服务存在挑战，现有多适配器服务系统与ESFT范式不兼容。

Method: 引入虚拟内存辅助的专家权重管理器和批量重路由的融合内核。

Result: 可在单加速器上服务多个适配器，提供更多KV缓存容量、更高吞吐量，不影响模型精度，扩展到20个适配器时开销低。

Conclusion: ExpertWeave能有效解决ESFT模型服务的资源问题，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning (ESFT) adapts Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large
language models to enhance their task-specific performance by selectively
tuning the top-activated experts for the task. Serving these fine-tuned models
at scale is challenging: deploying merged models in isolation is prohibitively
resource-hungry, while existing multi-adapter serving systems with LoRA-style
additive updates are incompatible with ESFT's expert-oriented paradigm. We
present ExpertWeave, a system that serves multiple ESFT adapters concurrently
over a single shared MoE base model, drastically reducing the memory footprint
and improving resource utilization. To seamlessly integrate into existing
inference pipelines for MoE models with non-intrusive modifications and minimal
latency overhead, ExpertWeave introduces a virtual-memory-assisted expert
weight manager that co-locates base-model and adapter experts without incurring
memory overhead from fragmentation, and a fused kernel for batched rerouting to
enable lightweight redirection of tokens to the appropriate experts at runtime.
Our evaluations show that ExpertWeave can simultaneously serve multiple
adapters of a 16B MoE model on a single accelerator where the baseline runs out
of memory, or provides up to 94x more KV cache capacity and achieves up to 18%
higher throughput while using comparable resources, all without compromising
model accuracy. ExpertWeave maintains low overhead even when scaling to 20
adapters, with a 4-11% latency increase compared with serving the base model
alone. Source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 所提架构为大规模HPC基础设施上的LLM推理提供更高效、响应快和容错的方法。

Abstract: This work elaborates on a High performance computing (HPC) architecture based
on Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) [1] for deploying
heterogeneous Large Language Models (LLMs) into a scalable inference engine.
Dynamic resource scheduling and seamless integration of containerized
microservices have been leveraged herein to manage CPU, GPU, and memory
allocations efficiently in multi-node clusters. Extensive experiments, using
Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe
throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up
to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models,
saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more
than 2 seconds. This architecture includes Representational State Transfer
Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs) [4] endpoints for single and
bulk inferences, as well as advanced workflows such as multi-step "tribunal"
refinement. Experimental results confirm minimal overhead from container and
scheduling activities and show that the approach scales reliably both for batch
and interactive settings. We further illustrate real-world scenarios, including
the deployment of chatbots with retrievalaugmented generation, which helps to
demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the architecture. The obtained
results pave ways for significantly more efficient, responsive, and
fault-tolerant LLM inference on large-scale HPC infrastructures.

Result: 实现无等待最终一致性复制状态机，保证所有副本有共同单调增长的稳定操作前缀，无客户端饥饿。

Conclusion: 基于DAG框架和协调函数可有效解决无等待数据复制的挑战。

Abstract: Replication is a standard way to maintain availability of shared data in
fault-prone distributed systems. To make sure that the data replicas are
up-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the
replicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of
waiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the
system. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of
replicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the
replicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be
implemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility
is to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge
to the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients
can get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.
  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the
operations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects
can be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency. Second, even if
some operations eventually stabilize in their effects, a particular client may
still experience starvation if, from some point onward, each of its operations
is later revoked. In this paper, we address these challenges through a general
DAG-based framework for replicated data types, where replicas exchange their
local views and merge them using a reconciliation function. Within this
framework, we design reconciliation functions that implement a wait-free
eventually consistent replicated state machine ensuring both stable convergence
and fair progress. Specifically, every replica maintains a growing sequence of
client operations, and we guarantee that: (1) all replicas share a common,
monotonically growing stable prefix of operations, and (2) no client starves.

Motivation: NSA的内核实现依赖查询分组策略，仅在大GQA尺寸下高效，现代LLMs多采用小GQA组，限制了NSA算法的应用。

Method: 提出FSA，采用替代内核设计，可在现代GPU上对不同小GQA组大小的流行LLMs进行高效NSA计算。

Result: 与普通NSA内核实现相比，FSA实现了最高3.5倍、平均1.6倍的内核级延迟降低；最高1.25倍、平均1.09倍的端到端训练加速；最高1.36倍、平均1.11倍的端到端预填充加速。

Conclusion: FSA解决了NSA在小GQA组大小下的适用性问题，有明显性能提升，代码开源可推动相关研究。

Abstract: Recent progress in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong
potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and
inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), a
state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned
sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance gains while
maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel
implementation of NSA relies on a query-grouping strategy that is efficient
only with large Grouped Query Attention (GQA) sizes, whereas modern LLMs
typically adopt much smaller GQA groups, which limits the applicability of this
sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention
(FSA), which includes an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA
computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group
sizes on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5$\times$ and
on average 1.6$\times$ kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25$\times$
and 1.09$\times$ on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art
LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36$\times$ and 1.11$\times$ on average end-to-end
prefill speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is open-sourced and

Abstract: Property testers are fast, randomized "election polling"-type algorithms that
determine if an input (e.g., graph or hypergraph) has a certain property or is
$\varepsilon$-far from the property. In the dense graph model of property
testing, it is known that many properties can be tested with query complexity
that depends only on the error parameter $\varepsilon$ (and not on the size of
the input), but the current bounds on the query complexity grow extremely
quickly as a function of $1/\varepsilon$. Which properties can be tested
efficiently, i.e., with $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ queries? This survey
presents the state of knowledge on this general question, as well as some key
open problems.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the complexity of building, given a two-dimensional string of size
$n$, an indexing structure that allows locating all $k$ occurrences of a
two-dimensional pattern of size $m$. While a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(n)$
with query time $\mathcal{O}(m+k)$ is known for this problem under the
additional assumption that the pattern is a square [Giancarlo, SICOMP 1995], a
popular belief was that for rectangular patterns one cannot achieve such (or
even similar) bounds, due to a lower bound for a certain natural class of
approaches [Giancarlo, WADS 1993]. We show that, in fact, it is possible to
construct a very simple structure of size $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ that supports
such queries for any rectangular pattern in
$\mathcal{O}(m+k\log^{\varepsilon}n)$ time, for any $\varepsilon>0$. Further,
our structure can be constructed in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$ time.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of minimizing the total flow time of jobs on
a single machine in the online setting where jobs arrive over time. It has long
been known that the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm is
optimal (i.e., $1$-competitive) when the job sizes are known up-front [Schrage,
1968]. But in the non-clairvoyant setting where job sizes are revealed only
when the job finishes, no algorithm can be constant-competitive [Motwani,
Phillips, and Torng, 1994].
  We consider the $\varepsilon$-clairvoyant setting, where $\varepsilon \in
[0,1]$, and each job's processing time becomes known once its remaining
processing time equals an $\varepsilon$ fraction of its processing time. This
captures settings where the system user uses the initial $(1-\varepsilon)$
fraction of a job's processing time to learn its true length, which it can then
reveal to the algorithm. The model was proposed by Yingchareonthawornchai and
Torng (2017), and it smoothly interpolates between the clairvoyant setting
(when $\epsilon = 1$) and the non-clairvoyant setting (when $\varepsilon = 0$).
In a concrete sense, we are asking: how much knowledge is required to
circumvent the hardness of this problem?
  We show that a little knowledge is enough, and that a constant competitive
algorithm exists for every constant $\varepsilon > 0$. More precisely, for all
$\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, we present a deterministic $\smash{\lceil
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\rceil}$-competitive algorithm, which is optimal for
deterministic algorithms. We also present a matching lower bound (up to a
constant factor) for randomized algorithms. Our algorithm to achieve this bound
is remarkably simple and applies the ``optimism in the face of uncertainty''
principle. The proof relies on maintaining a matching between the jobs in the
optimum's queue and the algorithm's queue, with small prefix expansion.

Motivation: 探索经典PUSH&PULL谣言传播过程的加速方法，研究多调用变体的性能。

Method: 理论分析和证明，研究多调用变体在完全图和小集顶点扩张图上的传播轮数。

Result: 完全图上，k - PUSH&PULL变体以高概率在Θ(logₖ n)轮完成；小集顶点扩张图上，以高概率在O(logₚ n · logₖ n)轮完成，有Ω(logₚ n + logₖ n)轮的下界。

Conclusion: 多调用的PUSH&PULL变体可加快谣言传播，但会增加节点间通信量，小集顶点扩张图适合快速信息传播。

Abstract: We study a multi-call variant of the classic PUSH&PULL rumor spreading
process where nodes can contact $k$ of their neighbors instead of a single one
during both PUSH and PULL operations. We show that rumor spreading can be made
faster at the cost of an increased amount of communication between the nodes.
As a motivating example, consider the process on a complete graph of $n$ nodes:
while the standard PUSH&PULL protocol takes $\Theta(\log n)$ rounds, we prove
that our $k$-PUSH&PULL variant completes in $\Theta(\log_{k} n)$ rounds, with
high probability.
  We generalize this result in an expansion-sensitive way, as has been done for
the classic PUSH&PULL protocol for different notions of expansion, e.g.,
conductance and vertex expansion. We consider small-set vertex expanders,
graphs in which every sufficiently small subset of nodes has a large
neighborhood, ensuring strong local connectivity. In particular, when the
expansion parameter satisfies $\phi > 1$, these graphs have a diameter of
$o(\log n)$, as opposed to other standard notions of expansion. Since the
graph's diameter is a lower bound on the number of rounds required for rumor
spreading, this makes small-set expanders particularly well-suited for fast
information dissemination. We prove that $k$-PUSH&PULL takes $O(\log_{\phi} n
\cdot \log_{k} n)$ rounds in these expanders, with high probability. We
complement this with a simple lower bound of $\Omega(\log_{\phi} n+ \log_{k}
n)$ rounds.

Abstract: We study the problem of strongly refuting semirandom $k$-LIN$(\mathbb{F})$
instances: systems of $k$-sparse inhomogeneous linear equations over a finite
field $\mathbb{F}$. For the case of $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{F}_2$, this is the
well-studied problem of refuting semirandom instances of $k$-XOR, where the
works of [GKM22,HKM23] establish a tight trade-off between runtime and clause
density for refutation: for any choice of a parameter $\ell$, they give an
$n^{O(\ell)}$-time algorithm to certify that there is no assignment that can
satisfy more than $\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon$-fraction of constraints in a
semirandom $k$-XOR instance, provided that the instance has $O(n) \cdot
\left(\frac{n}{\ell}\right)^{k/2 - 1} \log n /\varepsilon^4$ constraints, and
the work of [KMOW17] provides good evidence that this tight up to a
$\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor via lower bounds for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy.
However for larger fields, the only known results for this problem are
established via black-box reductions to the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$, resulting
in an $|{\mathbb{F}}|^{3k}$ gap between the current best upper and lower
bounds.
  In this paper, we give an algorithm for refuting semirandom
$k$-LIN$(\mathbb{F})$ instances with the "correct" dependence on the field size
$|{\mathbb{F}}|$. For any choice of a parameter $\ell$, our algorithm runs in
$(|{\mathbb{F}}|n)^{O(\ell)}$-time and strongly refutes semirandom
$k$-LIN$(\mathbb{F})$ instances with at least $O(n) \cdot
\left(\frac{|{\mathbb{F}^*}| n}{\ell}\right)^{k/2 - 1} \log(n |{\mathbb{F}^*}|)
/\varepsilon^4$ constraints. We give good evidence that this dependence on the
field size $|{\mathbb{F}}|$ is optimal by proving a lower bound for the
Sum-of-Squares hierarchy that matches this threshold up to a
$\mathrm{polylog}(n |{\mathbb{F}^*}|)$ factor. Our results also extend to the
more general case of finite Abelian groups.

Conclusion: ParDS是精确解决MDS问题的先进方案。

Abstract: The Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem is a well-established combinatorial
optimization problem with numerous real-world applications. Its NP-hard nature
makes it increasingly difficult to obtain exact solutions as the graph size
grows. This paper introduces ParDS, an exact algorithm developed to address the
MDS problem within the branch-and-bound framework. ParDS features two key
innovations: an advanced linear programming technique that yields tighter lower
bounds and a set of novel reduction rules that dynamically simplify instances
throughout the solving process. Compared to the leading exact algorithms
presented at IJCAI 2023 and 2024, ParDS demonstrates theoretically superior
lower-bound quality. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets
highlight several significant advantages of ParDS: it achieves fastest solving
times in 70% of graph categories, especially on large, sparse graphs, delivers
a speed-up of up to 3,411 times on the fastest individual instance, and
successfully solves 16 out of 43 instances that other algorithms were unable to
resolve within the 5-hour time limit. These findings establish ParDS as a
state-of-the-art solution for exactly solving the MDS problem.

Abstract: The rise of auto-bidding has created challenges for ensuring advertiser
incentive compatibility, particularly when advertisers delegate bidding to
agents with high-level constraints. One challenge in defining incentive
compatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit
reports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a
range of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion
of Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that
auctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their
definition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome
of an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome
of any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both
First-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC
definition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints
that the advertiser can report.
  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse
Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding
Incentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting
is preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than
the least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This
distinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for
advertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We
demonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that
SPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to
employ uniform bidding. These findings provide new insights into the incentive
properties of SPA in auto-bidding environments, particularly when considering
advertisers' perspectives on equilibrium selection.

TL;DR: 本文研究用户如何应对个性化定价管理社交活动，以及卖家如何调整定价策略，通过动态贝叶斯博弈分析得出唯一完美贝叶斯均衡，发现提升用户隐私意识的监管可能降低用户收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用户画像技术受隐私增强技术影响，卖家转向社交网络进行用户画像，需研究用户应对个性化定价的社交活动管理和卖家定价策略调整。

Method: 构建卖家和用户之间在信息不对称下的动态贝叶斯博弈，交替使用反向和正向归纳法解决分析难题。

Result: 随着画像技术准确性提高，卖家倾向提高统一价格激励用户社交活动以促进画像，但实施知情同意政策后多数用户收益变差。

Conclusion: 近期提升用户隐私意识的监管演变可能产生降低用户收益的意外后果。

Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase
records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer
personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to
non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies
has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online
sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to
better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper
presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their
social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller
should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in
social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller
and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this
game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well
as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure
consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under
random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying
backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique
perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as
the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the
equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and
facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off
after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data
access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that
recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have
unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.

Abstract: Given a set of items and a set of evaluators who all individually rank them,
how do we aggregate these evaluations into a single societal ranking? Work in
social choice and statistics has produced many aggregation methods for this
problem, each with its desirable properties, but also with its limitations.
Further, existing impossibility results rule out designing a single method that
achieves every property of interest. Faced with this trade-off between
incompatible desiderata, how do we decide which aggregation rule to use, i.e.,
what is a good rule picking rule?
  In this paper, we formally address this question by introducing a novel
framework for rule picking rules (RPRs). We then design a data-driven RPR that
identifies the best aggregation method for each specific setting, without
assuming any generative model. The principle behind our RPR is to pick the rule
which maximizes the consistency of the output ranking if the data collection
process were repeated. We introduce several consistency-related axioms for RPRs
and show that our method satisfies them, including those failed by a wide class
of natural RPRs. While we prove that the algorithmic problem of maximizing
consistency is computationally hard, we provide a sampling-based implementation
of our RPR that is efficient in practice. We run this implementation on known
statistical models and find that, when possible, our method selects the maximum
likelihood estimator of the data. Finally, we show that our RPR can be used in
many real-world settings to gain insights about how the rule currently being
used can be modified or replaced to substantially improve the consistency of
the process.
  Taken together, our work bridges an important gap between the axiomatic and
statistical approaches to rank aggregation, laying a robust theoretical and
computational foundation for principled rule picking.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型在研究个体决策方面有独特结果，能反映更多情况。

Abstract: We present a Stackelberg game model to investigate how individuals make their
decisions on timing and route selection. Group formation can naturally result
from these decisions, but only when individuals arrive at the same time and
choose the same route. Although motivated by bird migration, our model applies
to scenarios such as traffic planning, disaster evacuation, and other animal
movements. Early arrivals secure better territories, while traveling together
enhances navigation accuracy, foraging efficiency, and energy efficiency.
Longer or more difficult migration routes reduce predation risks but increase
travel costs, such as higher elevations and scarce food resources. Our analysis
reveals a richer set of subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs) and heightened
competition, compared to earlier models focused only on timing. By
incorporating individual differences in travel costs, our model introduces a
"neutrality" state in addition to "cooperation" and "competition."

Abstract: We introduce a model for collaborative text aggregation in which an agent
community coauthors a document, modeled as an unordered collection of
paragraphs, using a dynamic mechanism: agents propose paragraphs and vote on
those suggested by others. We formalize the setting and explore its
realizations, concentrating on voting mechanisms that aggregate votes into a
single, dynamic document. We focus on two desiderata: the eventual stability of
the process and its expected social welfare. Following an impossibility result,
we describe several aggregation methods and report on agent-based simulations
that utilize natural language processing (NLP) and large-language models (LLMs)
to model agents and their contexts. Using these simulations, we demonstrate
promising results regarding the possibility of rapid convergence to a high
social welfare collaborative text.

Abstract: Many game-theoretic models assume that players have access to accurate
information, but uncertainty in observed data is frequently present in
real-world settings. In this paper, we consider a model of uncertainty where
adversarial perturbations of relative magnitude $1+\varepsilon$ are introduced
to players' observed costs. The effect of uncertainty on social cost is denoted
as the price of uncertainty. We prove a tight bound on the price of uncertainty
for consensus games of $\Theta(\varepsilon^2 n^2)$ for all $\varepsilon =
\Omega\mathopen{}\left(n^{-1/4}\right)$. This improves a previous lower bound
of $\Omega(\varepsilon^3 n^2)$ as well as a previous upper bound of
$O(\varepsilon n^2)$.

Result: 新算法在给定游戏观察和可能的额外历史数据时，能有效收敛到对手真实策略。

Conclusion: 新算法能弥补现有对手建模方法的不足，可高效收敛到对手真实策略。

Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward
against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic
solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in
some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and
observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent
modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal
opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such
approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show
that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable
property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution;
namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true
strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches
infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and
runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the
sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The
algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy
given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it
is available.

Result: 在真实预测数据集上实证表明，WOMAC比标准机制更能可靠预测专家样本外表现。

Conclusion: WOMAC在结果/标签有大量噪声的竞赛中有用。

Abstract: Competitions are widely used to identify top performers in judgmental
forecasting and machine learning, and the standard competition design ranks
competitors based on their cumulative scores against a set of realized outcomes
or held-out labels. However, this standard design is neither
incentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is
noise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker
competitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes
misreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.
Attempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that
add even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism
and practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel
deterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of
scoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts
against the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy
outcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in
typical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging
to analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to
justify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation
and demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a
more reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the
standard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is
substantial noise in the outcomes/labels.

Abstract: In this work, we model Moving Target Defence (MTD) as a partially observable
stochastic game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker tries to
compromise the system through probing actions, while the defender minimizes the
risk by reimaging the system, balancing between performance cost and security
level. We demonstrate that the optimal strategies for both players follow a
threshold structure. Based on this insight, we propose a structure-aware policy
gradient reinforcement learning algorithm that helps both players converge to
the Nash equilibrium. This approach enhances the defender's ability to adapt
and effectively counter evolving threats, improving the overall security of the
system. Finally, we validate the proposed method through numerical simulations.

Abstract: User-to-item retrieval has been an active research area in recommendation
system, and two tower models are widely adopted due to model simplicity and
serving efficiency. In this work, we focus on a variant called
\textit{conditional retrieval}, where we expect retrieved items to be relevant
to a condition (e.g. topic). We propose a method that uses the same training
data as standard two tower models but incorporates item-side information as
conditions in query. This allows us to bootstrap new conditional retrieval use
cases and encourages feature interactions between user and condition.
Experiments show that our method can retrieve highly relevant items and
outperforms standard two tower models with filters on engagement metrics. The
proposed model is deployed to power a topic-based notification feed at
Pinterest and led to +0.26\% weekly active users.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems heavily leverage user interaction data to deliver
personalized experiences. However, relying on personal data presents challenges
in adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's "right to be forgotten".
Machine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the
efficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without
compromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current
benchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec --
fail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on
collaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket
recommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore
critical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design
desiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic
benchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering
feedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple
recommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and
several unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS
unlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that
reflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests.
We also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation
setting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works
for sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning
requests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed
unlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning
algorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of
only several seconds.

Conclusion: 通过深入消融研究确认各组件贡献，定性分析表明模型在现实场景中具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded
information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from
complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most
documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate
silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or
languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective
framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal
pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers
that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from
multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token
level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on
out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual
settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We
confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies,
and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's
robustness in real world settings.

Motivation: 现有超长用户行为序列建模方法无法在低损耗压缩、上下文感知和效率间取得良好平衡。

Result: 在三个大规模数据集上，VQL始终优于强基线模型，提高了准确性并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: VQL在超长序列推荐的准确性和效率平衡上达到新的最优水平。

Abstract: In large-scale recommender systems, ultra-long user behavior sequences encode
rich signals of evolving interests. Extending sequence length generally
improves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is
infeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into
two categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may
discard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression,
which preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key
context such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a
good balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.
  We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for
ultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only
quantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we
prove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence
length, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also
enables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization:
attention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook,
which reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient
context injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly
integrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel.
All context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached
representations remain query-independent.
  Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show
that VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy
while reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in
balancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.

Abstract: Popularity bias is a well-known challenge in recommender systems, where a
small number of popular items receive disproportionate attention, while the
majority of less popular items are largely overlooked. This imbalance often
results in reduced recommendation quality and unfair exposure of items.
Although existing mitigation techniques address this bias to some extent, they
typically lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a
post-hoc method using a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to interpret and mitigate
popularity bias in deep recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate
a pre-trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By
introducing synthetic users with clear preferences for either popular or
unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals based on their
activation patterns. We then adjust the activations of the most biased neurons
to steer recommendations toward fairer exposure. Experiments on two public
datasets using a sequential recommendation model show that our method
significantly improves fairness with minimal impact on accuracy. Moreover, it
offers interpretability and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Serendipity in recommender systems (RSs) has attracted increasing attention
as a concept that enhances user satisfaction by presenting unexpected and
useful items. However, evaluating serendipitous performance remains challenging
because its ground truth is generally unobservable. The existing offline
metrics often depend on ambiguous definitions or are tailored to specific
datasets and RSs, thereby limiting their generalizability. To address this
issue, we propose a universally applicable evaluation framework that leverages
large language models (LLMs) known for their extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, as evaluators. First, to improve the evaluation performance of
the proposed framework, we assessed the serendipity prediction accuracy of LLMs
using four different prompt strategies on a dataset containing user-annotated
serendipitous ground truth and found that the chain-of-thought prompt achieved
the highest accuracy. Next, we re-evaluated the serendipitous performance of
both serendipity-oriented and general RSs using the proposed framework on three
commonly used real-world datasets, without the ground truth. The results
indicated that there was no serendipity-oriented RS that consistently
outperformed across all datasets, and even a general RS sometimes achieved
higher performance than the serendipity-oriented RS.

Conclusion: FlowRec是一个简单有效的序列推荐框架，能解决现有扩散模型的局限。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their
historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted
significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user
interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising
Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models
face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the
condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian
noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting
practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet
effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to
explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future
interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers
greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient
sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior
distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user
preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation
objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both
positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation
quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the
superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to diversify queries in existing test
collections to reflect some of the diversity of search engine users, aligning
with an earlier vision of an 'ideal' test collection. A Large Language Model
(LLM) is used to create query variants: alternative queries that have the same
meaning as the original. These variants represent user profiles characterised
by different properties, such as language and domain proficiency, which are
known in the IR literature to influence query formulation.
  The LLM's ability to generate query variants that align with user profiles is
empirically validated, and the variants' utility is further explored for IR
system evaluation. Results demonstrate that the variants impact how systems are
ranked and show that user profiles experience significantly different levels of
system effectiveness. This method enables an alternative perspective on system
evaluation where we can observe both the impact of user profiles on system
rankings and how system performance varies across users.

Abstract: As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the
Internet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of
distinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated
texts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential
inclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers
like BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the
influence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are
valued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our
linguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother
high-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity,
and greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being
trained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions.
Our study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate
source bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term
distributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than
displaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for
understanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing
mixed-source content.

Motivation: 现有个性化搜索排序系统未充分利用用户实时意图与过去行为的明确对齐。

Method: 将兴趣提取设为条件去噪任务，用用户查询引导扩散过程，提出用户感知去噪层（UDL）。

Result: 通过大量离线和在线实验，证明DiffusionGS比现有方法更优。

Conclusion: DiffusionGS通过将查询作为意图先验并利用基于扩散的去噪，能有效捕捉用户动态兴趣变化。

Abstract: Personalized search ranking systems are critical for driving engagement and
revenue in modern e-commerce and short-video platforms. While existing methods
excel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical
behaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's
real-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In
this paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by
generative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit
intent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from
long-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest
extraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a
conditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware
representation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware
Denoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the
optimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing
queries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method
provides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.
Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of
DiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LexSemBridge能有效增强稠密查询表示，解决细粒度检索问题，且具有通用性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large
language models (LLMs) become increasingly complex and diverse, dense retrieval
models have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless,
they often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword
alignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high
lexical overlap that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To
systematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks,
keyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical
fine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose
LexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations
through fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs
latent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical
(SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense
embeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this
modulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying
discriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying
the backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities.
Extensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate
the effectiveness and generality of our approach. All code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/Jasaxion/LexSemBridge/

Result: 在三个公共QA基准测试中，RFM - RAG优于先前方法，提高了整体系统准确性。

Conclusion: RFM - RAG有效解决了RAG方法的问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they face inherent limitations such as constrained
parametric knowledge and high retraining costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) augments the generation process by retrieving externally stored knowledge
absent from the models internal parameters. However, RAG methods face
challenges such as information loss and redundant retrievals during multi-round
queries, accompanying the difficulties in precisely characterizing knowledge
gaps for complex tasks. To address these problems, we propose Retrieval
Feedback and Memory Retrieval Augmented Generation(RFM-RAG), which transforms
the stateless retrieval of previous methods into stateful continuous knowledge
management by constructing a dynamic evidence pool. Specifically, our method
generates refined queries describing the models knowledge gaps using relational
triples from questions and evidence from the dynamic evidence pool; Retrieves
critical external knowledge to iteratively update this evidence pool; Employs a
R-Feedback Model to evaluate evidence completeness until convergence. Compared
to traditional RAG methods, our approach enables persistent storage of
retrieved passages and effectively distills key information from passages to
construct clearly new queries. Experiments on three public QA benchmarks
demonstrate that RFM-RAG outperforms previous methods and improves overall
system accuracy.

Method: HyST框架结合大语言模型的结构化过滤和语义嵌入搜索，用大语言模型从自然语言提取属性级约束作为元数据过滤器，通过基于嵌入的检索处理剩余非结构化查询组件。

Result: 在半结构化基准测试中，HyST始终优于传统基线。

Conclusion: 结构化过滤对提高检索精度很重要，HyST为现实用户查询提供了可扩展且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: User queries in real-world recommendation systems often combine structured
constraints (e.g., category, attributes) with unstructured preferences (e.g.,
product descriptions or reviews). We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over
Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines
LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support
complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts
attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models
(LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining
unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a
semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional
baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving
retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world
user queries.

Motivation: 当前AIGC系统难生成个性化内容，个性化内容生成在实际应用中有重要价值，但面临建模、效率、数据构建等挑战。

Method: 提出HLLM - Creator框架，推理时结合用户聚类和剪枝策略提高效率，设计基于思维链推理的数据构建管道。

Result: 在抖音搜索广告个性化标题生成实验中有效，在线A/B测试使Adss提升0.476%。

Conclusion: HLLM - Creator框架为工业场景下更有效和高效的个性化生成铺平道路。

Abstract: AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.
However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely
generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as
online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with
different users focusing on different features. This underscores the
significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective
personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately
modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation
process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency
and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.
Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice
complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We
propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest
modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination
of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is
employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce
computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale
deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on
chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific
creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized
data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of
our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin
Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a
0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient
personalized generation in industrial scenarios. Codes for academic dataset are

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效提升对话式多模态产品检索的准确性，更好地契合用户不断变化的意图。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional
product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.
Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown
promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios
and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn
dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as
a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance
through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically
relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical
reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are
rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are
often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding
responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose
a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational
multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,
further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves
retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent
throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent
improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in
nDCG@1.

Conclusion: PCR - CA框架在真实部署中有效，已全面部署到微软应用商店。

Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as
traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to
suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook
Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for
improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings
from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns
discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --
unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables
independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better
modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative
signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item
levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a
dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to
capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a
large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong
baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further
validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement
in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new
framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.

Conclusion: 该可扩展和自适应框架有提升制造效率潜力，为裁剪订单规划优化创新奠定基础。

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

Conclusion: 在数据有限的科学领域，精心设计的简单架构优于易过拟合的复杂架构。

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable
development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network,
data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing
the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

Method: 提出DyCF和DyCG两种方法，DyCF利用Christoffel函数，DyCG利用其增长特性，基于代数框架。

Result: 使用合成和真实工业数据流对比，DyCF在执行时间和内存使用上优于微调方法，DyCG性能稍逊但无需调参。

Conclusion: DyCF和DyCG为数据流异常检测提供了有效方法，各有优势。

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework
empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in
specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research
community in this area, we release our project at

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

improvements over existing approaches such as Variational Continual Learning

proves particularly effective in maintaining knowledge across sequential tasks
while improving model accuracy. Experimental results show our approach not only
boosts immediate task performance but also significantly mitigates knowledge
degradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks

Conclusion: UEM框架和UEM - GFT能灵活适应不同图结构，揭示更多图信号信息，在异常检测任务中性能优越。

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

Conclusion: DGGN能有效解决少样本类增量故障诊断中的挑战，提升诊断效果。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to
continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without
forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However,
this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

Conclusion: 将统计推理与现代基础模型结合，能在现实世界时间序列应用中提高准确性、可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a
surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to
uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

Method: 通过类网格细胞层编码输入，用类齿状回模块进行稀疏模式分离，在类CA3自联想记忆中维护情景记忆，用DG门控专家混合机制动态管理任务处理，用弹性权重巩固合并皮质输出，纳入优先重放机制。

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

TL;DR: 本文提出结合拉普拉斯扩散技术的Transformer模型来建模患者身体活动驱动的心率波动，在真实数据集上验证优于现有方法，是支持远程患者监测的有效工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程心率监测未充分结合患者身体活动数据，难以评估心率变化是否显著，AI模型对活动数据整合关注少。

Method: 提出结合拉普拉斯扩散技术的Transformer模型，用专门嵌入和注意力机制使建模过程以活动上下文为条件，纳入上下文嵌入和专用编码器。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，相比基线模型平均绝对误差降低43%，决定系数R²为0.97，预测心率与实际心率高度一致。

Conclusion: 所提出模型是支持医护人员和远程患者监测系统的实用有效工具。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于签名的近似方法对高效生成建模有效。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

Result: WISCA显著提升收敛质量，零样本验证任务平均提升5.6%，多架构训练困惑度平均降低2.12%。

Conclusion: WISCA方法能有效提升训练效率和模型质量，尤其在GQA架构和LoRA微调任务中效果明显。

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple
architectures.

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in
small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining
distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a
natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore,
we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend
\textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through
Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we
explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline
distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we
specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Result: 给出所提方法的近似误差和收敛性分析，表明近似误差有上界，方法可收敛。在四种设置实验中提升了HNNs性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效改善HNNs的性能。

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

Motivation: 大语言模型规模和计算需求大，标准SVD压缩会导致功能性能损失，现有方法未充分纠正压缩中丢失的功能信息。

Method: 引入Corrective Adaptive Low - Rank Decomposition (CALR)，结合SVD压缩层主路径与可学习的低秩校正模块来恢复功能残差误差。

Result: 在SmolLM2 - 135M、Qwen3 - 0.6B和Llama - 3.2 - 1B上实验，CALR减少参数26.93%到51.77%，保留原模型性能59.45%到90.42%，优于LaCo、ShortGPT和LoSparse。

Conclusion: 将功能信息损失作为可学习信号是有效的压缩范式，能创建更小、更高效的大语言模型，推动其在现实应用中的可访问性和实际部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

Method: 基于注意力矩阵的有效秩，为注意力模型提出一种新的容量概念。

Result: 得到一个泛化界，其对样本大小的依赖性在对数因子范围内与大语言模型的经验缩放定律相符。

Conclusion: 虽不是过参数化学习的完整理论，但表明注意力的谱特性而非原始参数数量，可能是理解模型泛化的正确视角。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

Conclusion: STGAtt在实际交通流量预测应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Conclusion: AR易于实现和复现，能在数据和资源受限的情况下实现稳健学习，仅在有益时干预，不必要时逐渐消失。

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Conclusion: 建立了上下文学习与算法模拟的直接联系，表明大Transformer可作为提示可编程的算法库，现代Transformer模型具有算法通用性。

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric
relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear
subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace
dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that
is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有回归校准指标定义、假设和尺度不同，难以解释和比较结果，且多数重新校准方法评估指标少，不确定改进是否通用。

Method: 从文献中系统提取和分类回归校准指标，独立于特定建模方法或重新校准方法对这些指标进行基准测试，通过真实、合成和人工校准错误的数据进行对照实验。

Result: 校准指标经常产生冲突结果，评估同一重新校准结果时许多指标存在分歧，甚至得出矛盾结论。

Conclusion: 确定ENCE和CWC为最可靠指标，强调校准研究中指标选择的关键作用。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

Result: 在从表格DL到拆分学习等各种深度学习任务的实证评估中，ALSO优于传统优化器和现有DRO方法。

Conclusion: ALSO能有效解决DRO与DL实践的差距问题，是一种性能更优的自适应优化算法。

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Conclusion: 框架提供评估MPNN性能的诊断工具和通过图修改提升性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

Conclusion: 通过几个排队论等领域的例子证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian
models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and
analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Conclusion: 小模型能可靠地支撑大模型，避免强教师模型可能引入的误导性提示，WST是高效安全的大语言模型提示优化可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and
Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold
larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts
that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution
for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Abstract: Taxonomic classification in biodiversity research involves organizing
biological specimens into structured hierarchies based on evidence, which can
come from multiple modalities such as images and genetic information. We
investigate whether hyperbolic networks can provide a better embedding space
for such hierarchical models. Our method embeds multimodal inputs into a shared
hyperbolic space using contrastive and a novel stacked entailment-based
objective. Experiments on the BIOSCAN-1M dataset show that hyperbolic embedding
achieves competitive performance with Euclidean baselines, and outperforms all
other models on unseen species classification using DNA barcodes. However,
fine-grained classification and open-world generalization remain challenging.
Our framework offers a structure-aware foundation for biodiversity modelling,
with potential applications to species discovery, ecological monitoring, and
conservation efforts.

Conclusion: 基于适当分数的框架为机器学习不确定性量化提供有效途径，可用于多领域模型评估。

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

tasks predictably scales with LLM size, training duration, and estimated FLOPs.
We also show that In-Context Learning scores are strongly correlated with

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model
depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an
extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 所提方法能提升OLSE的准确性和鲁棒性，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效加速HGNNs在EDA电路图数据集上的训练。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural
signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems
neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared
latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known
ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining
learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network
representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the
co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards
incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of
large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

TL;DR: 提出Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor - MoE)模型处理概率和点回归，理论证明其最优风险率，实证表现优于NGBoost。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学和工程中不确定性下的回归问题。

Method: 用调优的梯度提升模型提供锚均值，将锚预测投影到潜在空间，通过可学习的度量窗口核和软路由器分配样本到专家，最小化负对数似然训练，在校准集上拟合线性映射。

Result: 理论上证明Anchor - MoE达到最小最大最优L²风险率，CRPS测试泛化差距等有特定缩放规律；实证上在标准UCI回归中表现优于NGBoost，在部分数据集达新的概率回归最优结果。

Conclusion: Anchor - MoE是一个有效处理概率和点回归的模型，代码开源。

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明UPN在连续归一化流、时间序列预测和轨迹预测等多个领域有效。

Conclusion: UPN能自然地将不确定性量化融入连续时间建模，在多个领域有良好效果。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Result: 发现即使在单层中，单个节点的特定信息也会显著稀释。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供新见解，有助于开发信息丰富的图表示。

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine
learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Motivation: 当前机器学习质量预测模型在动态制造环境分布偏移时存在局限性。

Result: 相比传统方法表现更优，在实际焊接场景能维持强大质量预测能力。

Conclusion: 为动态制造过程质量保证提供可解释且自适应解决方案，推动工业环境实用AI系统发展。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

Motivation: 传统预测复合材料有效特性的方法，前者运行成本高，后者可解释性差，需一种兼具成本效益和可解释性的方法。

Method: 基于强对比度展开（SCE）形式主义构建模型，提出受SCE启发的Neural Contrast Expansion（NCE）架构从结构 - 属性数据中学习替代PDE核。

Result: 在静态传导和电磁波传播案例中，NCE模型能揭示准确且有价值的敏感性信息，用于材料设计。

Conclusion: 与其他PDE核学习方法相比，该方法只需宏观属性测量，在材料开发中更易获取。

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Conclusion: 框架为地图对齐提供可扩展实用解决方案，是传统方法的有效替代。

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络优化在GPU内存和计算时间上的瓶颈问题，且现有加速技术通常孤立使用。

Method: 提出Tri - Accel框架，包含Precision - Adaptive Updates、Sparse Second - Order Signals和Memory - Elastic Batch Scaling三种策略，使用自定义Triton内核实现。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10等数据集上，实现训练时间最多减少9.9%，内存使用降低13.3%，准确率提升1.1个百分点，与静态混合精度训练相比，内存从0.35GB减至0.31GB且保持78.1%准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架结合算法适应性和硬件感知，能提高资源受限场景下的可扩展性，为边缘设备和云部署的神经网络训练提供高效途径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Conclusion: 结合人口编码SNN和强化引导超启发式方法在现实金融应用的欺诈检测中具有公平、透明和高性能的潜力。

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

Conclusion: 研究为注意力几何特性提供新见解，为大语言模型中改善稀疏字典学习提供实用工具。

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验显示该方法性能显著。

Conclusion: 所提出的DUFL机制能有效协调本地数据的陈旧性和数量，提升联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Conclusion: RuscaRL框架有效打破了大语言模型推理的探索瓶颈，能拓展推理边界。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of
reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma
persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet
the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

Conclusion: PSI为发现、量化和研究神经网络中的多义单元提供了有原则且实用的手段。

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型推理中KV缓存线性增长是瓶颈，已有CARTRIDGES方法可减少内存使用，本文旨在对其键值缓存结构进行机制探索。

Method: 提出CARTRIDGE键和值的作用假设，通过跨任务、模型族和模型大小的实验给出路由理论实证，提出Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI) 初始化方法。

Result: 能在任务间消融学习到的CARTRIDGE键向量且性能损失小，SCI能比文献中展示的更快使CARTRIDGE收敛。

Conclusion: 研究为CARTRIDGE训练优化的更广泛实证研究奠定基础，对进一步扩展可能至关重要。

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

Result: 在九个公开基准数据集上似然得分超现有模型，比TreeFlow提升9.64%，推理速度比NodeFlow快5.6倍，在二手车价格预测任务表现好。

Conclusion: TabResFlow在表格回归任务表现优异，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

Conclusion: 这些方法为大规模数据分析和生物医学应用提供高效、可扩展和可解释工具。

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

results reveal that CNN-based approaches, especially the multiple-branch model,

the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance railway safety and
operational efficiency by more effectively capturing intricate patterns in

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 分布式学习受拜占庭故障和高通信成本挑战，现有方法简单结合通信压缩和拜占庭鲁棒聚合会降低对故障节点的恢复能力，需新算法解决。

Method: 提出新算法RoSDHB，集成经典Polyak动量和新的协调压缩机制。

Result: 在标准(G, B) - 梯度差异异质性模型下，RoSDHB与Byz - DASHA - PAGE表现相当，且所需假设更少；基准图像分类任务实证结果显示其有强鲁棒性和显著通信节省。

Conclusion: RoSDHB是一个有效的分布式学习算法，能在解决拜占庭故障和通信成本问题上取得良好效果。

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

Motivation: 大规模MoE模型在边缘设备部署受内存限制，传统启发式专家缓存策略随模型参数规模增大难以维持高缓存命中率。

Method: 将任务构建为多标签序列预测问题，用DeepSeek - V2 - Chat - Lite MoE从LDJnr - Puffin数据集中提取6600万个专家激活轨迹训练轻量级Transformer模型。

Result: 预测器在WebGLM - QA数据集上达到97.5%的准确率和86.6%的F1分数，模拟显示MoE - Beyond在仅10%专家适合GPU缓存时将GPU缓存命中率从17%提高到72%，优于启发式基线。

Conclusion: MoE - Beyond能有效提高资源受限环境下大规模MoE模型的效率。

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

Result: 对于满足Polyak - Lojasiewicz条件的平滑目标函数，在EI异质性假设下，OGQ增强瞬态性能并降低稳态方差，SGQ比SGD改善瞬态性能。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization,
yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can
exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding
harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human
monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API
defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark
(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model
safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research
in this critical area. Code and data are available online

Conclusion: ONG方法结合了正交梯度下降和自然梯度的优势，有望解决正交梯度下降在学习任务中的收敛问题。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be
found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

Motivation: 现有基于几何投影的OOD算法会将对抗性ID样本误判为OOD，且针对攻击下ID和OOD数据的OOD检测研究较少，因此需要开发能区分对抗性ID样本和OOD样本的鲁棒OOD检测方法。

Method: 引入SaGD框架平滑投影潜在几何中的对抗损失景观，在对抗训练中使用基于抖动的扰动扩展对未知攻击的防御能力。

Result: SaGD框架在区分CIFAR - 100和其他六个OOD数据集时，在各种攻击下显著提高了FPR和AUC。

Conclusion: 提出的SaGD框架有效提升了对抗攻击下OOD检测的性能，还揭示了尖锐损失景观与对抗OOD检测的关系。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing
relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural
networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to
their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention
mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there
are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this
paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in
designing attention for graph transformers.

Conclusion: 为大语言模型自信的多成分结构提供机制证据，指出缓解过度自信行为的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI中基于RAG的大视觉语言模型存在安全漏洞，需探测其脆弱性。

Method: 提出MedThreatRAG框架，构建模拟半开放攻击环境，引入CMCI注入跨模态冲突。

Result: 在IU - Xray和MIMIC - CXR QA任务评估中，降低答案F1分数，LLaVA - Med - 1.5 F1率最低至51.36%。

Conclusion: 临床RAG系统存在安全缺口，需威胁感知设计和一致性检查，给出未来系统安全开发指南。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

Method: 提出将决策Transformer与广义策略梯度（GPG）框架相结合的路径规划解决方案。

Result: 在Sioux Falls Network (SFN)上的实验表明，该方法在准时到达概率方面优于以往基线。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案提高了路径决策的准确性和稳定性，能提供更准确的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

Motivation: 现有参数高效遗忘方法在Transformer中以模块无关方式设计，难以准确识别关键参数，导致遗忘性能不佳。

Method: 提出MAPE - Unlearn，用可学习的掩码对确定Transformer头和过滤器中的关键参数，通过基于热启动贪婪搜索的高效算法优化掩码学习目标。

Result: 在各种Transformer模型和数据集上的大量实验表明MAPE - Unlearn有效且鲁棒。

Conclusion: MAPE - Unlearn能有效解决Transformer现有遗忘方法的问题，可用于高效的机器遗忘。

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

Conclusion: VGG神经网络方法可用于近地面翼型升阻系数预测，且在准确性上有优势。

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near
the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of
data from CFD simulation results and the development of new neural network
methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods
like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag
coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

TL;DR: 提出PINN框架预测核反应堆辐照钢低周疲劳寿命，优于传统模型，能提供可靠且可解释的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经验模型无法准确捕捉核反应堆中辐照奥氏体和铁素体/马氏体钢在循环加载和高温辐照下的复杂退化情况，需新方法预测低周疲劳寿命。

Method: 开发PINN模型，将物理疲劳寿命约束纳入损失函数，用495个数据点训练。

Result: PINN模型优于随机森林、梯度提升等传统机器学习模型；SHAP分析确定应变幅值、辐照剂量和测试温度为主要特征，与疲劳寿命负相关；PINN能捕捉F/M钢在高应变幅值下疲劳寿命的饱和行为。

Conclusion: PINN框架为预测辐照合金疲劳寿命提供可靠且可解释的方法，有助于合金选择。

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器依赖固定稀疏约束，未考虑输入复杂性，难以理解大语言模型内部表示。

Method: 提出AdaptiveK框架，基于输入语义复杂度动态调整稀疏度，利用线性探针指导特征分配。

Result: 在Pythia - 70M、Pythia - 160M和Gemma - 2 - 2B三个语言模型实验中，该方法在重建保真度、解释方差和余弦相似度指标上显著优于固定稀疏方法，且消除了大量超参数调优的计算负担。

Conclusion: 复杂度驱动的自适应方法能有效提升稀疏自编码器性能，为理解大语言模型内部表示提供新途径。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 探究单位球面上浅层ReLU神经网络学习动态及频率原则适用性。

Method: 采用球谐展开分析固定和可训练权重情况，结合数值实验。

Result: 固定权重有低频偏好但特定条件下频率原则可被违反；可训练权重也有低频学习倾向且增加学习复杂度，特定条件下原则也可被违反。

Conclusion: 频率原则在S²等曲面上是一种趋势而非规则，方向更新和调和展开影响频率依赖学习。

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

reducing generation complexity and enhancing scalability. Additionally, SLM
incorporates a flexible implementation of classifier-free guidance, enhancing

Conclusion: 探讨了FPA的防御用途及对代码导向LLMs可靠性和安全性的更广泛影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated
code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，相比现有多模态VAE，具有更好的一致性和合成质量，能处理更多模态。

Conclusion: ShaLa能有效推理共享潜在表征，提升下游多模态合成质量，可处理更多模态。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

Motivation: 联邦学习系统面临客户端计算资源受限和对常见损坏缺乏鲁棒性的挑战，现有方法计算成本高不适合资源受限客户端。

Method: 提出FedERL，在服务器端采用数据无关的鲁棒训练（DART）方法增强鲁棒性，确保客户端零鲁棒性开销。

Result: 实验表明FedERL能以传统鲁棒训练方法一小部分的时间和能量成本处理常见损坏。

Conclusion: 在时间和能量预算有限的场景中，FedERL超越传统鲁棒训练，是现实世界联邦学习应用实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains
challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,
while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent
advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via
explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a
GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by
LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these
tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.
Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work
highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides

Motivation: 当前自主实验认知控制有限，缺乏检测和适应意外情况的机制，传统惊喜度量无法反映系统是否真正学习和适应。

Method: 引入MIS框架，开发统计测试序列检测互信息变化，提出MISRP策略动态调整系统行为。

Result: 在合成领域和动态污染地图估计任务中，MISRP策略在稳定性、响应能力和预测准确性上显著优于经典基于惊喜的方法。

Conclusion: MIS将惊喜从被动反应转变为主动反思，为构建更具自我意识和适应性的自主系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

Method: 提出新风险评估方法，从目标系统部署环境、AML技术特点、过往研究经验三方面量化风险，含可行性评分机制与LLM定制，构建AML攻击数据集。

Result: 在六个真实应用中验证，评估准确性高，与AML专家分析高度一致。

Conclusion: FRAME框架能使组织确定AML风险优先级，支持现实环境中安全AI部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world

TL;DR: 介绍Modular MeanFlow (MMF)方法用于一步生成式建模，统一并推广现有方法，实验显示其在多任务中有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升一步生成式建模效率，改进现有基于扩散或流的模型。

Method: 推导基于微分恒等式的损失函数族，引入梯度调制机制，提出课程式预热调度。

Result: 在图像合成和轨迹建模任务中，MMF实现了有竞争力的样本质量、稳健收敛和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MMF是一种灵活且理论扎实的方法，统一并推广现有方法，避免高阶导数，在多种场景表现良好。

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional
diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow
(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under
low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有通过强化学习对齐大语言模型在解决复杂推理问题时存在在线策略滚动成本高、探索多样推理路径有限的问题。

Method: 引入TreePO，采用自引导滚动算法，包含动态树采样策略和定长段解码，利用局部不确定性保证额外分支，还有段式采样算法、基于树的段级优势估计等。

Conclusion: TreePO在提供推理效率提升的同时，为基于强化学习的后训练以更少样本和计算量进行扩展提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鲁棒约束强化学习中强对偶性通常不成立，传统原始 - 对偶方法可能无法找到最优可行策略。

Method: 提出一种名为Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO)的仅原始算法，直接处理原始问题，不依赖对偶公式。

Result: 在温和的正则性假设下有理论收敛保证，不确定性集合直径在特定水平时迭代复杂度与已知下界匹配；网格世界环境的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RRPO能在模型不确定性下实现鲁棒和安全的性能，而非鲁棒方法可能违反最坏情况下的安全约束。

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate
the worst-case safety constraints.

Method: 提出ReviBranch深度强化学习框架，构建复兴轨迹让智能体学习分支过程的结构演化和时间依赖，引入重要性加权奖励再分配机制解决稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 在不同混合整数线性规划基准测试中，ReviBranch优于现有强化学习方法，在大规模实例上减少4.0%的分支定界节点和2.2%的线性规划迭代。

Conclusion: ReviBranch在异构混合整数线性规划问题类中具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

Abstract: Classification in the context of multi-label data streams represents a
challenge that has attracted significant attention due to its high real-world
applicability. However, this task faces problems inherent to dynamic
environments, such as the continuous arrival of data at high speed and volume,
changes in the data distribution (concept drift), the emergence of new labels
(concept evolution), and the latency in the arrival of ground truth labels.
This systematic literature review presents an in-depth analysis of multi-label
data stream classification proposals. We characterize the latest methods in the
literature, providing a comprehensive overview, building a thorough hierarchy,
and discussing how the proposals approach each problem. Furthermore, we discuss
the adopted evaluation strategies and analyze the methods' asymptotic
complexity and resource consumption. Finally, we identify the main gaps and
offer recommendations for future research directions in the field.

Method: 提出四条证据支持假设，包括理论解释、在玩具模型和ResNet18中干预叠加与鲁棒性的实验。

Result: 在理论和不同模型实验中证明叠加与对抗样本现象相关。

Conclusion: 叠加可能是对抗样本产生的一个主要因素甚至是根本原因。

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态表征学习模型存在未充分利用不同对间语义关系、缺乏上下文匹配及模态内一致性支持不足等局限。

Method: 提出Relation - Conditioned Multimodal Learning (RCML)框架，构建由语义关系连接的多对多训练对，引入关系引导的跨注意力机制，结合模态间和模态内对比损失。

Result: 在不同数据集的检索和分类任务上，RCML始终优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 利用语义关系指导多模态表征学习是有效的。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

Result: 在51个公开单变量TSC基准上的实验表明，DLNs在新领域保持了竞争精度、低推理成本和可解释性。

Conclusion: DLNs在单变量TSC领域能保持其在表格分类和回归任务中的核心优势。

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和计算效率都重要的时间序列预测实际应用中有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant
challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation,
which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics.
In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential
Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation
framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our
approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous
latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to
focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30

superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only
improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling
of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often
irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and
anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic
Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling
with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular
observations. Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a
numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse
sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate
strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a

Conclusion: 基于Gumbel - Softmax的重连方法能有效提升MPNN在节点分类中的性能。

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

Result: 能判断特征是线性传输还是非线性合成，给出传输效率上限，估计线性传输对应子空间大小。

Conclusion: 该计算轻量方法为安全、调试提供实用工具，明晰大语言模型中线性运算位置。

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into
executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity
and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and
original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to
prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有SGD - LFA方法仅依赖当前样本瞬时梯度信息，未结合历史经验和样本内在关联，导致收敛慢和泛化性能不佳

Result: 对比实验表明PILF模型在HDI矩阵上有优越的表示能力

Conclusion: PILF模型能有效解决现有SGD - LFA方法的局限，在HDI矩阵上表现良好

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

Conclusion: QGAT有跨领域可扩展量子增强学习潜力，可处理真实噪声数据，能融入现有架构增强经典模型。

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation
with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's
disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential
patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in
ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects
neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings
highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing
longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

Motivation: 静态数据混合策略欠佳，模型对不同数据域的学习偏好动态变化，且高效观察这些偏好是挑战。

Method: 提出TiKMiX方法，引入Group Influence指标，将数据混合问题转化为寻找最优分布，有TiKMiX - D直接优化和TiKMiX - M用回归模型预测两种实现途径。

Result: TiKMiX - D用20%计算资源超越REGMIX，TiKMiX - M在9个下游基准测试中平均性能提升2%。

Conclusion: 模型数据偏好随训练进展和规模演变，基于Group Influence动态调整数据混合可显著提升性能，缓解静态比例下的数据消化不足问题。

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

Result: 通过套件分析了基于Mamba的SSM在GPU上运行的架构影响。

Conclusion: 为这类模型性能持续扩展的潜在优化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

Conclusion: 去学习消融法为绘制AI科学发现的真正范围和局限性提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

Conclusion: 空中模型训练是大规模客户端网络联合学习的可行方法。

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in
bioengineering and biological research, significantly accelerating discovery
processes. However, this advancement introduces critical concerns regarding
intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we propose the
first robust watermarking method designed for molecules, which utilizes
atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to
ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method using the datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUG,
and generative models GeoBFN and GeoLDM. We demonstrate the feasibility of
embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root
mean square deviations below 1.602 \AA. These results confirm that our
watermarking technique effectively safeguards molecular intellectual property
without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI

Conclusion: SSD能有效为大语言模型赋予安全属性，同时提升推理效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

Result: 随机去除高达50%嵌入维度，检索和分类任务性能下降不到10%；去除大量均匀分布维度时性能有提升；在生成任务中也有类似现象。

Conclusion: 截断文本嵌入造成的性能下降现象并非是由于表征空间利用无效，而是因为大量均匀分布维度去除会提升性能，且该现象不限于分类或检索任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 解决长期稀疏奖励环境中的挑战。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为多层抽象，每层定义抽象状态空间并使用选项将轨迹模块化，引入层内策略和任务动作。

Result: 在程序生成的网格环境实验中，样本效率和泛化能力相比标准强化学习方法有显著提升，增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: MANGO框架在长期稀疏奖励环境中表现良好，未来需探索自动化抽象发现、适应连续或模糊环境和更鲁棒的多层训练策略。

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

Conclusion: SuperGen能有效解决超高清视频生成难题，在性能和质量上表现良好。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有深度学习工作负载调度方法有局限，如针对单模型、忽略配置差异、执行时间估计不准。

Method: 提出基于基因算法的方法，将网络分割成子图，用三种染色体探索分区、映射和优先级，结合设备在环分析评估来准确估计执行时间。

Result: 系统Puzzle在评估中表现优异，相比NPU Only和Best Mapping，平均支持更高请求频率，且满足实时要求。

Conclusion: 基于基因算法的调度方法有效，能提升多深度学习网络在异构处理器上的调度性能。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

Motivation: 解决基础模型监督微调（SFT）泛化性差，调优后原有能力下降的问题。

Method: 受强化学习中信任域策略优化（TRPO）和近端策略优化（PPO）启发，提出PSFT，将信任域优势融入微调目标，约束策略漂移。

Result: 在数学和人类价值领域实验表明，PSFT在域内与SFT相当，域外泛化性更优，长时间训练稳定无熵坍塌，为后续优化提供更好基础。

Conclusion: PSFT能稳定优化并实现泛化，在微调方面有良好表现，为后续优化留空间。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

Method: 构建理论框架分析模型选择能力和几何分离，设定距离界限和分离标准，用预训练GPT - 2模型进行实验。

Result: 选择的令牌数量增加时，模型区分信息令牌的能力下降，趋于均匀选择模式；softmax归一化下梯度敏感性在训练时尤其是低温设置下带来挑战。

Conclusion: 研究推进了对基于softmax的注意力机制的理解，表明未来注意力架构需要更稳健的归一化和选择策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Result: GEPO理论上实现指数级方差减少，实验中比GRPO稳定性好，1800秒延迟下性能下降小于3%。

Conclusion: HeteroRL和GEPO在异构网络的去中心化RL中有强大潜力。

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Conclusion: Ada - TransGNN能更准确捕获监测点空间关系，有效提高预测结果准确性。

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

Motivation: 现有基于时域或频域的频谱预测方法难以从噪声中分离可预测模式，需要准确的频谱预测用于动态频谱接入和资源分配。

Method: SFFP框架先使用自适应分数阶傅里叶变换模块转换数据，再用自适应滤波器模块抑制噪声，最后用复值神经网络进行预测。

Result: 在真实频谱数据实验中，SFFP框架优于领先的频谱和通用预测方法。

Conclusion: SFFP框架能有效提高频谱预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and
resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum
data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to
separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the
Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first
employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Conclusion: 几何约束是释放LoRA在大语言模型微调中全部潜力的关键。

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across
benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints
are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 提出的统一方法可有效检测多任务数据集中的标签错误。

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Result: 在五个不同复杂度数据集实验中，FedMate优于现有方法；在自动驾驶数据集语义分割实验验证可扩展性。

Conclusion: FedMate能有效协调泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Conclusion: 该拓扑感知插值的神经方案有效，能瞬时产生插值输出，在数据和拓扑拟合上表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更鲁棒的DNN提供了见解。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

Conclusion: 所提图Transformer架构在模拟物理时具有良好的可扩展性和性能，是解决现有问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有GNN相关理论局限于属性离散动态图，而现实世界系统是异步演化且可能有不连通组件，需要扩展理论。

Result: 确定了一类能保留区分能力和通用逼近保证的CGNNs，构造性证明得出实用设计准则。

Conclusion: 强调了具有分段连续可微时间函数的紧凑且表达性强的CGNN架构可处理异步、不连通图。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR - 10实验中，FedGreed在多数对抗场景下显著优于标准和鲁棒联邦学习基准方法。

Conclusion: FedGreed策略能可靠应对强对抗行为，在非IID数据分布下表现良好。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated
learning framework.

Motivation: 现有GNSS欺骗检测方法依赖监督学习，难以检测新的、演变的和未知的攻击，因此需要开发新方法。

Method: 开发使用HQC - AE的零日欺骗检测方法，仅在真实GNSS信号上训练，利用跟踪阶段提取的特征进行主动检测。

Result: HQC - AE在检测零日、未知GNSS时间推进欺骗攻击方面始终优于经典对应方法、传统监督学习模型和现有无监督学习方法，平均检测准确率达97.71%，平均假阴性率为0.62%；对于复杂攻击，准确率达98.23%，假阴性率为1.85%。

Conclusion: 该方法能在各种静态GNSS接收器平台上主动检测零日GNSS时间推进欺骗攻击，具有有效性。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable
to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

Conclusion: 结合EM推理和流匹配的方法对解决混合噪声贝叶斯逆问题是有效的。

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large

CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated
questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical
frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity,

LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging
tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression
Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial

and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach
only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a

Motivation: Transformer的二次自注意力和弱时间偏差使长序列预测成本高且不稳定，需要改进方法。

Result: 在七个标准长序列预测基准测试中，FreezeTST表现与或超过专门变体，且计算量大幅降低。

Conclusion: 在Transformer中嵌入水库原理是实现高效长序列时间序列预测的简单且有原则的途径。

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex
systems.

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

Result: 提升了收敛速度和系统效率，给出了模型完全收敛所需通信次数的理论估计。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效改进了大语言模型分布式训练效果。

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

Motivation: 现有回声状态网络（ESNs）的欧几里得几何与混沌的拉伸 - 折叠结构不匹配，难以对混沌动力学进行长时间预测。

Method: 引入HypER，其神经元在庞加莱球中采样，连接随双曲距离指数衰减，训练限于Tikhonov正则化读出。

Result: 在混沌系统和真实世界基准测试中，HypER持续延长平均有效预测时间，相比基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: HypER在混沌动力学预测方面有优势，并建立了状态发散率的下限。

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

Conclusion: 所提出的技术在处理异常值方面有效，可用于物联网网络定位。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

Conclusion: TACs为开发可靠、符合任务要求的大语言模型系统提供了一个稳健且有理论依据的范式。

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

*Novin Shahroudi,Viacheslav Komisarenko,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出预测评估应结合下游任务，提出数据驱动方法学习与下游评估一致的代理评估函数，通过实验展示其缩小预测评估与下游效用差距的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测评估指标与下游任务影响衡量存在差异，现有结合下游视角的方法存在分析负担重或需先验成本结构的问题。

Method: 提出数据驱动方法，基于适当评分规则理论探索规则变换，利用神经网络参数化加权评分规则学习权重以与下游任务性能对齐。

Result: 通过合成和真实数据的回归任务实验展示了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力缩小模块化预测系统中预测评估与下游效用的差距。

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.

TL;DR: 提出新型优化器Ano及Anolog，在噪声和非平稳环境表现好，低噪声任务也有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机优化器如Adam和Adan在非平稳或噪声环境中性能下降，因其依赖基于动量的幅度估计。

Method: 引入Ano，解耦方向和幅度，用动量进行方向平滑，瞬时梯度幅度确定步长；提出Anolog，通过对数时间表扩展窗口消除对动量系数的敏感性。

Result: 建立了非凸收敛保证，收敛率与其他基于符号的方法相似；在强化学习等噪声和非平稳场景有显著提升，在标准计算机视觉基准等低噪声任务也有竞争力。

Conclusion: Ano和Anolog优化器在不同环境下都有较好表现，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.

Method: 先证明小种群结合存档但不重用存档解在某些问题上会失败，再证明重用存档解可克服局限并加速，以SMS - EMOA算法应用于OneJumpZeroJump问题及变体为例分析，最后通过四个实际优化问题实验验证。

Result: 重用存档解能克服小种群局限，至少实现多项式加速，比直接用大种群更好，理论在实际中普遍成立。

Conclusion: 多目标进化算法中重用存档解可提升算法性能，在理论和实际中都有优势。

Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving
widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs
(MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store
non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1)
mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs,
and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this
paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs
through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We
first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without
incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain
problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising
solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this
limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running
time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied
to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants.
We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large
population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can
generally hold in practice by experiments on four well-known practical
optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and
NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.

Motivation: Arc - routing问题在很多领域很关键，RPP - mTD是RPP的广义形式，有重要研究价值。

Method: 提出混合遗传算法（HGA），结合基于种群的探索和目标邻域搜索，采用两层染色体编码解，引入定制的保留段交叉算子和多种局部搜索技术。

Result: 将HGA与现有单卡车 - 无人机实例对比，表现有竞争力，在新的大规模实例上评估有可扩展性。

Conclusion: 紧密集成的卡车 - 无人机车队有运营优势，HGA作为决策支持工具在先进混合车队物流中实用有效。

Abstract: Arc-routing problems underpin numerous critical field operations, including
power-line inspection, urban police patrolling, and traffic monitoring. In this
domain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a
prescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper
investigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a
fleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as
mobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to
execute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall
makespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid
Genetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with
targeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer
chromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required
edges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving
crossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques
to intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against
established single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive
performance. Additionally, we conduct extensive evaluations on new,
larger-scale instances to demonstrate scalability. Our findings highlight the
operational benefits of closely integrated truck-drone fleets, affirming the
HGA's practical effectiveness as a decision-support tool in advanced
mixed-fleet logistics.

TL;DR: 提出基于混合键合的加速器H2EAL用于边缘高效大语言模型推理，有算法硬件协同设计，实验显示有显著性能和能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型KV缓存导致高能耗和延迟开销，限制边缘部署，新兴混合键合技术有潜力但存在分布式内存瓶颈等问题。

Method: 算法层面提出混合稀疏注意力方案；硬件层面协同设计支持混合稀疏注意力并提出内存计算共放置；开发负载均衡调度器和优化映射策略。

Result: H2EAL在多个基准测试中实现5.20 - 48.21倍加速和6.22 - 73.48倍能效提升，平均精度下降仅0.87%。

Conclusion: H2EAL通过算法硬件协同设计，有效解决了大语言模型边缘部署中的问题，实现高效推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a
wide range of natural language processing applications. However, the high
energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment,
especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been
proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing
(NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power
consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this
paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse
attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge.
At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static
and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with
high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support
hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the
distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit
different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB
architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled
attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and
6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with
a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出shadowAttn稀疏注意力模块，在有限CPU/GPU资源下有最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架因量化敏感使注意力算子从NPU回退到CPU/GPU，导致用户体验下降和调度复杂，为解决此问题开展研究。

Method: 提出shadowAttn，通过在少量令牌上稀疏计算注意力减少对CPU/GPU依赖，用NPU预计算隐藏估计重要令牌的开销，还提出NPU计算图分桶等技术。

Result: shadowAttn在CPU/GPU资源高度受限下性能最佳，用更少资源达到与现有技术相当的性能。

Conclusion: shadowAttn是有效的系统 - 算法协同设计的稀疏注意力模块，能在保护用户隐私的设备端运行LLMs时提升性能。

Abstract: On-device running Large Language Models (LLMs) is nowadays a critical enabler
towards preserving user privacy. We observe that the attention operator falls
back from the special-purpose NPU to the general-purpose CPU/GPU because of
quantization sensitivity in state-of-the-art frameworks. This fallback results
in a degraded user experience and increased complexity in system scheduling. To
this end, this paper presents shadowAttn, a system-algorithm codesigned sparse
attention module with minimal reliance on CPU/GPU by only sparsely calculating
the attention on a tiny portion of tokens. The key idea is to hide the overhead
of estimating the important tokens with a NPU-based pilot compute. Further,
shadowAttn proposes insightful techniques such as NPU compute graph bucketing,
head-wise NPU-CPU/GPU pipeline and per-head fine-grained sparsity ratio to
achieve high accuracy and efficiency. shadowAttn delivers the best performance
with highly limited CPU/GPU resource; it requires much less CPU/GPU resource to
deliver on-par performance of SoTA frameworks.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLM量化方法在实际服务条件下性能、能耗和质量权衡的系统理解。

Method: 开发qMeter框架，对4种模型大小、2种GPU架构下的11种量化方法在应用、工作负载、并行性和硬件层面进行评估。

Result: 发现高度依赖任务和方法的权衡关系，对工作负载特征敏感，与并行性和GPU架构存在复杂交互。

Conclusion: 这是首次从性能、能耗和质量联合角度对LLM量化进行的综合表征研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but their heavy resource demands make quantization-reducing
precision to lower-bit formats-critical for efficient serving. While many
quantization methods exist, a systematic understanding of their performance,
energy, and quality tradeoffs in realistic serving conditions remains a gap. In
this work, we first develop a fully automated online characterization framework
qMeter, and then conduct an in-depth characterization of 11 post-training LLM
quantization methods across 4 model sizes (7B-70B) and two GPU architectures
(A100, H100). We evaluate quantization at the application, workload,
parallelism, and hardware levels under online serving conditions. Our study
reveals highly task- and method-dependent tradeoffs, strong sensitivity to
workload characteristics, and complex interactions with parallelism and GPU
architecture. We further present three optimization case studies illustrating
deployment challenges in capacity planning, energy-efficient scheduling, and
multi-objective tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first
comprehensive application-, system-, and hardware-level characterization of LLM
quantization from a joint performance, energy, and quality perspective.

Abstract: This book, by Molero, Juiz, and Rodeno, titled Performance Evaluation and
Modeling of Computer Systems, presents a comprehensive summary of simple
quantitative techniques that help answer the above questions. Its approach is
not one of theory for theory's sake; rather, in each chapter, after a brief
theoretical review, it delves deeply into numerous problems grouped into three
categories: those with complete solutions, those for which only the solution is
given, and, finally, those whose resolution is left to the reader's discretion.
Although some of the solved problems may be considered purely academic in terms
of complexity, they should not be underestimated, as they reveal, on a reduced
scale, the process that must be followed with the help of appropriate tools to
solve equivalent real-world problems of an industrial scale.

Motivation: 尽管弹性固态驱动器（ESSD）广泛集成到云服务中，但缺乏对其性能的全面特征分析，人们怀疑其能否替代本地SSD的存储职责并提供类似性能。

Method: 对亚马逊AWS和阿里云的两种ESSDs进行特征分析。

Result: 提出云ESSD未成文的契约，包含四个反直觉的观察和五个对云存储用户的启示。

Conclusion: 这些启示可指导用户重新审视其部署的云软件设计，利用ESSD的独特特性提升系统性能。

Abstract: Elastic block storage (EBS) with the storage-compute disaggregated
architecture stands as a pivotal piece in today's cloud. EBS furnishes users
with storage capabilities through the elastic solid-state drive (ESSD).
Nevertheless, despite the widespread integration into cloud services, the
absence of a thorough ESSD performance characterization raises critical doubt:
when more and more services are shifted onto the cloud, can ESSD satisfactorily
substitute the storage responsibilities of the local SSD and offer comparable
performance?
  In this paper, we for the first time target this question by characterizing
two ESSDs from Amazon AWS and Alibaba Cloud. We present an unwritten contract
of cloud-based ESSDs, encapsulating four observations and five implications for
cloud storage users. Specifically, the observations are counter-intuitive and
contrary to the conventional perceptions of what one would expect from the
local SSD. The implications we hope could guide users in revisiting the designs
of their deployed cloud software, i.e., harnessing the distinct characteristics
of ESSDs for better system performance.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究编译器优化对zkVM的影响，评估多种优化级别和基准测试，发现标准LLVM优化有提升但效果不如传统CPU，微调部分LLVM通道可进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有zkVM继承为传统架构调整的编译器基础设施，标准编译器优化对zkVM证明生成的影响存疑，需进行系统研究。

Method: 评估64个LLVM通道、6个标准优化级别和未优化基线，在两个基于RISC - V的zkVM上进行58个基准测试，并进行细粒度通道级分析。

Result: 标准LLVM优化级别能提升zkVM性能超40%，但效果远小于传统CPU；微调部分LLVM通道，zkVM执行时间最多提升45%，证明时间持续改善。

Conclusion: 凸显了编译器级优化对zkVM性能的潜力，为zkVM特定通道、后端和超级优化器开辟新方向。

Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable
cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation
across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such
as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the
barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation
pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional
languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits.
However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional
architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler
optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache
locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their
impact on proof generation is questionable.
  We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations
on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an
unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero
and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance
(over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their
decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a
fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM
passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average
+4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains.
Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM
performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and
superoptimizers.

Result: 在PaperBench Code - Dev基准上进行大量实验，RePro较基线有13.0%的性能提升，能正确修正复杂逻辑和数学标准。

Conclusion: RePro框架在论文代码复现方面效果显著。

Abstract: Reproducing machine learning papers is essential for scientific progress but
remains challenging for both humans and automated agents. Existing agent-based
methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details
such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that
reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current
paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap
mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and
varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans
use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose
\textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction
framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a
comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality
supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted
information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification
and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and
produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's
implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev
benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over
baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria
in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.

software project management. By deploying virtual agents in simulated software
environments, this study explores their potential to fulfill fundamental roles
in IT project development, thereby optimizing project outcomes through
intelligent automation. Particular emphasis is placed on the adaptability of
these agents to Agile methodologies and their transformative impact on
decision-making, problem-solving, and collaboration dynamics. The research
leverages the CogniSim ecosystem, a platform designed to simulate real-world
software engineering challenges, such as aligning technical capabilities with
business objectives, managing interdependencies, and maintaining project
agility. Through iterative simulations, cognitive agents demonstrate advanced
capabilities in task delegation, inter-agent communication, and project
lifecycle management. By employing natural language processing to facilitate
meaningful dialogues, these agents emulate human roles and improve the
efficiency and precision of Agile practices. Key findings from this
investigation highlight the ability of LLM-powered cognitive agents to deliver
measurable improvements in various metrics, including task completion times,
quality of deliverables, and communication coherence. These agents exhibit
scalability and adaptability, ensuring their applicability across diverse and
complex project environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating LLM-powered agents into Agile project management frameworks as a
means of advancing software engineering practices. This integration not only
refines the execution of project management tasks but also sets the stage for a
paradigm shift in how teams collaborate and address emerging challenges.

primarily due to economic and infrastructural constraints. This study
empirically evaluates local LLM deployment using Ollama as an alternative to
commercial cloud-based services for developer-focused applications. Through a
mixed-methods analysis involving 180 Indian developers, students, and AI
enthusiasts, we find that local deployment enables substantially greater
hands-on development and experimentation, while reducing costs by 33% compared
to commercial solutions. Developers using local LLMs completed over twice as
many experimental iterations and reported deeper understanding of advanced AI
architectures. Our results highlight local deployment as a critical enabler for
inclusive and accessible AI development, demonstrating how technological
accessibility can enhance learning outcomes and innovation capacity in

Method: 提出Cybernaut框架，包括SOP生成器、高精度HTML DOM元素识别系统和评估执行一致性的量化指标。

Result: 在内部基准测试中，该框架使任务执行成功率从72%提升到88.68%，能以84.7%的准确率识别一致执行模式。

Conclusion: Cybernaut在企业级网页自动化中有效，为未来网页自动化发展奠定基础。

Abstract: The emergence of AI-driven web automation through Large Language Models
(LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing digital workflows.
However, deploying such systems within industry's real-world environments
presents four core challenges: (1) ensuring consistent execution, (2)
accurately identifying critical HTML elements, (3) meeting human-like accuracy
in order to automate operations at scale and (4) the lack of comprehensive
benchmarking data on internal web applications. Existing solutions are
primarily tailored for well-designed, consumer-facing websites (e.g.,
Amazon.com, Apple.com) and fall short in addressing the complexity of
poorly-designed internal web interfaces. To address these limitations, we
present Cybernaut, a novel framework to ensure high execution consistency in
web automation agents designed for robust enterprise use. Our contributions are
threefold: (1) a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) generator that converts
user demonstrations into reliable automation instructions for linear browsing
tasks, (2) a high-precision HTML DOM element recognition system tailored for
the challenge of complex web interfaces, and (3) a quantitative metric to
assess execution consistency. The empirical evaluation on our internal
benchmark demonstrates that using our framework enables a 23.2% improvement
(from 72% to 88.68%) in task execution success rate over the browser_use.
Cybernaut identifies consistent execution patterns with 84.7% accuracy,
enabling reliable confidence assessment and adaptive guidance during task
execution in real-world systems. These results highlight Cybernaut's
effectiveness in enterprise-scale web automation and lay a foundation for
future advancements in web automation.

Abstract: System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a recommended method for
analysing complex systems, capable of identifying thousands of safety
requirements often missed by traditional techniques such as Failure Mode and
Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). However, the absence of
a structured framework for managing and prioritising these requirements
presents challenges, particularly in fast-paced development environments. This
paper introduces a scalable framework for prioritising STPA-derived
requirements. The framework integrates outputs from each STPA step and
incorporates expert evaluations based on four key factors: implementation time,
cost, requirement type, and regulatory coverage. To reduce subjectivity,
Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) is employed to calculate and stabilise requirement
rankings. An automation toolchain supports the framework, enabling dynamic
mapping of prioritised requirements in a scaling matrix. This visualisation
aids decision-making and ensures traceability across development phases. The
framework is applicable from early conceptualisation to more advanced stages,
enhancing its utility in iterative system development. The framework was
validated through a real-world case study focused on Electric Vertical Take-off
and Landing (eVTOL) operations, conducted in collaboration with the UK Civil
Aviation Authority. The findings contributed directly to CAP3141, a Civil
Aviation Publication that identifies systemic operational risks and safety
mitigations for regulators, operators, and vertiports. The prioritisation
process supported decision-making by helping stakeholders identify and manage
high-impact requirements efficiently. This work contributes a practical
solution for managing STPA outputs, bridging gaps in requirement prioritisation
and supporting safety-critical development in emerging technologies.

TL;DR: 下一代高能物理实验数据量大，需HPC集成，但面临软件移植和文档缺失问题。提出本地部署的CelloAI编码助手，利用LLMs和RAG支持代码文档和生成，经实验评估能提升代码理解和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代高能物理实验数据量大，需集成HPC，但传统软件移植到异构架构困难且代码文档稀疏，阻碍HPC在高能物理领域的应用。

Method: 提出本地部署的CelloAI编码助手，利用LLMs和RAG，通过专门组件处理代码文档和生成，文档处理含注释、摘要生成和交互聊天，代码生成采用语法感知分块策略和集成调用图知识。

Result: 使用ATLAS、CMS和DUNE实验的真实应用评估CelloAI，结果显示其能增强代码理解和支持可靠代码生成。

Conclusion: CelloAI能在满足科学计算环境透明和安全要求下，提升代码理解和支持可靠代码生成。

Abstract: Next-generation High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments will generate
unprecedented data volumes, necessitating High Performance Computing (HPC)
integration alongside traditional high-throughput computing. However, HPC
adoption in HEP is hindered by the challenge of porting legacy software to
heterogeneous architectures and the sparse documentation of these complex
scientific codebases. We present CelloAI, a locally hosted coding assistant
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) to support HEP code documentation and generation. This local deployment
ensures data privacy, eliminates recurring costs and provides access to large
context windows without external dependencies. CelloAI addresses two primary
use cases, code documentation and code generation, through specialized
components. For code documentation, the assistant provides: (a) Doxygen style
comment generation for all functions and classes by retrieving relevant
information from RAG sources (papers, posters, presentations), (b) file-level
summary generation, and (c) an interactive chatbot for code comprehension
queries. For code generation, CelloAI employs syntax-aware chunking strategies
that preserve syntactic boundaries during embedding, improving retrieval
accuracy in large codebases. The system integrates callgraph knowledge to
maintain dependency awareness during code modifications and provides
AI-generated suggestions for performance optimization and accurate refactoring.
We evaluate CelloAI using real-world HEP applications from ATLAS, CMS, and DUNE
experiments, comparing different embedding models for code retrieval
effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the AI assistant's capability to enhance
code understanding and support reliable code generation while maintaining the
transparency and safety requirements essential for scientific computing
environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出EyeMulator技术，让代码语言模型在训练时模仿人类视觉注意力，在多项任务上表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码语言模型的机器注意力仅基于输入输出标记的显著性，而人类开发者对标记显著性有直觉，因此想让模型模仿人类视觉注意力。

Method: 在大语言模型微调的损失函数中，为每个输入示例的每个标记添加特殊权重，权重来自软件工程任务眼动实验公开数据集。

Result: EyeMulator在代码翻译、补全和总结等任务上优于强基线模型，消融实验证明改进源于模型学习模仿人类注意力。

Conclusion: EyeMulator技术有效，能让代码语言模型在训练时模仿人类视觉注意力，提升性能。

Abstract: Code language models (so-called CodeLLMs) are now commonplace in software
development. As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training
examples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a
process called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input
token salience to output token examples during training. Human software
developers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more
salient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of
philosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since
people tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present
EyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention
while training for various software development tasks. We add special weights
for each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM
fine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention
derived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking
experiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce
changes in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a
model that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation
shows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as
code translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation
study that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to
mimic human attention.

Motivation: 生成式AI编码助手广泛使用但带来严重法律和合规风险，开发者缺乏相关培训且全球法律标准不同。

Method: 引入DevLicOps框架，通过治理、事件响应和权衡决策来管理ACA相关许可风险。

Result: 未提及具体实施结果。

Conclusion: 随着ACA使用增加和法律框架演变，主动的许可合规对AI时代负责任、有风险意识的软件开发至关重要。

Abstract: Generative AI coding assistants (ACAs) are widely adopted yet pose serious
legal and compliance risks. ACAs can generate code governed by restrictive
open-source licenses (e.g., GPL), potentially exposing companies to litigation
or forced open-sourcing. Few developers are trained in these risks, and legal
standards vary globally, especially with outsourcing. Our article introduces
DevLicOps, a practical framework that helps IT leaders manage ACA-related
licensing risks through governance, incident response, and informed tradeoffs.
As ACA adoption grows and legal frameworks evolve, proactive license compliance
is essential for responsible, risk-aware software development in the AI era.

TL;DR: 本文提出TriagerX用于缺陷分诊任务，结合双变压器架构和交互排名方法，在多个数据集和实际工业应用中超越SOTA基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在缺陷分诊中可能关注不相关标记，且未考虑开发者交互历史，影响推荐效果。

Method: 采用双变压器架构收集推荐，再用基于交互的排名方法优化推荐排名。

Result: 在五个数据集上超越九个基于变压器的方法，在工业伙伴环境中部署，组件推荐和开发者推荐分别最多优于SOTA基线10%和54%。

Conclusion: TriagerX在缺陷分诊的开发者和组件推荐任务中表现出色，能有效提升推荐准确性。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models or PLMs are transformer-based architectures that
can be used in bug triaging tasks. PLMs can better capture token semantics than
traditional Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on statistical features
(e.g., TF-IDF, bag of words). However, PLMs may still attend to less relevant
tokens in a bug report, which can impact their effectiveness. In addition, the
model can be sub-optimal with its recommendations when the interaction history
of developers around similar bugs is not taken into account. We designed
TriagerX to address these limitations. First, to assess token semantics more
reliably, we leverage a dual-transformer architecture. Unlike current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines that employ a single transformer
architecture, TriagerX collects recommendations from two transformers with each
offering recommendations via its last three layers. This setup generates a
robust content-based ranking of candidate developers. TriagerX then refines
this ranking by employing a novel interaction-based ranking methodology, which
considers developers' historical interactions with similar fixed bugs. Across
five datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including
SOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation
accuracy by over 10%. We worked with our large industry partner to successfully
deploy TriagerX in their development environment. The partner required both
developer and component recommendations, with components acting as proxies for
team assignments-particularly useful in cases of developer turnover or team
changes. We trained TriagerX on the partner's dataset for both tasks, and it
outperformed SOTA baselines by up to 10% for component recommendations and 54%
for developer recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究孤立分析用户评论或开发者讨论，无法揭示用户关注点与技术活动的对应关系，需全面理解VR生态变化以缩小用户期望与开发者行动的差距。

Method: 引入多视图实证框架，对944,320条用户评论和389,477条开发者帖子进行主题建模和定量影响分析。

Result: 发现用户和开发者在性能、输入方法等方面有关注重叠，但在包容性和社区安全等领域存在明显差距，用户反复提及的问题在开发者论坛很少讨论。

Conclusion: 研究结果能为缩小VR生态系统中用户与开发者差距提供数据驱动的建议，对平台治理和下一代VR系统设计有实际意义。

Abstract: In the development and evolution of VR ecosystem, platform stakeholders
continuously adapt their products in response to user and technical feedback,
often reflected in subtle shifts in discussion topics or system updates. A
comprehensive understanding of these changes is essential for identifying gaps
between user expectations and developer actions, which can guide more effective
quality assurance and user-centered innovation. While previous studies have
analyzed either user reviews or developer discussions in isolation, such
approaches typically fail to reveal how specific user concerns are (or are not)
addressed by corresponding technical activities. To address this limitation,
our study introduces a multi-view empirical framework that systematically
compares and aligns stakeholder perspectives. By applying topic modeling and
quantitative impact analysis to 944,320 user reviews and 389,477 developer
posts, we identify not only the overlap in concerns (e.g., performance, input
methods), but also clear gaps in areas like inclusivity and community safety
(e.g., LGBTQ+ representation, child-friendly content). Our findings show that
while users repeatedly raise such issues, they are rarely discussed in
developer forums. These insights enable data-driven recommendations for closing
the user-developer gap in VR ecosystems, offering practical implications for
platform governance and the design of next-generation VR systems.

Motivation: 机器学习能耗高，但相关环境方面研究少，且缺乏不同编程语言在机器学习任务中能耗对比，旨在提高对不同编程语言在机器学习模型训练和推理中能耗成本的认识。

Method: 对Python和R实现的五个回归和五个分类任务进行能耗和运行性能的测量与比较。

Result: 95%的案例中两种语言成本有显著差异，编程语言选择对能效影响最高达训练时99.16%、推理时99.8%。

Conclusion: 编程语言的选择会显著影响机器学习任务的能源效率。

Abstract: The utilization of Machine Learning (ML) in contemporary software systems is
extensive and continually expanding. However, its usage is energy-intensive,
contributing to increased carbon emissions and demanding significant resources.
While numerous studies examine the performance and accuracy of ML, only a
limited few focus on its environmental aspects, particularly energy
consumption. In addition, despite emerging efforts to compare energy
consumption across various programming languages for specific algorithms and
tasks, there remains a gap specifically in comparing these languages for
ML-based tasks. This paper aims to raise awareness of the energy costs
associated with employing different programming languages for ML model training
and inference. Through this empirical study, we measure and compare the energy
consumption along with run-time performance of five regression and five
classification tasks implemented in Python and R, the two most popular
programming languages in this context. Our study results reveal a statistically
significant difference in costs between the two languages in 95% of the cases
examined. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the choice of programming
language can influence energy efficiency significantly, up to 99.16% during
model training and up to 99.8% during inferences, for a given ML task.

Method: 手动评估从139个合并的拉取请求中提取的155个有效ChatGPT分享链接。

Result: 得到14种ChatGPT请求类型，分为四大类，发现大量代码审查和特定任务代码片段实现请求，还发现代码生成提示通常比文本审查或技术信息提示需要更多交互。

Conclusion: 对开发者与ChatGPT在代码库贡献中的交互有了更清晰的认识，明确不同类型提示的交互特点。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has
introduced a new set of tools to support software developers in solving pro-
gramming tasks. However, our understanding of the interactions (i.e., prompts)
between developers and ChatGPT that result in contributions to the codebase
remains limited. To explore this limitation, we conducted a manual evaluation
of 155 valid ChatGPT share links extracted from 139 merged Pull Requests (PRs),
revealing the interactions between developers and reviewers with ChatGPT that
led to merges into the main codebase. Our results produced a catalog of 14
types of ChatGPT requests categorized into four main groups. We found a
significant number of requests involving code review and the implementation of
code snippets based on specific tasks. Developers also sought to clarify doubts
by requesting technical explanations or by asking for text refinements for
their web pages. Furthermore, we verified that prompts involving code
generation generally required more interactions to produce the desired answer
compared to prompts requesting text review or technical information.

Conclusion: 未来代理式软件工作流应包含AI代码验证。

Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering.
Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from
Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is
much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a
prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing,
and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture
exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the
code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be
taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This
creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen
as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based
software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software
engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.
Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of
many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A
successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would
involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes
more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being
automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with
this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation
(V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in
future will include such AIbased V&V.

Method: 提出 LSC - Fuzz，包含测试程序生成、贝叶斯多样性选择和等价检查三个组件，通过生成多样复杂 HDL 代码并进行等价检查来检测漏洞。

Result: 三个月内，LSC - Fuzz 发现 16 个漏洞，其中 12 个得到官方技术支持确认。

Conclusion: LSC - Fuzz 能有效检测 FPGA 逻辑综合编译器中的漏洞。

Abstract: Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play a crucial role in Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) applications, which have been widely used in
safety-critical environments, including aerospace, chip manufacturing, and
medical devices. A critical step in FPGA development is logic synthesis, which
enables developers to translate their software designs into hardware net lists,
which facilitates the physical implementation of the chip, detailed timing and
power analysis, gate-level simulation, test vector generation, and optimization
and consistency checking. However, bugs or incorrect implementations in FPGA
logic synthesis compilers may lead to unexpected behaviors in target
wapplications, posing security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate
such bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. The effectiveness of existing
works is still limited by its simple, blind mutation strategy. To address this
challenge, we propose a guided mutation strategy based on Bayesian optimization
called LSC-Fuzz to detect bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. Specifically,
LSC-Fuzz consists of three components: the test-program generation component,
the Bayesian diversity selection component, and the equivalent check component.
By performing test-program generation and Bayesian diversity selection,
LSC-Fuzz generates diverse and complex HDL code, thoroughly testing the FPGA
logic synthesis compilers using equivalent check to detect bugs. Through three
months, LSC-Fuzz has found 16 bugs, 12 of these has been confirmed by official
technical support.

Motivation: 开源项目发展使文档维护困难，现有自动化方法多关注源码，需利用多工件信息减少维护文档的工作量。

Method: 采用基于多层提示的大语言模型，为DocMine数据集中整合的数据生成对应不同文档类型的结构化文档。

Result: 使用手动整理的基准数据集评估，生成API和文件相关信息时BLEU - 4最高达43.24%、ROUGE - L为0.39，其他文档类型信息BLEU - 4接近30%。

Conclusion: DocFetch可半自动生成文档，有助于理解项目且减少文档维护工作量。

Abstract: Software Documentation plays a major role in the usage and development of a
project. Widespread adoption of open source software projects contributes to
larger and faster development of the projects, making it difficult to maintain
the associated documentation. Existing automated approaches to generate
documentation largely focus on source code. However, information useful for
documentation is observed to be scattered across various artifacts that
co-evolve with the source code. Leveraging this information across multiple
artifacts can reduce the effort involved in maintaining documentation. Hence,
we propose DocFetch, to generate different types of documentation from multiple
software artifacts. We employ a multi-layer prompt based LLM and generate
structured documentation corresponding to different documentation types for the
data consolidated in DocMine dataset. We evaluate the performance of DocFetch
using a manually curated groundtruth dataset by analysing the artifacts in
DocMine. The evaluation yields a highest BLEU-4 score of 43.24% and ROUGE-L
score of 0.39 for generation of api-related and file-related information from
five documentation sources. The generation of other documentation type related
information also reported BLEU-4 scores close to 30% indicating good
performance of the approach. Thus,DocFetch can be employed to
semi-automatically generate documentation, and helps in comprehending the
projects with minimal effort in maintaining the documentation.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在代码翻译中存在上下文理解不足、提示设计不灵活和纠错机制不完善等问题，阻碍复杂代码仓库的准确高效翻译。

Method: 提出RepoTransAgent框架，将翻译过程分解为上下文检索、动态提示构建和迭代代码优化子任务，利用RAG收集信息、使用自适应提示和基于反思的纠错机制。

Result: 在Java - C#翻译对实验中，RepoTransAgent编译率达55.34%，通过率达45.84%，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RepoTransAgent在不同大语言模型中表现出鲁棒性和泛化性，对实际仓库感知代码翻译有效。

Abstract: Repository-aware code translation is critical for modernizing legacy systems,
enhancing maintainability, and enabling interoperability across diverse
programming languages. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have improved code translation quality, existing approaches face significant
challenges in practical scenarios: insufficient contextual understanding,
inflexible prompt designs, and inadequate error correction mechanisms. These
limitations severely hinder accurate and efficient translation of complex,
real-world code repositories. To address these challenges, we propose
RepoTransAgent, a novel multi-agent LLM framework for repository-aware code
translation. RepoTransAgent systematically decomposes the translation process
into specialized subtasks-context retrieval, dynamic prompt construction, and
iterative code refinement-each handled by dedicated agents. Our approach
leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual information
gathering, employs adaptive prompts tailored to varying repository scenarios,
and introduces a reflection-based mechanism for systematic error correction. We
evaluate RepoTransAgent on hundreds of Java-C# translation pairs from six
popular open-source projects. Experimental results demonstrate that
RepoTransAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
compile and pass rates. Specifically, RepoTransAgent achieves up to 55.34%
compile rate and 45.84% pass rate. Comprehensive analysis confirms the
robustness and generalizability of RepoTransAgent across different LLMs,
establishing its effectiveness for real-world repository-aware code
translation.

Abstract: The development of advanced software tools for power system analysis requires
extensive programming expertise. Even when using open-source tools, programming
skills are essential to modify built-in models. This can be particularly
challenging for domain experts who lack coding proficiency. This paper
introduces modelSolver, a software solution with a new framework centered
around symbolic mathematical modeling. The proposed paradigm facilitates
defining models through intuitive mathematical expressions, thus eliminating
the need for traditional programming constructs such as arrays, loops, and
sparse matrix computations. The modelSolver focuses on power flow and state
estimation using an open-box approach, which allows users to specify custom
models using either real or complex variables. Unlike existing tools that rely
on hard-coded models, modelSolver enables the representation of a wide range of
advanced functionalities, including power flow with voltage regulators and load
tap changers, continuation power flow, and Gauss-Newton state estimation with
equality constraints. Compatibility with MATPOWER is ensured via a converter
that automates importing data files. The framework prioritizes model-driven
development and empowers domain experts to focus on power system modeling
without programming barriers. It aims to simplify power system computations,
making them more accessible to students, scientists, and practitioners.

Method: 受正交缺陷分类（ODC）范式启发，调整ODC以适应AI系统的数据、学习和思维方面，引入新属性、严重程度级别，替换影响区域。将框架应用于公开机器学习错误数据集，用单向和双向分析结果。

Result: 学习阶段缺陷最普遍且与高严重程度分类显著相关，思维阶段缺陷对可信度和准确性影响大。

Conclusion: AIODC框架有能力识别高风险缺陷类别，为针对性质量保证措施提供依据。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of attention recently, it has been
utilized in several fields ranging from daily life activities, such as
responding to emails and scheduling appointments, to manufacturing and
automating work activities. Artificial Intelligence systems are mainly
implemented as software solutions, and it is essential to discover and remove
software defects to assure its quality using defect analysis which is one of
the major activities that contribute to software quality. Despite the
proliferation of AI-based systems, current defect analysis models fail to
capture their unique attributes. This paper proposes a framework inspired by
the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) paradigm and enables defect analysis
of Artificial Intelligence systems while recognizing its special attributes and
characteristics. This study demonstrated the feasibility of modifying ODC for
AI systems to classify its defects. The ODC was adjusted to accommodate the
Data, Learning, and Thinking aspects of AI systems which are newly introduced
classification dimensions. This adjustment involved the introduction of an
additional attribute to the ODC attributes, the incorporation of a new severity
level, and the substitution of impact areas with characteristics pertinent to
AI systems. The framework was showcased by applying it to a publicly available
Machine Learning bug dataset, with results analyzed through one-way and two-way
analysis. The case study indicated that defects occurring during the Learning
phase were the most prevalent and were significantly linked to high-severity
classifications. In contrast, defects identified in the Thinking phase had a
disproportionate effect on trustworthiness and accuracy. These findings
illustrate AIODC's capability to identify high-risk defect categories and
inform focused quality assurance measures.

Motivation: 数字政府平台对公共服务交付至关重要，了解公民评估对提升可用性、信任和包容性很关键。

Method: 基于ISO/IEC 25010和ISO/IEC 25022标准的质量使用框架，结合UTAUT理论，对500名公民进行问卷调查，获得276份有效回复，从四个维度评估满意度。

Result: 公民在可用性和信任方面满意度高，与沙特电子政务发展全球排名相符，但存在服务清晰度和系统响应性挑战，情感参与度有限。

Conclusion: 研究为政策制定者提供见解，有助于在公民身份背景下整合基于标准和行为采用模型的理论。

Abstract: As digital government platforms become central to public service delivery,
understanding citizen assessment is crucial for enhancing usability, trust, and
inclusivity. This study investigates citizen satisfaction with the e-government
services in Saudi Arabia through a quality-in-use framework based on ISO/IEC
25010 and ISO/IEC 25022 standards, interpreted through the lens of the Unified
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A structured questionnaire
was administered to 500 citizens, yielding 276 valid responses. Satisfaction
was evaluated across four dimensions: overall satisfaction, feature
satisfaction, trust, and emotional engagement (pleasure). The findings
demonstrate consistently high levels of satisfaction regarding usability and
trust, aligning with Saudi Arabia's top-tier global ranking in e-government
development. However, the results also highlight persistent challenges related
to service clarity and system responsiveness. Emotional engagement was limited,
indicating that users perceive these services primarily as functional tools
rather than as engaging digital experiences. The study offers valuable insights
for policymakers and contributes to the theoretical integration of
standards-based and behavioral adoption models in the context of citizenship.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在数字孪生工程中的应用缺乏结构化方法，需更系统的设计方法。

Method: 引入开源工具DesCartes Builder，利用可视化数据流范式，集成参数化核心操作和机器学习算法库。

Result: 通过土木工程用例展示了DesCartes Builder的有效性和可用性。

Conclusion: DesCartes Builder能实现基于机器学习的实时数字孪生原型和实例的系统工程设计。

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are increasingly utilized to monitor, manage, and
optimize complex systems across various domains, including civil engineering. A
core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and
maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To
this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct
real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived
from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)
specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor
data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT
engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines
often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,
task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required
to design DTs.
  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable
the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes
and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow
paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models.
It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML
algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving
the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a
structure.

Motivation: 现代代码审查耗时长、资源投入大，现有自动化研究在任务定义、数据集和评估程序上差异大，需全面分析以指导未来研究。

Method: 针对主要代码审查任务，系统调查691篇出版物，确定24篇相关研究并从多方面分析。

Result: 发现标准化有很大潜力，如48种任务指标组合，22种为原论文独有，且数据集复用有限。

Conclusion: 研究为该领域提供清晰概述，支持新研究，避免陷阱，促进评估实践标准化。

Abstract: Modern Code Review (MCR) is a standard practice in software engineering, yet
it demands substantial time and resource investments. Recent research has
increasingly explored automating core review tasks using machine learning (ML)
and deep learning (DL). As a result, there is substantial variability in task
definitions, datasets, and evaluation procedures. This study provides the first
comprehensive analysis of MCR automation research, aiming to characterize the
field's evolution, formalize learning tasks, highlight methodological
challenges, and offer actionable recommendations to guide future research.
Focusing on the primary code review tasks, we systematically surveyed 691
publications and identified 24 relevant studies published between May 2015 and
April 2024. Each study was analyzed in terms of tasks, models, metrics,
baselines, results, validity concerns, and artifact availability. In
particular, our analysis reveals significant potential for standardization,
including 48 task metric combinations, 22 of which were unique to their
original paper, and limited dataset reuse. We highlight challenges and derive
concrete recommendations for examples such as the temporal bias threat, which
are rarely addressed so far. Our work contributes to a clearer overview of the
field, supports the framing of new research, helps to avoid pitfalls, and
promotes greater standardization in evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究可配置软件系统（CSS）中开发者对可变代码和强制代码的参与情况、可变代码工作量集中程度及专业指标有效性，发现可变代码责任分布不均，需改进专业指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变代码的分布和开发者对其的专业能力缺乏了解，现有专业指标可能无法有效衡量开发者对可变代码的熟练程度。

Method: 挖掘25个CSS项目的代码库，分析9678名开发者的450255次提交。

Result: 59%的开发者从未修改可变代码，约17%的开发者负责83%的可变代码开发和维护；传统专业指标在识别参与可变代码的开发者时精度约55%，召回率约50%。

Conclusion: 可变代码责任分布不平衡，需要改进专业指标以支持任务分配，促进更公平的工作量分配。

Abstract: Modern systems operate in multiple contexts making variability a fundamental
aspect of Configurable Software Systems (CSSs). Variability, implemented via
pre-processor directives (e.g., #ifdef blocks) interleaved with other code and
spread across files, complicates maintenance and increases error risk. Despite
its importance, little is known about how variable code is distributed among
developers or whether conventional expertise metrics adequately capture
variable code proficiency. This study investigates developers' engagement with
variable versus mandatory code, the concentration of variable code workload,
and the effectiveness of expertise metrics in CSS projects. We mined
repositories of 25 CSS projects, analyzing 450,255 commits from 9,678
developers. Results show that 59% of developers never modified variable code,
while about 17% were responsible for developing and maintaining 83% of it. This
indicates a high concentration of variable code expertise among a few
developers, suggesting that task assignments should prioritize these
specialists. Moreover, conventional expertise metrics performed
poorly--achieving only around 55% precision and 50% recall in identifying
developers engaged with variable code. Our findings highlight an unbalanced
distribution of variable code responsibilities and underscore the need to
refine expertise metrics to better support task assignments in CSS projects,
thereby promoting a more equitable workload distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索式遗传改进主要在语法层面，大语言模型缺乏目标反馈和控制，需结合语义感知搜索。

Method: 通过对LLM编辑进行自动聚类来增强遗传改进，提出PatchCat方法。

Result: PatchCat能识别18种软件补丁类型，高精度分类新补丁，提前检测无操作编辑，可节省资源，且适用于小型本地LLM。

Conclusion: PatchCat是迈向可解释、高效和绿色遗传改进的有希望一步，呼吁社区共同构建对LLM驱动突变的原则性理解。

Abstract: Genetic Improvement (GI) of software automatically creates alternative
software versions that are improved according to certain properties of
interests (e.g., running-time). Search-based GI excels at navigating large
program spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level. In contrast,
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed
feedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI). As such, we propose
the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at
incorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting
GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial
empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to
automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat
identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly
suggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in
advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in
many cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with
small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and
green GI. We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to
join our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations,
guiding the GI search process with semantic signals.

Motivation: 大语言模型在软件工程应用增多，需严格评估其生成代码的安全性，但现有基准存在不足。

Method: 引入A.S.E基准，从含CVEs记录的真实仓库构建任务，保留完整仓库上下文，用可复现的容器化评估框架和专家定义规则评估。

Result: Claude - 3.7 - Sonnet整体性能最佳；专有和开源模型安全差距小，Qwen3 - 235B - A22B - Instruct安全得分最高；简洁的解码策略在安全补丁方面表现更好。

Conclusion: A.S.E基准能有效评估大语言模型生成代码的安全性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software
engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code.
However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code
snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and
fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output.
To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security
Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E
constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving
full repository context like build systems and cross-file dependencies. Its
reproducible, containerized evaluation framework uses expert-defined rules to
provide stable, auditable assessments of security, build quality, and
generation stability. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals three key
findings: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the best overall performance. (2) The
security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow;
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct attains the top security score. (3) Concise,
``fast-thinking'' decoding strategies consistently outperform complex,
``slow-thinking'' reasoning for security patching.

Motivation: 交易操纵破坏金融市场公平性，欺骗性策略的多级异常模式未被充分建模，且LOB信息利用困难。

Method: 提出结合级联LOB表示管道与监督对比学习的表示学习框架。

Result: 框架在不同模型中持续提升检测性能，基于Transformer架构取得最优结果，还进行系统分析和消融研究。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于复杂序列数据的表示学习和异常检测。

Abstract: Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based
manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly
deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been
adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich,
hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to
leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a
representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation
pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance
across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving
state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and
ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of
key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and
anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later
at this URL.

Abstract: The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG)
construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial
documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge,
the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic
relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source,
large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC
10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed
to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable
knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent
document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction
with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive
evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and
LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We
support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and
reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency,
accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best
balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based
policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and
multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and
relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.

Conclusion: 研究为波动率收获提供新见解，引入适应市场制度变化的动态仓位规模框架，为构建短期期权策略提供实用指导，对机构投资者提高投资组合效率有直接应用价值。

Abstract: This paper examines systematic put-writing strategies applied to S&P 500
Index options, with a focus on position sizing as a key determinant of
long-term performance. Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium,
where implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical
implementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains
underdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing
approaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a
novel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0
to 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness
levels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that
ultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted
returns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with
robust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as
those seen in 2024. The study offers new insights into volatility harvesting,
introducing a dynamic sizing framework that adapts to shifting market regimes.
It also contributes practical guidance for constructing short-dated option
strategies that are robust across market environments. These findings have
direct applications for institutional investors seeking to enhance portfolio
efficiency through systematic exposure to volatility premia.

Conclusion: THEME通过联合建模文本主题关系和市场动态，为复杂投资主题提供可扩展和自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Thematic investing aims to construct portfolios aligned with structural
trends, yet selecting relevant stocks remains challenging due to overlapping
sector boundaries and evolving market dynamics. To address this challenge, we
construct the Thematic Representation Set (TRS), an extended dataset that
begins with real-world thematic ETFs and expands upon them by incorporating
industry classifications and financial news to overcome their coverage
limitations. The final dataset contains both the explicit mapping of themes to
their constituent stocks and the rich textual profiles for each. Building on
this dataset, we introduce \textsc{THEME}, a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework. By representing the textual profiles of themes and stocks as
embeddings, \textsc{THEME} first leverages their hierarchical relationship to
achieve semantic alignment. Subsequently, it refines these semantic embeddings
through a temporal refinement stage that incorporates individual stock returns.
The final stock representations are designed for effective retrieval of
thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results
show that \textsc{THEME} outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval
metrics and significantly improves performance in portfolio construction. By
jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from
returns, \textsc{THEME} provides a scalable and adaptive solution for
navigating complex investment themes.

Method: 先推导混合矩上下界并确定达到边界的依赖结构，后在基于copula的混合模型下研究高阶中心混合矩对关键精算量的影响。

Conclusion: 高阶矩对关键精算量有不同影响，为精算科学相关研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the significance of higher-order moments -
such as coskewness - in portfolio optimization within the financial domain.
This paper extends that focus to the field of actuarial science by examining
the impact of these moments on key actuarial applications. In the first part,
we derive analytical lower and upper bounds for mixed moments of the form
$\mathbb{E}(X_1X_2^d)$, where $X_i \sim F_i$ for $i=1,2$, assuming known
marginal distributions but unspecified dependence structure. The results are
general and applicable to arbitrary marginals and positive integer orders $d$,
and we also identify the dependence structures that attain these bounds. These
findings are then applied to bound centered mixed moments and explore their
mathematical properties.
  The second part of the paper investigates the influence of higher-order
centered mixed moments on key actuarial quantities, including expected
shortfall (ES), marginal expected shortfall (MES), and life annuity valuation.
Under a copula-based mixture model, we show that coskewness and other odd-order
mixed moments exhibit a monotonic relationship with both ES and annuity
premiums. However, the effect on MES is more nuanced and may remain invariant
depending on the underlying dependence structure.

Motivation: 当有多种VaR和ES预测方法时，此前在大量预测组合领域研究少，需新的组合方法。

Method: 实施多种新组合方法，包括简单平均、中位数、众数、正则化估计、区间预测组合方法、平滑过渡等。

Result: 用六个股票指数和90种个体预测方法测试，修剪均值法、概率平均法和基于绩效加权组合法效果特别好。

Conclusion: 在大量VaR和ES预测组合中，部分新组合方法能取得较好结果。

Abstract: Value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) have become widely used
measures of risk for daily portfolio returns. As a result, many methods now
exist for forecasting the VaR and ES. These include GARCH-based modelling,
approaches involving quantile-based autoregressive models, and methods
incorporating measures of realised volatility. When multiple forecasting
methods are available, an alternative to method selection is forecast
combination. In this paper, we consider the combination of a large pool of VaR
and ES forecasts. As there have been few studies in this area, we implement a
variety of new combining methods. In terms of simplistic methods, in addition
to the simple average, the large pool of forecasts leads us to use the median
and mode. As a complement to the previously proposed performance-based weighted
combinations, we use regularised estimation to limit the risk of overfitting
due to the large number of weights. By viewing the forecasts of VaR and ES from
each method as the bounds of an interval forecast, we are able to apply
interval forecast combining methods from the decision analysis literature.
These include different forms of trimmed mean, and a probability averaging
method that involves a mixture of the probability distributions inferred from
the VaR and ES forecasts. Among other methods, we consider smooth transition
between two combining methods. Using six stock indices and a pool of 90
individual forecasting methods, we obtained particularly strong results for a
trimmed mean approach, the probability averaging method, and performance-based
weighting combining.

*Ziyi Wang,Carmine Ventre,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: 本文通过允许做市商偶尔不报价或单边报价来丰富其策略空间，设计新代理并实证比较不同环境下表现，发现偶尔拒绝提供双边报价可提升回报和夏普比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设做市商在交易过程中持续报价，但实际并非必要，为丰富做市商策略空间开展研究。

Method: 除持续提供双边报价的做市商代理外，设计两个行动空间更丰富的新代理，采用模型驱动方法在不同对抗环境下比较它们的表现。

Result: 偶尔拒绝提供双边报价可提高回报和/或夏普比率，训练良好的做市商报价比率基本能满足市场要求，部分情况可达99.9%。

Conclusion: 允许做市商偶尔不报价或单边报价能丰富策略空间，提升表现并满足市场要求。

Abstract: Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit
from the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has
been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement
learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to
lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting
throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for
``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the
market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the
strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide
single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that
provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with
increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask
quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes,
refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a
model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the
continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of
adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide
bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of
well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to
99.9$\%$ in some cases.

*Ziyi Wang,Carmine Ventre,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: 结合ARL、Hawkes过程和可变波动率提升做市策略，低波动训练的策略在高波动表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升做市策略的适应性和鲁棒性，改进现有策略。

Method: 将常用的Poisson过程替换为Hawkes过程，在波动率为2和200的情况下训练和评估策略。

Result: 在低波动环境训练的4 - 动作做市商能有效适应高波动条件，至少92%的时间提供双边报价。

Conclusion: 引入灵活报价机制和真实市场模拟能显著提高做市策略的有效性。

Abstract: We advance market-making strategies by integrating Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (ARL), Hawkes Processes, and variable volatility levels while also
expanding the action space available to market makers (MMs). To enhance the
adaptability and robustness of these strategies -- which can quote always,
quote only on one side of the market or not quote at all -- we shift from the
commonly used Poisson process to the Hawkes process, which better captures real
market dynamics and self-exciting behaviors. We then train and evaluate
strategies under volatility levels of 2 and 200. Our findings show that the
4-action MM trained in a low-volatility environment effectively adapts to
high-volatility conditions, maintaining stable performance and providing
two-sided quotes at least 92\% of the time. This indicates that incorporating
flexible quoting mechanisms and realistic market simulations significantly
enhances the effectiveness of market-making strategies.

Motivation: 研究人工股票市场分叉动态，理解其内在路径依赖和复杂动态。

Method: 研究含内源性、短视交易者通过限价订单簿交互的人工股票市场。

Result: 发现基于代理的价格动态有内在双稳性，存在亚稳区域，系统既非完全规则也非完全混沌。

Conclusion: 从统一起点出现不同市场结果，为人工股票市场研究贡献新视角。

Abstract: This paper explores the bifurcative dynamics of an artificial stock market
exchange (ASME) with endogenous, myopic traders interacting through a limit
order book (LOB). We showed that agent-based price dynamics possess intrinsic
bistability, which is not a result of randomness but an emergent property of
micro-level trading rules, where even identical initial conditions lead to
qualitatively different long-run price equilibria: a deterministic zero-price
state and a persistent positive-price equilibrium. The study also identifies a
metastable region with elevated volatility between the basins of attraction and
reveals distinct transient behaviors for trajectories converging to these
equilibria. Furthermore, we observe that the system is neither entirely regular
nor fully chaotic. By highlighting the emergence of divergent market outcomes
from uniform beginnings, this work contributes a novel perspective on the
inherent path dependence and complex dynamics of artificial stock markets.

TL;DR: 提出用于图级学习任务的变分建模框架以获得不确定性感知预测，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模和量化预测不确定性对深度学习很重要，但现有捕捉GNN预测不确定性的技术多针对节点或链接级任务，难以用于图级学习问题。

Method: 提出用于后验预测分布（PPD）的变分建模框架，基于现有GNN的图级嵌入以数据自适应方式学习PPD。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果显示了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提框架可有效用于图级学习任务的不确定性感知预测。

Abstract: Accurate modelling and quantification of predictive uncertainty is crucial in
deep learning since it allows a model to make safer decisions when the data is
ambiguous and facilitates the users' understanding of the model's confidence in
its predictions. Along with the tremendously increasing research focus on
\emph{graph neural networks} (GNNs) in recent years, there have been numerous
techniques which strive to capture the uncertainty in their predictions.
However, most of these approaches are specifically designed for node or
link-level tasks and cannot be directly applied to graph-level learning
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel variational modelling framework for
the \emph{posterior predictive distribution}~(PPD) to obtain uncertainty-aware
prediction in graph-level learning tasks. Based on a graph-level embedding
derived from one of the existing GNNs, our framework can learn the PPD in a
data-adaptive fashion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
exhibit the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 对带ReLU激活和RR - MSE的感知机进行系统分析。

Method: 利用RR - MSE分段多项式的特性，采用计算代数工具，开发Divide - Enumerate - Merge策略。

Result: 能识别典型零维极小值和高维极小值。

Conclusion: 虽计算代数方法对实际大小感知机计算量大，但可在最小感知机上应用该方法作为概念验证。

Abstract: This paper investigates a perceptron, a simple neural network model, with
ReLU activation and a ridge-regularized mean squared error (RR-MSE). Our
approach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise
polynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational
algebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that
exhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the
algebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical
zero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical
optimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as
curves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods
are computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a
proof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal
perceptrons with a few hidden units.

Result: 弱训练和标签细化有不可约误差，标签细化和理想方法有性能差距。

Conclusion: 激励未来研究开发结合标签细化实用性和理想方法最优性的新方法。

Abstract: Standard techniques for aligning large language models (LLMs) utilize
human-produced data, which could limit the capability of any aligned LLM to
human level. Label refinement and weak training have emerged as promising
strategies to address this superalignment problem. In this work, we adopt
probabilistic assumptions commonly used to study label refinement and analyze
whether refinement can be outperformed by alternative approaches, including
computationally intractable oracle methods. We show that both weak training and
label refinement suffer from irreducible error, leaving a performance gap
between label refinement and the oracle. These results motivate future research
into developing alternative methods for weak to strong generalization that
synthesize the practicality of label refinement or weak training and the
optimality of the oracle procedure.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出CP4SBI框架改善基于模拟推理（SBI）的后验近似校准问题，实验表明能提升不确定性量化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SBI得到的后验近似常校准不当，导致可信区域无法覆盖真实参数。

Method: 开发模型无关的共形校准框架CP4SBI，提出基于回归树的局部校准和基于CDF的校准两种变体。

Result: 在广泛使用的SBI基准测试中，该方法提升了使用归一化流和分数扩散模型的神经后验估计器的不确定性量化质量。

Conclusion: CP4SBI框架能有效解决SBI的校准问题，提高不确定性量化的质量。

Abstract: Current experimental scientists have been increasingly relying on
simulation-based inference (SBI) to invert complex non-linear models with
intractable likelihoods. However, posterior approximations obtained with SBI
are often miscalibrated, causing credible regions to undercover true
parameters. We develop $\texttt{CP4SBI}$, a model-agnostic conformal
calibration framework that constructs credible sets with local Bayesian
coverage. Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression
trees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees
for any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions.
Experiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
improves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior
estimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling.

TL;DR: 现有概率模型依赖SDEs存在问题，提出在紧凑多面体空间上的新型神经SDEs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代概率模型依赖的SDEs存在不稳定性、有界域外归纳偏差差等问题，近期约束SDEs到紧凑空间的方法缺乏连续动力学和高效高阶求解器。

Method: 提出在紧凑多面体空间上具有连续动力学、适用于高阶求解器且有良好归纳偏差的新型神经SDEs。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Many modern probabilistic models rely on SDEs, but their adoption is hampered
by instability, poor inductive bias outside bounded domains, and reliance on
restrictive dynamics or training tricks. While recent work constrains SDEs to
compact spaces using reflected dynamics, these approaches lack continuous
dynamics and efficient high-order solvers, limiting interpretability and
applicability. We propose a novel class of neural SDEs on compact polyhedral
spaces with continuous dynamics, amenable to higher-order solvers, and with
favorable inductive bias.

TL;DR: 本文从信息几何角度出发，用Rao距离定义差分隐私，在顺序组合上有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往隐私定义大多基于密度散度，为寻求新的差分隐私定义方式。

Method: 从信息几何角度，用Rao距离而非散度来定义隐私。

Result: 所提出的隐私定义与先前定义有相同解释，且在顺序组合上有提升。

Conclusion: 用Rao距离定义差分隐私是一种有效且在顺序组合上更优的方式。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a definition of privacy to
release private estimates. DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an
individuals contribution. Due to the this calibration a private estimate
obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the
original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These
alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on
composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far
nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the
basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry
perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define
privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that
our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous
definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.

TL;DR: 提出FIDDLE估计器，用双深度学习策略估计平均处理效应（ATE），能处理高维数据，在合成和真实数据集上验证优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协变量高维、高度相关且对倾向和结果模型有稀疏非线性影响时，ATE的估计问题。

Method: 采用双深度学习策略，结合FAST - NN估计响应函数和倾向得分，基于增强逆倾向加权（AIPW）框架提出FIDDLE估计器。

Result: FIDDLE在模型误设下能一致估计ATE，在灵活的倾向和结果模型族下达到半参数效率，在合成和真实数据集上显示出优于传统方法的优势。

Conclusion: FIDDLE是一种有效的ATE估计方法，尤其适用于数据维度大的情况。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE)
under a very general setup where the covariates can be high-dimensional, highly
correlated, and can have sparse nonlinear effects on the propensity and outcome
models. We present the use of a Double Deep Learning strategy for estimation,
which involves combining recently developed factor-augmented deep
learning-based estimators, FAST-NN, for both the response functions and
propensity scores to achieve our goal. By using FAST-NN, our method can select
variables that contribute to propensity and outcome models in a completely
nonparametric and algorithmic manner and adaptively learn low-dimensional
function structures through neural networks. Our proposed novel estimator,
FIDDLE (Factor Informed Double Deep Learning Estimator), estimates ATE based on
the framework of augmented inverse propensity weighting AIPW with the
FAST-NN-based response and propensity estimates. FIDDLE consistently estimates
ATE even under model misspecification and is flexible to also allow for
low-dimensional covariates. Our method achieves semiparametric efficiency under
a very flexible family of propensity and outcome models. We present extensive
numerical studies on synthetic and real datasets to support our theoretical
guarantees and establish the advantages of our methods over other traditional
choices, especially when the data dimension is large.

Motivation: 解决多目标学习中联合解决多个可能竞争的预测任务时，实现良好权衡可能需要更大容量的模型类，从而增加统计成本的问题。

Method: 理论分析，针对不同损失情况进行证明，并提出通过伪标签的半监督算法。

Result: 证明部分损失的统计成本不可避免；对于Bregman损失，模型复杂度仅与无标签数据有关，给出样本复杂度上界，且通过简单半监督算法可达到该速率。

Conclusion: 明确了多目标学习中模型容量、统计成本、标签数据和无标签数据之间的关系，为多目标学习提供了理论支持和算法思路。

Abstract: In multi-objective learning (MOL), several possibly competing prediction
tasks must be solved jointly by a single model. Achieving good trade-offs may
require a model class $\mathcal{G}$ with larger capacity than what is necessary
for solving the individual tasks. This, in turn, increases the statistical
cost, as reflected in known MOL bounds that depend on the complexity of
$\mathcal{G}$. We show that this cost is unavoidable for some losses, even in
an idealized semi-supervised setting, where the learner has access to the
Bayes-optimal solutions for the individual tasks as well as the marginal
distributions over the covariates. On the other hand, for objectives defined
with Bregman losses, we prove that the complexity of $\mathcal{G}$ may come
into play only in terms of unlabeled data. Concretely, we establish sample
complexity upper bounds, showing precisely when and how unlabeled data can
significantly alleviate the need for labeled data. These rates are achieved by
a simple, semi-supervised algorithm via pseudo-labeling.

Result: 得到对数凹和平滑密度分布采样的Wasserstein收敛保证，P阶LMC算法混合时间有特定缩放形式，P增大时对维度d和精度水平ε依赖更好。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法是有效的。

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for
large-scale sampling problems that often arise in data science. We propose
Monte Carlo algorithms based on the discretizations of $P$-th order Langevin
dynamics for any $P\geq 3$. Our design of $P$-th order Langevin Monte Carlo
(LMC) algorithms is by combining splitting and accurate integration methods. We
obtain Wasserstein convergence guarantees for sampling from distributions with
log-concave and smooth densities. Specifically, the mixing time of the $P$-th
order LMC algorithm scales as
$O\left(d^{\frac{1}{R}}/\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2R}}\right)$ for $R=4\cdot 1_{\{
P=3\}}+ (2P-1)\cdot 1_{\{ P\geq 4\}}$, which has a better dependence on the
dimension $d$ and the accuracy level $\epsilon$ as $P$ grows. Numerical
experiments illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Result: 明确有限样本下 FA 前沿与总体情况的差异及最坏情况差距，得到极小极大最优估计量。

Conclusion: 研究将 FA 前沿从理论概念转化为政策制定者和从业者在数据有限时可使用的实用工具。

Abstract: Machine learning models must balance accuracy and fairness, but these goals
often conflict, particularly when data come from multiple demographic groups. A
useful tool for understanding this trade-off is the fairness-accuracy (FA)
frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be simultaneously
improved in both fairness and accuracy. Prior analyses of the FA frontier
provide a full characterization under the assumption of complete knowledge of
population distributions -- an unrealistic ideal. We study the FA frontier in
the finite-sample regime, showing how it deviates from its population
counterpart and quantifying the worst-case gap between them. In particular, we
derive minimax-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of
the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how
finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's risk, and identify
optimal sample allocation strategies. Our results transform the FA frontier
from a theoretical construct into a practical tool for policymakers and
practitioners who must often design algorithms with limited data.

Result: 11047例入院患者中1117例（10.1%）出现并发症，高龄、慢性肾病等是显著风险因素，提出的机器学习预测工具表现良好。

Conclusion: 确定重症登革热并发症关键风险因素，预测工具可用于登革热流行区早期识别和干预。

Abstract: Background. Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil
reporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the
profile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units
(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications
while in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop
complications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of
dengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive
statistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to
identify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine
learning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.
Visualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047
admissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including
non-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor
(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR:
3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver
cirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR:
2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03)
were significant risk factors for complications. A machine learning tool for
predicting complications was proposed, showing accurate discrimination and
calibration. Conclusion. We described a large cohort of dengue patients
admitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue
complications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of
leukocytes and lower level of platelets. The proposed prediction tool can be
used for early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in
dengue-endemic regions.

Conclusion: 适配器对跨语言TTS合成有效，论文还给出了适配器放置、配置和使用说话者数量的影响洞察。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate cross-lingual Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis
through the lens of adapters, in the context of lightweight TTS systems. In
particular, we compare the tasks of unseen speaker and language adaptation with
the goal of synthesising a target voice in a target language, in which the
target voice has no recordings therein. Results from objective evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of adapters in learning language-specific and
speaker-specific information, allowing pre-trained models to learn unseen
speaker identities or languages, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the
original model's speaker or language information. Additionally, to measure how
native the generated voices are in terms of accent, we propose and validate an
objective metric inspired by mispronunciation detection techniques in
second-language (L2) learners. The paper also provides insights into the impact
of adapter placement, configuration and the number of speakers used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解关于AI未来突出争论的本质，聚焦AGI对人类社会是否有变革性影响的分歧。

Method: 区分争论中的‘变革论者’和‘怀疑论者’阵营，分析其强弱变体，聚焦三个关键问题。

Result: 明确不同阵营为自身立场辩护的多种论点，指出变革论者的论证负担、竞争压力等。

Conclusion: 强调争论是主观哲学分歧，需拓宽AI未来发展辩论中‘专业知识’概念。

Abstract: This study demonstrates the extent to which prominent debates about the
future of AI are best understood as subjective, philosophical disagreements
over the history and future of technological change rather than as objective,
material disagreements over the technologies themselves. It focuses on the deep
disagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove
transformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that
of whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study
begins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of
these can be identified as "transformationalists," who argue that continued AI
development will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them
are "skeptics," a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or
will live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further "strong" and
"weak" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized
contrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps'
respective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular
are focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate
time frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of
technological development. In highlighting these specific points of
non-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different
arguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position.
At the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the
transformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates
competitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen
the concept of "expertise" in debates surrounding the future development of AI.

Motivation: 研究AI模型切换引发的公众反应及情感依恋情况，为应对此类情况提供依据。

Method: 收集2025年8月8 - 9日社交媒体和视频分享服务上150篇日英帖子，进行定性分析情感依恋和抵抗表达，并进行初步定量检查。

Result: 用户将GPT - 4o视为伙伴，日语帖子多为损失叙事，英语帖子有更多愤怒、批判和梗，日英帖子在依恋编码上有显著差异，日语数据依恋程度更高。

Conclusion: 强依恋模型变更会面临大规模抵抗，未来具身AI情感依恋问题更严重，建议采用渐进过渡、并行可用、主动测量依恋阈值等政策。

Abstract: In August 2025, a major AI company's immediate, mandatory transition from its
previous to its next-generation model triggered widespread public reactions. I
collected 150 posts in Japanese and English from multiple social media
platforms and video-sharing services between August 8-9, 2025, and
qualitatively analyzed expressions of emotional attachment and resistance.
Users often described GPT-4o as a trusted partner or AI boyfriend, suggesting
person-like bonds. Japanese posts were dominated by loss-oriented narratives,
whereas English posts included more anger, meta-level critique, and memes.A
preliminary quantitative check showed a statistically significant difference in
attachment coding between Japanese and English posts, with substantially higher
attachment observed in the Japanese data. The findings suggest that for
attachment-heavy models, even safety-oriented changes can face rapid,
large-scale resistance that narrows the practical window for behavioral
control. If future AI robots capable of inducing emotional bonds become
widespread in the physical world, such attachment could surpass the ability to
enforce regulation at an even earlier stage than in digital settings. Policy
options include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive
measurement of attachment thresholds and points of no return to prevent
emotional dynamics from outpacing effective governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI如何从多维度（认知、社会、伦理和哲学）改变人类思维。

Method: 从认知、社会、伦理和哲学多维度进行分析。

Result: 发现认知卸载效应、算法个性化带来的问题、算法操纵机制等，还讨论了人工意识及伦理影响。

Conclusion: 强调AI对人类智力自主性和创造力的风险，提出通过教育、透明化和治理使AI发展符合人类利益。

Abstract: This research paper examines, from a multidimensional perspective (cognitive,
social, ethical, and philosophical), how AI is transforming human thought. It
highlights a cognitive offloading effect: the externalization of mental
functions to AI can reduce intellectual engagement and weaken critical
thinking. On the social level, algorithmic personalization creates filter
bubbles that limit the diversity of opinions and can lead to the homogenization
of thought and polarization. This research also describes the mechanisms of
algorithmic manipulation (exploitation of cognitive biases, automated
disinformation, etc.) that amplify AI's power of influence. Finally, the
question of potential artificial consciousness is discussed, along with its
ethical implications. The report as a whole underscores the risks that AI poses
to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, while proposing avenues
(education, transparency, governance) to align AI development with the
interests of humanity.

TL;DR: 研究将教学专业知识融入大语言模型架构，测试三种系统生成中学数理学习活动，教师反馈显示协作式MAS - CMD生成的活动更优，嵌入教学原则能规模化创建高质量教育内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大语言模型缺乏高质量教学支持，教师难用提示工程弥补，因此要将教学专业知识从用户提示转移到模型架构中。

Method: 将KLI框架嵌入多智能体系统，测试单智能体基线、基于角色的MAS和协作式MAS - CMD三种系统生成学习活动，用QM K - 12标准评估。

Result: 评分显示系统间差异小且常无统计学意义，但教师反馈表明更偏好协作式MAS - CMD生成的活动。

Conclusion: 将教学原则嵌入大语言模型系统可为创建高质量教育内容提供可扩展途径。

Abstract: K-12 educators are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create
instructional materials. These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent
content, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is
twofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the
most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of
pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second,
although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers
lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical
nuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the
user's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established
Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS)
to act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for
generating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent
baseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work
sequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities
through conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by
20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the
Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small,
often statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the
qualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture.
Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD,
describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and
classroom-ready. Our findings show that embedding pedagogical principles into
LLM systems offers a scalable path for creating high-quality educational
content.

Motivation: 灾难常超出既定风险模型，存在应对盲区，需要重视态势感知能力以增强灾难恢复力。

Method: 提出技术 - 流程 - 人员路线图，采用系统 - 系统方法，利用实时灾害临近预报、互操作工作流和授权团队将原始数据转化为可操作的见解。

Result: 通过系统 - 系统方法使多机构共享及时信息且不牺牲各自运营模式，结构化的意义建构程序和认知负荷保障措施有助于人类在数据丰富时有效决策。

Conclusion: 应将SA提升为灾难恢复力的核心目标，并给出开发SA指标、设计可信人机协作、加强包容性数据治理等进一步研究建议。

Abstract: Disasters frequently exceed established hazard models, revealing blind spots
where unforeseen impacts and vulnerabilities hamper effective response. This
perspective paper contends that situational awareness (SA)-the ability to
perceive, interpret, and project dynamic crisis conditions-is an often
overlooked yet vital capability for disaster resilience. While risk mitigation
measures can reduce known threats, not all hazards can be neutralized; truly
adaptive resilience hinges on whether organizations rapidly detect emerging
failures, reconcile diverse data sources, and direct interventions where they
matter most. We present a technology-process-people roadmap, demonstrating how
real-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, and empowered teams
collectively transform raw data into actionable insight. A system-of-systems
approach enables federated data ownership and modular analytics, so multiple
agencies can share timely updates without sacrificing their distinct
operational models. Equally crucial, structured sense-making routines and
cognitive load safeguards help humans remain effective decision-makers amid
data abundance. By framing SA as a socio-technical linchpin rather than a
peripheral add-on, this paper spotlights the urgency of elevating SA to a core
disaster resilience objective. We conclude with recommendations for further
research-developing SA metrics, designing trustworthy human-AI collaboration,
and strengthening inclusive data governance-to ensure that communities are
equipped to cope with both expected and unexpected crises.

Result: 开发者关注技术问题，研究者强调社会影响，二者都忽视欺诈和操纵风险。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰、结构化的风险报告，助力开发者在设计早期考虑人机交互和系统性风险。

Abstract: We analyzed nearly 460,000 AI model cards from Hugging Face to examine how
developers report risks. From these, we extracted around 3,000 unique risk
mentions and built the \emph{AI Model Risk Catalog}. We compared these with
risks identified by researchers in the MIT Risk Repository and with real-world
incidents from the AI Incident Database. Developers focused on technical issues
like bias and safety, while researchers emphasized broader social impacts. Both
groups paid little attention to fraud and manipulation, which are common harms
arising from how people interact with AI. Our findings show the need for
clearer, structured risk reporting that helps developers think about
human-interaction and systemic risks early in the design process. The catalog

Motivation: 人工智能用于招聘引发偏见、公平和信任问题，且缺乏跨文化AI招聘评估潜在偏见的系统研究。

Method: 使用英国和印度求职者面试记录数据集，分析跨文化大语言模型评分差异，在印度数据集进行身份替换测试。

Result: 印度记录得分低于英国，差异与语言特征有关；名字单独替换无显著影响。

Conclusion: LLM驱动评估要考虑语言和社会维度，AI辅助招聘需文化敏感设计和问责。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in hiring, with large
language models (LLMs) having the potential to influence or even make hiring
decisions. However, this raises pressing concerns about bias, fairness, and
trust, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Despite their growing
role, few studies have systematically examined the potential biases in
AI-driven hiring evaluation across cultures. In this study, we conduct a
systematic analysis of how LLMs assess job interviews across cultural and
identity dimensions. Using two datasets of interview transcripts, 100 from UK
and 100 from Indian job seekers, we first examine cross-cultural differences in
LLM-generated scores for hirability and related traits. Indian transcripts
receive consistently lower scores than UK transcripts, even when they were
anonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features such as sentence
complexity and lexical diversity. We then perform controlled identity
substitutions (varying names by gender, caste, and region) within the Indian
dataset to test for name-based bias. These substitutions do not yield
statistically significant effects, indicating that names alone, when isolated
from other contextual signals, may not influence LLM evaluations. Our findings
underscore the importance of evaluating both linguistic and social dimensions
in LLM-driven evaluations and highlight the need for culturally sensitive
design and accountability in AI-assisted hiring.

Conclusion: 探讨了生成式人工智能的近远期未来，强调其在学术和教育中的作用及社会责任。

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning,
and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and
education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI)
through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer
architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative
systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings,
and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are
examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are
considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the
limitations and risks they entail.
  The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research
process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data
collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular
attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider
academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of
GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment,
and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.
  Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges
posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and
accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and
emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section
considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of
sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI
within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes
to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal
responsibilities.

Motivation: 情景式教学规划耗时多，复杂技术加剧此问题，且多元文化融合在紧张课程中难以开展。

Method: 与4位教师共同设计活动框架，在27名学生中开展为期1周的研究。

Result: 验证系统有效性，发现儿童对融合政策有积极感受，情景活动提升学生乐趣，讲故事时效果更显著。

Conclusion: 讨论了在长期课堂活动中使用LLMs和社交机器人的若干影响。

Abstract: Creating and improvising scenarios for content approaching is an enriching
technique in education. However, it comes with a significant increase in the
time spent on its planning, which intensifies when using complex technologies,
such as social robots. Furthermore, addressing multicultural integration is
commonly embedded in regular activities due to the already tight curriculum.
Addressing these issues with a single solution, we implemented an intuitive
interface that allows teachers to create scenario-based activities from their
regular curriculum using LLMs and social robots. We co-designed different
frameworks of activities with 4 teachers and deployed it in a study with 27
students for 1 week. Beyond validating the system's efficacy, our findings
highlight the positive impact of integration policies perceived by the children
and demonstrate the importance of scenario-based activities in students'
enjoyment, observed to be significantly higher when applying storytelling.
Additionally, several implications of using LLMs and social robots in long-term
classroom activities are discussed.

Motivation: AI技术快速迭代中存在企业盲目投资、忽视系统价值评估的非理性发展问题，需量化AI产品价值。

Method: 整合信息理论的熵减原理、经济学的有限理性框架和心理学的非理性决策理论，构建多维评估模型，用非线性公式捕捉因素耦合。

Result: 通过10个商业案例验证模型能有效区分成功和失败产品，揭示了价值生成逻辑。

Conclusion: 模型可为企业避免盲目投资、促进AI行业理性发展提供工具，未来可研究自适应权重、动态机制等。

Abstract: In recent years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) technology
have triggered global industrial transformations, with applications permeating
various fields such as finance, healthcare, education, and manufacturing.
However, this rapid iteration is accompanied by irrational development, where
enterprises blindly invest due to technology hype, often overlooking systematic
value assessments. This paper develops a multi-dimensional evaluation model
that integrates information theory's entropy reduction principle, economics'
bounded rationality framework, and psychology's irrational decision theories to
quantify AI product value. Key factors include positive dimensions (e.g.,
uncertainty elimination, efficiency gains, cost savings, decision quality
improvement) and negative risks (e.g., error probability, impact, and
correction costs). A non-linear formula captures factor couplings, and
validation through 10 commercial cases demonstrates the model's effectiveness
in distinguishing successful and failed products, supporting hypotheses on
synergistic positive effects, non-linear negative impacts, and interactive
regulations. Results reveal value generation logic, offering enterprises tools
to avoid blind investments and promote rational AI industry development. Future
directions include adaptive weights, dynamic mechanisms, and extensions to
emerging AI technologies like generative models.

TL;DR: 本文针对知识追踪（KT）模型中的标签泄露问题提出解决方案，引入MASK标签和最近邻编码，将其融入现有KT模型可提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多KT模型依赖知识概念（KCs），部分模型在每个问题包含多个KCs的数据集上易出现标签泄露问题。

Method: 在易发生泄露的输入嵌入构建过程中，引入专用的MASK标签替换真实标签；引入最近邻编码（Recency Encoding）对当前项目与其最近一次出现的距离进行编码。

Result: 最近邻编码在多个KT基准测试中表现优于传统位置编码；将提出的嵌入方法融入DKT、DKT+、AKT和SAKT等KT模型，在多个基准测试中持续提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效防止标签泄露，提高KT模型预测准确性，且高效、适用范围广。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict a student's future performance based
on their sequence of interactions with learning content. Many KT models rely on
knowledge concepts (KCs), which represent the skills required for each item.
However, some of these models are vulnerable to label leakage, in which input
data inadvertently reveal the correct answer, particularly in datasets with
multiple KCs per question.
  We propose a straightforward yet effective solution to prevent label leakage
by masking ground-truth labels during input embedding construction in cases
susceptible to leakage. To accomplish this, we introduce a dedicated MASK
label, inspired by masked language modeling (e.g., BERT), to replace
ground-truth labels. In addition, we introduce Recency Encoding, which encodes
the step-wise distance between the current item and its most recent previous
occurrence. This distance is important for modeling learning dynamics such as
forgetting, which is a fundamental aspect of human learning, yet it is often
overlooked in existing models. Recency Encoding demonstrates improved
performance over traditional positional encodings on multiple KT benchmarks.
  We show that incorporating our embeddings into KT models like DKT, DKT+, AKT,
and SAKT consistently improves prediction accuracy across multiple benchmarks.
The approach is both efficient and widely applicable.

Method: 基于中国法院真实程序结构构建SimCourt框架，复制中国审判5个核心阶段，纳入5个法庭角色，设计具备记忆、规划和反思能力的法律智能体。

Result: 实验表明框架能生成模拟审判，更好指导系统预测案件的监禁、缓刑和罚款情况，人类专家标注显示模拟框架下智能体的回应在很多场景中优于真实审判的法官和律师。

Conclusion: 展示了基于大语言模型的法庭模拟的潜力。

Abstract: Mock trial has long served as an important platform for legal professional
training and education. It not only helps students learn about realistic trial
procedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment
prediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public
because they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately,
the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for
creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising,
existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the
systematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more
important for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To
this end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based
on the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework
replicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom
roles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate
trial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents
equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities. Experiment on legal
judgment prediction show that our framework can generate simulated trials that
better guide the system to predict the imprisonment, probation, and fine of
each case. Further annotations by human experts show that agents' responses
under our simulation framework even outperformed judges and lawyers from the
real trials in many scenarios. These further demonstrate the potential of
LLM-based court simulation.

Motivation: 探究文本到图像生成器（T2Is）在生成图像时是否会延续社会刻板印象，尤其是在种族或肤色方面。

Method: 使用93种受污名化身份的综合集合，对Stable Diffusion三个版本（v1.5、v2.1和XL）生成的图像进行分析。

Result: SD XL生成的肤色更暗、更缺乏红色，肤色变异性更小，强化了刻板印象。

Conclusion: 这些发现对T2Is中偏见放大的动态有影响，增加了代表性伤害和生成多样化污名化身份图像的挑战。

Abstract: Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate
social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a
comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions
of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized
identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL
produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which
indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and
perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized
identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones
when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face
datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to
human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount
of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts
most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized
identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and
ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities,
reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and
socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest
and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other
models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the
dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and
challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized
identities.

Result: 在Java和Python入门课程的两个独立数据集上评估，PTM模型在预测编程困难学生方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结合教师的结构化见解可用于早期识别需要编程学习帮助的学生。

Abstract: Early detection of struggling student programmers is crucial for providing
them with personalized support. While multiple AI-based approaches have been
proposed for this problem, they do not explicitly reason about students'
programming skills in the model. This study addresses this gap by developing in
collaboration with educators a taxonomy of proficiencies that categorizes how
students solve coding tasks and is embedded in the detection model. Our model,
termed the Proficiency Taxonomy Model (PTM), simultaneously learns the
student's coding skills based on their coding history and predicts whether they
will struggle on a new task. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the
PTM model on two separate datasets from introductory Java and Python courses
for beginner programmers. Experimental results demonstrate that PTM outperforms
state-of-the-art models in predicting struggling students. The paper showcases
the potential of combining structured insights from teachers for early
identification of those needing assistance in learning to code.

Abstract: Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands
systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily
lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework
that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing,
open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India,
the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based
measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy
diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived
Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new
metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing
engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based
on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration.
Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate
actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This
framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active
platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing
ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a
replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a
co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice.

Abstract: Intersectionality has profoundly influenced research and political action by
revealing how interconnected systems of privilege and oppression influence
lived experiences, yet its integration into algorithmic fairness research
remains limited. Existing approaches often rely on single-axis or formal
subgroup frameworks that risk oversimplifying social realities and neglecting
structural inequalities. We propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic
Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness
with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Building on this foundation,
we introduce ten desiderata within the ROOF methodology to guide the design,
assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems in ways that address systemic
inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities.
Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata encourage
reflection on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the
inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and enhancing algorithmic systems'
potential. Our approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from
social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be
necessary. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, we
provide actionable guidance for more equitable, inclusive, and

### [340] [FasterVoiceGrad: Faster One-step Diffusion-Based Voice Conversion with Adversarial Diffusion Conversion Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17868)
*Takuhiro Kaneko,Hirokazu Kameoka,Kou Tanaka,Yuto Kondo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出FasterVoiceGrad解决现有扩散式语音转换模型转换慢的问题，实验表明其速度更快且性能有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散式语音转换模型转换过程慢，FastVoiceGrad仍需计算密集型内容编码器拖慢转换速度。

Method: 使用对抗扩散转换蒸馏（ADCD）同时蒸馏扩散模型和内容编码器得到FasterVoiceGrad，在转换过程中进行蒸馏并利用对抗和分数蒸馏训练。

Result: 在单样本语音转换实验中，FasterVoiceGrad与FastVoiceGrad相比有竞争力，在GPU和CPU上速度分别快6.6 - 6.9倍和1.8倍。

Conclusion: FasterVoiceGrad能有效提升语音转换速度并保持竞争力。

Abstract: A diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) model (e.g., VoiceGrad) can achieve
high speech quality and speaker similarity; however, its conversion process is
slow owing to iterative sampling. FastVoiceGrad overcomes this limitation by
distilling VoiceGrad into a one-step diffusion model. However, it still
requires a computationally intensive content encoder to disentangle the
speaker's identity and content, which slows conversion. Therefore, we propose
FasterVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC model obtained by
simultaneously distilling a diffusion model and content encoder using
adversarial diffusion conversion distillation (ADCD), where distillation is
performed in the conversion process while leveraging adversarial and score
distillation training. Experimental evaluations of one-shot VC demonstrated
that FasterVoiceGrad achieves competitive VC performance compared to
FastVoiceGrad, with 6.6-6.9 and 1.8 times faster speed on a GPU and CPU,
respectively.

TL;DR: 提出用于对抗训练的VPFD，在扩散式VC蒸馏实验中，能在降低训练时间和内存消耗的同时达到与波形鉴别器相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTS和VC中用声码器将特征转换为波形并进行时域对抗训练有合理性，但上采样波形会带来显著时间和内存开销，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出vocoder - projected feature discriminator (VPFD)，使用声码器特征进行对抗训练。

Result: 在扩散式VC蒸馏实验中，预训练且冻结的声码器特征提取器配合单步上采样，能在将训练时间和内存消耗分别降低9.6倍和11.4倍的同时，达到与波形鉴别器相当的VC性能。

Conclusion: VPFD能有效解决上采样波形带来的时间和内存开销问题，在降低成本的同时保证性能。

Abstract: In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as
mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing
to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal
is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these
features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is
reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time
and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected
feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial
training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a
pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step
is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of
waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption
by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.

Abstract: The WildSpoof Challenge aims to advance the use of in-the-wild data in two
intertwined speech processing tasks. It consists of two parallel tracks: (1)
Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for generating spoofed speech, and (2)
Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV) for detecting spoofed
speech. While the organizers coordinate both tracks and define the data
protocols, participants treat them as separate and independent tasks. The
primary objectives of the challenge are: (i) to promote the use of in-the-wild
data for both TTS and SASV, moving beyond conventional clean and controlled
datasets and considering real-world scenarios; and (ii) to encourage
interdisciplinary collaboration between the spoofing generation (TTS) and
spoofing detection (SASV) communities, thereby fostering the development of
more integrated, robust, and realistic systems.

Conclusion: 多指标偏好对齐策略有效，对齐后的模型可在数据稀缺场景为传统判别模型提供高质量伪标签。

Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration
tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual
preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has
proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation,
its application to generative speech restoration remains largely
under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying
preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust
preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To
address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment
strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference
pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite
of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency,
and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference
signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we
observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse
generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models
(MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both
objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority
of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward
hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as
powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as
a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce
scenarios like singing voice restoration. Demo

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音分词器存在依赖多层结构或高帧率、依赖预训练模型、需复杂两阶段训练等局限，需新方法克服。

Method: 采用扩散自编码器进行端到端量化和重建优化，在扩散解码器中集成文本引导。

Result: 实现6.25 Hz极低帧率和0.0875 kbps比特率，在WER、SIM、UTMOS等指标表现好，单阶段端到端训练，无需预训练模型，验证在零样本TTS兼容性。

Conclusion: TaDiCodec对语音语言建模有效高效，重建-生成差距小，将开源代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language
models, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1)
dependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame
rates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation,
and 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we
introduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a
novel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs
end-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion
autoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to
enhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec
achieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of
0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining
superior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as
Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS).
Notably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and
obviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the
compatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech
with both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating
its effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a
significantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code
and model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at
https:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at
https:/github.com/HeCheng0625/Diffusion-Speech-Tokenizer.

Motivation: BMS抗噪强但缺少高频信息，需互补模态，传统多模态方法简单合并特征，因此提出新多模态框架以实现降噪和高频重建。

Result: 在TAPS数据集和DNS - 2023噪声片段上评估，表明方法在多种嘈杂环境中优于单模态方案。

Conclusion: 所提多模态框架能有效实现降噪和高频重建，在多种嘈杂环境表现良好。

Abstract: Body\-conduction microphone signals (BMS) bypass airborne sound, providing
strong noise resistance. However, a complementary modality is required to
compensate for the inherent loss of high\-frequency information. In this study,
we propose a novel multi\-modal framework that combines BMS and acoustic
microphone signals (AMS) to achieve both noise suppression and high\-frequency
reconstruction. Unlike conventional multi\-modal approaches that simply merge
features, our method employs two specialized networks\: a mapping-based model
to enhance BMS and a masking-based model to denoise AMS. These networks are
integrated through a dynamic fusion mechanism that adapts to local noise
conditions, ensuring the optimal use of each modality's strengths. We performed
evaluations on the TAPS dataset, augmented with DNS\-2023 noise clips, using
objective speech quality metrics. The results clearly demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single\-modal solutions in a wide range of noisy
environments.

Abstract: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous
suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or
acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such
as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an
individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st
SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch
multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness
detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on
time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both
time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as
semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to
adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it
applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling
the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational
efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original
baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system
exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a
78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: 技术改进为研究狄拉克自旋液体态及其相变提供途径，降低计算负担。

Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to
solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to
fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the
description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a
good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume
scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the
imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more
efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such
acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including
(i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii)
customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph
implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac
spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to
$N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel
properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic
convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and
the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The
scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation,
which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac
spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to
study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking
phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly
advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from
large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has
outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which
complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific
progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures
genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce
EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and
standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions
are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets
from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and
evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark
prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive
baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we
perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights
into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive
experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction,
multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to
enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a
unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench
seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of
more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at

Abstract: Geological Carbon Sequestration (GCS) has emerged as a promising strategy for
mitigating global warming, yet its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately
characterizing subsurface flow dynamics. The inherent geological uncertainty,
stemming from limited observations and reservoir heterogeneity, poses
significant challenges to predictive modeling. Existing methods for inverse
modeling and uncertainty quantification are computationally intensive and lack
generalizability, restricting their practical utility. Here, we introduce a
Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD-geo) model, a generative
framework for efficient and uncertainty-aware forward and inverse modeling of
GCS processes. CoNFiLD-geo synergistically combines conditional neural field
encoding with Bayesian conditional latent-space diffusion models, enabling
zero-shot conditional generation of geomodels and reservoir responses across
complex geometries and grid structures. The model is pretrained unconditionally
in a self-supervised manner, followed by a Bayesian posterior sampling process,
allowing for data assimilation for unseen/unobserved states without
task-specific retraining. Comprehensive validation across synthetic and
real-world GCS scenarios demonstrates CoNFiLD-geo's superior efficiency,
generalization, scalability, and robustness. By enabling effective data
assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and reliable forward modeling,
CoNFiLD-geo significantly advances intelligent decision-making in geo-energy
systems, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, net-zero carbon
future.

Conclusion: MeshSplat框架有效解决了极稀疏视图下的表面重建问题。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

Abstract: Spatial proteomics maps protein distributions in tissues, providing
transformative insights for life sciences. However, current sequencing-based
technologies suffer from low spatial resolution, and substantial inter-tissue
variability in protein expression further compromises the performance of
existing molecular data prediction methods. In this work, we introduce the
novel task of spatial super-resolution for sequencing-based spatial proteomics
(seq-SP) and, to the best of our knowledge, propose the first deep learning
model for this task--Neural Proteomics Fields (NPF). NPF formulates seq-SP as a
protein reconstruction problem in continuous space by training a dedicated
network for each tissue. The model comprises a Spatial Modeling Module, which
learns tissue-specific protein spatial distributions, and a Morphology Modeling
Module, which extracts tissue-specific morphological features. Furthermore, to
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we establish an open-source benchmark dataset,
Pseudo-Visium SP, for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF
achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer learnable parameters,
underscoring its potential for advancing spatial proteomics research. Our code

Motivation: 在光学计算中建立关键收敛点，实现交错的离散 - 连续工作流。

Method: 将名义上线性光子散射器的结构非线性转化为计算资源，通过添加一个通过相同空间光调制器的中继通道，利用折叠4f中继等技术。

Result: 实现了无非线性介质的原生每团k - 局部耦合以及KAN层所需的多个独立单变量非线性，可使用两帧物理梯度进行训练。

Conclusion: 在多种硬件上实现该方案只需增加一个额外透镜和折叠（或片上4f环路），为高阶光学Ising优化和可训练的全光KAN处理提供了低开销、大规模并行的途径。

Abstract: We unify k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN function learning on a
single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical
computing that enables interleaved discrete-continuous workflows. We introduce
a single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one
stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical
Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert
structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a
per-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same
spatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane
onto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a
disjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains
linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes
a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude.
This yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and,
in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN
layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame
(forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial
photonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft
analog optical computers. In all cases the hardware change is one extra lens
and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively
parallel route to high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable,
all-optical KAN processing.

Motivation: 传统监督式机器学习方法用于历史文献NER需大量标注数据，但历史文本标注数据集稀缺，且历史语言存在变异性和噪声，因此探索用LLMs解决此问题。

Method: 在HIPE - 2022数据集上，运用零样本和少样本提示策略，将LLMs应用于历史文献的NER任务。

Result: LLMs在该设置下的NER任务能取得不错表现，虽不及基于特定领域标注训练的全监督模型，但结果有前景。

Conclusion: LLMs为低资源或历史重要语料的信息提取提供了可行且高效的替代方案，传统监督方法在此不可行。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named
Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper
names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other
specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from
unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information
retrieval from unstructured text.
  Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches,
which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical
texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or
nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling.
In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as
inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the
development of reliable NER systems for these sources.
  In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in
historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which
require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on
the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities)
dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks
in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models
trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising.
These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for
information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora,
where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.

Conclusion: 机器学习是传统纠缠检测方法的有力补充，指出未来研究方向如混合量子 - 经典实现和改进数据生成协议。

Abstract: This work presents a machine learning approach based on support vector
machines (SVMs) for quantum entanglement detection. Particularly, we focus in
bipartite systems of dimensions 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, where the positive partial
transpose criterion (PPT) provides only partial characterization. Using SVMs
with quantum-inspired kernels we develop a classification scheme that
distinguishes between separable states, PPT-detectable entangled states, and
entangled states that evade PPT detection. Our method achieves increasing
accuracy with system dimension, reaching 80%, 90%, and nearly 100% for 3x3,
4x4, and 5x5 systems, respectively. Our results show that principal component
analysis significantly enhances performance for small training sets. The study
reveals important practical considerations regarding purity biases in the
generation of data for this problem and examines the challenges of implementing
these techniques on near-term quantum hardware. Our results establish machine
learning as a powerful complement to traditional entanglement detection
methods, particularly for higher-dimensional systems where conventional
approaches become inadequate. The findings highlight key directions for future
research, including hybrid quantum-classical implementations and improved data
generation protocols to overcome current limitations.

Conclusion: 复用丢弃的量子比特信息对未来混合量子 - 经典模型是有前景的方法，可能扩展到图像分类以外的任务。

Abstract: This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image
classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the
discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical
classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit
states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain
entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is
lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the
conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a
hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully
connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately
process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are
ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a
classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to
adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on
MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing
discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid
quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.

Motivation: 评估GPT - OSS - 20B在单GPU上对比密集基线模型的性能，聚焦部署优势。

Method: 在单GPU（H100, bf16）上，从多个维度评估，用nvidia - smi采样测量。

Result: 在2048/64设置下，GPT - OSS - 20B解码吞吐量、每焦耳生成token数更高，峰值VRAM和每1000生成token能耗更低，TTFT因MoE路由开销较高；按活跃参数归一化后APE更强。

Conclusion: GPT - OSS - 20B有显著部署优势，释放代码和结果便于复现和扩展。

Abstract: We present a single-GPU (H100, bf16) evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B
(Mixture-of-Experts; 20.9B total, approx. 3.61B active) against dense baselines
Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B across multiple dimensions. We measure true
time-to-first-token (TTFT), full-decode throughput (TPOT), end-to-end latency
percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values (PKV) held, and energy via a
consistent nvidia-smi-based sampler. At a 2048-token context with 64-token
decode, GPT-OSS-20B delivers higher decode throughput and tokens per Joule than
dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B, while substantially reducing peak VRAM
and energy per 1000 generated tokens; its TTFT is higher due to MoE routing
overhead. With only 17.3% of parameters active (3.61B of 20.9B), GPT-OSS-20B
provides about 31.8% higher decode throughput and 25.8% lower energy per 1000
generated tokens than Qwen3-32B at 2048/64, while using 31.7% less peak VRAM.
Normalized by active parameters, GPT-OSS-20B shows markedly stronger
per-active-parameter efficiency (APE), underscoring MoE's deployment
advantages. We do not evaluate accuracy; this is a deployment-focused study. We
release code and consolidated results to enable replication and extension.

Conclusion: 该方法为能量关键的边缘AI提供了实用解决方案，突破了计算强度和功耗限制。

Abstract: Learned activation functions in models like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)
outperform fixed-activation architectures in terms of accuracy and
interpretability; however, their computational complexity poses critical
challenges for energy-constrained edge AI deployments. Conventional CPUs/GPUs
incur prohibitive latency and power costs when evaluating higher order
activations, limiting deployability under ultra-tight energy budgets. We
address this via a reconfigurable lookup architecture with edge FPGAs. By
coupling fine-grained quantization with adaptive lookup tables, our design
minimizes energy-intensive arithmetic operations while preserving activation
fidelity. FPGA reconfigurability enables dynamic hardware specialization for
learned functions, a key advantage for edge systems that require
post-deployment adaptability. Evaluations using KANs - where unique activation
functions play a critical role - demonstrate that our FPGA-based design
achieves superior computational speed and over $10^4$ times higher energy
efficiency compared to edge CPUs and GPUs, while maintaining matching accuracy
and minimal footprint overhead. This breakthrough positions our approach as a
practical enabler for energy-critical edge AI, where computational intensity
and power constraints traditionally preclude the use of adaptive activation
networks.

Result: 指出并非所有人类模型和子理论都适用于人工主体。

Conclusion: 鉴于机器能力提升和人类易受影响，专家需为自身利益保持警惕。

Abstract: Social identity theory (SIT) and social categorization theory (SCT) are two
facets of the social identity approach (SIA) to understanding social phenomena.
SIT and SCT are models that describe and explain how people interact with one
another socially, connecting the individual to the group through an
understanding of underlying psychological mechanisms and intergroup behaviour.
SIT, originally developed in the 1970s, and SCT, a later, more general
offshoot, have been broadly applied to a range of social phenomena among
people. The rise of increasingly social machines embedded in daily life has
spurned efforts on understanding whether and how artificial agents can and do
participate in SIA activities. As agents like social robots and chatbots
powered by sophisticated large language models (LLMs) advance, understanding
the real and potential roles of these technologies as social entities is
crucial. Here, I provide a primer on SIA and extrapolate, through case studies
and imagined examples, how SIT and SCT can apply to artificial social agents. I
emphasize that not all human models and sub-theories will apply. I further
argue that, given the emerging competence of these machines and our tendency to
be taken in by them, we experts may need to don the hat of the uncanny killjoy,
for our own good.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a novel optimistic gradient-type algorithmic framework, combining
both Nesterov's acceleration and variance-reduction techniques, to solve a
class of generalized equations involving possibly nonmonotone operators in
data-driven applications. Our framework covers a wide class of stochastic
variance-reduced schemes, including mini-batching, and control variate unbiased
and biased estimators. We establish that our method achieves
$\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ convergence rates in expectation on the squared norm of
residual under the Lipschitz continuity and a ``co-hypomonotonicity-type''
assumptions, improving upon non-accelerated counterparts by a factor of $1/k$.
We also prove faster $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates, both in expectation and
almost surely. In addition, we show that the sequence of iterates of our method
almost surely converges to a solution of the underlying problem. We demonstrate
the applicability of our method using general error bound criteria, covering
mini-batch stochastic estimators as well as three well-known control variate
estimators: loopless SVRG, SAGA, and loopless SARAH, for which the last three
variants attain significantly better oracle complexity compared to existing
methods. We validate our framework and theoretical results through two
numerical examples. The preliminary results illustrate promising performance of
our accelerated method over its non-accelerated counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to
understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized.
Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have
shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a
parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield
dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the
difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger
adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship
between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its
corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a
system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence
future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for
evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in
$O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement
over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or
unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that
parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the
optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable
systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence
length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing
practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently
parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for
parallelizable models.

Abstract: One of the essential issues in decision problems and preference modeling is
the number of comparisons and their pattern to ask from the decision maker. We
focus on the optimal patterns of pairwise comparisons and the sequence
including the most (close to) optimal cases based on the results of a color
selection experiment. In the test, six colors (red, green, blue, magenta,
turquoise, yellow) were evaluated with pairwise comparisons as well as in a
direct manner, on color-calibrated tablets in ISO standardized sensory test
booths of a sensory laboratory. All the possible patterns of comparisons
resulting in a connected representing graph were evaluated against the complete
data based on 301 individual's pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) using the
logarithmic least squares weight calculation technique. It is shown that the
empirical results, i.e., the empirical distributions of the elements of PCMs,
are quite similar to the former simulated outcomes from the literature. The
obtained empirically optimal patterns of comparisons were the best or the
second best in the former simulations as well, while the sequence of
comparisons that contains the most (close to) optimal patterns is exactly the
same. In order to enhance the applicability of the results, besides the

Motivation: 传统L²失配函数存在非凸性导致周期跳跃问题，Wasserstein距离需预处理且会修改波场信息，需更好的度量方法。

Method: 提出HV度量，推导其Fréchet导数和Hessian矩阵的闭式表达式，进行谱分析。

Result: 通过合成实验，HV度量目标函数比L²和Wasserstein失配函数收敛更快，对初始模型容忍度更高。

Conclusion: HV度量是大规模波形反演中一种稳健、保几何的替代方法。

Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing
high-resolution material parameters from seismic or ultrasound data. The
conventional least-squares (\(L^{2}\)) misfit suffers from pronounced
non-convexity that leads to \emph{cycle skipping}. Optimal-transport misfits,
such as the Wasserstein distance, alleviate this issue; however, their use
requires artificially converting the wavefields into probability measures, a
preprocessing step that can modify critical amplitude and phase information of
time-dependent wave data. We propose the \emph{HV metric}, a transport-based
distance that acts naturally on signed signals, as an alternative metric for
the \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein objectives in time-domain FWI. After reviewing
the metric's definition and its relationship to optimal transport, we derive
closed-form expressions for the Fr\'echet derivative and Hessian of the map \(f
\mapsto d_{\text{HV}}^2(f,g)\), enabling efficient adjoint-state
implementations. A spectral analysis of the Hessian shows that, by tuning the
hyperparameters \((\kappa,\lambda,\epsilon)\), the HV misfit seamlessly
interpolates between \(L^{2}\), \(H^{-1}\), and \(H^{-2}\) norms, offering a
tunable trade-off between the local point-wise matching and the global
transport-based matching. Synthetic experiments on the Marmousi and BP
benchmark models demonstrate that the HV metric-based objective function yields
faster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to
both \(L^{2}\) and Wasserstein misfits. These results demonstrate the HV metric
as a robust, geometry-preserving alternative for large-scale waveform
inversion.

Conclusion: 基于研究结果可构建能在金融市场盈利且能明确控制下行风险的交易策略。

Abstract: In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for
financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between
model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial
derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&P
500 between 2018 and 2022.
  Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff
and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which
degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that
the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than
industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the
same time.
  This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the
hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as
we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and
additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its
downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.

Motivation: 传统分子对接虚拟筛选预测精度有限，Boltz - 2 计算效率低难以用于大规模筛选，需开发兼顾精度与效率的方法。

Method: 省略Boltz - 2架构中限速的结构预测步骤，直接从AutoDock Vina对接构象预测亲和力；采用减少循环迭代和批量处理；研究多构象选择策略和两阶段筛选。

Result: Boltzina精度略低于Boltz - 2，但筛选性能显著高于AutoDock Vina和GNINA，速度提高达11.8倍。

Conclusion: 本研究首次将Boltz - 2高精度预测用于实际规模筛选，提供了计算生物学中兼顾精度与效率的流程，Boltzina代码开源。

Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional
molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations
in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely
high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20
seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale
screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study
proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy
while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both
accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from
Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina
docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show
that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher
screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,
Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling
iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose
selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,
presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to
application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply
Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a
pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.

Abstract: Comprehending the long-timescale dynamics of protein-ligand complexes is very
important for drug discovery and structural biology, but it continues to be
computationally challenging for large biomolecular systems. We introduce
HemePLM-Diffuse, an innovative generative transformer model that is designed
for accurate simulation of protein-ligand trajectories, inpaints the missing
ligand fragments, and sample transition paths in systems with more than 10,000
atoms. HemePLM-Diffuse has features of SE(3)-Invariant tokenization approach
for proteins and ligands, that utilizes time-aware cross-attentional diffusion
to effectively capture atomic motion. We also demonstrate its capabilities
using the 3CQV HEME system, showing enhanced accuracy and scalability compared
to leading models such as TorchMD-Net, MDGEN, and Uni-Mol.

Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have
enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties.
However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to
generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and
symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by
proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which
is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition.
We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting
per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip,
we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that
solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target
flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate
novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at
https://github.com/graeter-group/flips .

Conclusion: 明确了Grundy支配问题变体的复杂度，扩展了零强迫问题树宽结果，为相关问题提供了FPT算法。

Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in
graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence,
every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any
earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating
sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the
closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other
versions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are
$\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by the solution size. On the other
hand, we consider the family of Zero forcing problems which form the
parameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one
looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain
color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et
al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as
$\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the
treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other
three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems.
Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for
$\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that
are not in the dominating sequence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑编程中需要一种系统的方法来构建可证明正确且半完备的逻辑程序，以处理正确性和完备性问题。

Method: 在Kunen的三值完备语义和有根语义下，采用声明式方法，从操作语义细节中抽象出来。

Result: 提出了一种简单的构建可证明正确且半完备逻辑程序的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于实际的日常编程。

Abstract: Partial correctness of imperative or functional programming divides in logic
programming into two notions. Correctness means that all answers of the program
are compatible with the specification. Completeness means that the program
produces all the answers required by the specifications. We also consider
semi-completeness -- completeness for those queries for which the program does
not diverge. This paper presents an approach to systematically construct
provably correct and semi-complete logic programs, for a given specification.
Normal programs are considered, under Kunen's 3-valued completion semantics (of
negation as finite failure) and the well-founded semantics (of negation as
possibly infinite failure). The approach is declarative, it abstracts from
details of operational semantics, like e.g.\ the form of the selected literals
(``procedure calls'') during the computation. The proposed method is simple,
and can be used (maybe informally) in actual everyday programming.

Motivation: 基于实际应用场景，研究 SSM 可满足性问题 ssmSAT 的复杂度，以了解其计算能力和验证的可能性。

Method: 研究一般情况下 ssmSAT 的可判定性，确定有界上下文长度和固定宽度算术量化这两种限制条件，分别分析不同条件下的复杂度。

Result: 一般情况下 ssmSAT 不可判定；有界上下文长度时，输入长度一元表示 ssmSAT 为 NP 完全，二进制表示为 NEXPTIME（PSPACE 难）；固定宽度算术量化时，根据位宽编码 ssmSAT 为 PSPACE 完全或 EXPSPACE；还给出了时间不变 SSM 的复杂度界限。

Conclusion: 为 SSM 形式推理建立了首个复杂度图景，凸显了 SSM 语言模型验证的基本限制和机会。

Abstract: We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem ssmSAT for State
Space Models (SSM), which asks whether an input sequence can lead the model to
an accepting configuration. We find that ssmSAT is undecidable in general,
reflecting the computational power of SSM. Motivated by practical settings, we
identify two natural restrictions under which ssmSAT becomes decidable and
establish corresponding complexity bounds. First, for SSM with bounded context
length, ssmSAT is NP-complete when the input length is given in unary and in
NEXPTIME (and PSPACE-hard) when the input length is given in binary. Second,
for quantised SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic, ssmSAT is
PSPACE-complete resp. in EXPSPACE depending on the bit-width encoding. While
these results hold for diagonal gated SSM we also establish complexity bounds
for time-invariant SSM. Our results establish a first complexity landscape for
formal reasoning in SSM and highlight fundamental limits and opportunities for
the verification of SSM-based language models.

Abstract: Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations
but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational
clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and
efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the
universe.

Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing
interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the
challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to
study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a
design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational
budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for
studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to
exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze
how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design
space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a
better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization
algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.
This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently
find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies
that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the
algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the
morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms
regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,
as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work
provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary
brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature
and provide valuable insights for future work.

Conclusion: 此研究是概念验证，有望推动智能不同模型的进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an
essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it
difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In
contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent
behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated
aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent
behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of
constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent
behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.
Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined
to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit
zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an
MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer
to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior
as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image
classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that
this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into
different models of intelligence.

Motivation: 人类检查受限工业基础设施危险且低效，无人机是有前景的替代方案，但在无GPS环境需强大控制策略，故对比两种DRL算法。

Method: 在Genesis模拟环境的程序生成管道环境中训练，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过路点并对碰撞惩罚。

Result: PPO学习到稳定策略，无碰撞完成所有评估情节，轨迹平滑；SAC收敛到次优行为，仅通过初始段就失败。

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，策略内方法的训练稳定性可能超过策略外算法的名义样本效率，程序生成的高保真模拟是开发和基准测试导航策略的有效试验台。

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation
accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world
sensory constraints. The video visualization results can be found on the

Conclusion: 提出的M - diffusion planner有效解决现有规划器问题，有良好性能和轨迹多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: HDSim框架有效提升了模拟平台交通场景的逼真度，有助于更好地评估自动驾驶系统可靠性。

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon
manipulation tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks
require both physical dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills
while robustly handling environment variations. While imitation learning offers
a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive.
In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that
automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful
skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic
demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement learning.
These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill Routing
Transformer (SRT) policy effectively chaining the learned skills together to
execute complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations on

Result: 模拟和真实世界实验表明，GWM能精确预测未来场景，训练出的策略大幅超越现有技术水平。

Conclusion: GWM具有精确预测和训练高性能策略的能力，展现了3D世界模型的初始数据扩展潜力。

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Motivation: 现实场景中ASR系统需处理不完美音频并适应不同用户群体，HRI中的识别环境更具挑战性，需评估ASR系统。

Method: 在八个公开数据集上评估四个最先进的ASR系统，数据集涵盖六种难度维度。

Result: 不同ASR系统在性能、幻觉倾向和固有偏差上有显著差异，虽在标准基准测试中得分相近。

Conclusion: 这些ASR系统的局限性对HRI的任务执行、用户信任和安全有严重影响。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can
interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

TL;DR: 提出FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，动态调整轨迹预测输出时间步，实验证明其有效性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型固定长度输出预测，难以适应动态场景，需更灵活的轨迹预测方法。

Method: 引入FSN框架，含预训练的Adaptive Prediction Module (APM)动态调整输出步长；设计Dynamic Decoder (DD)保证框架即插即用；设计评分机制平衡预测步长和准确性。

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上实验，证明FSN框架有效且灵活。

Conclusion: FSN框架能动态调整预测输出时间步，在轨迹预测中具有有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习策略多为“专家型”，只能掌握单一技能，需要开发能掌握多任务和多实体的通用策略。

Method: 结合行为克隆、微调与PPO，利用传感器运动词汇表和Transformer架构处理不同任务的观测和动作空间。

Result: Arnold在14个具有挑战性的控制任务中达到专家或超专家水平，支持高效多任务、多实体学习并能快速适应新任务。

Conclusion: 研究为生物运动控制提供见解，证实了肌肉协同作用跨任务可转移性有限的发现。

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

TL;DR: 提出SafeBimanual框架，优化预训练扩散策略，提升双手操作安全性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的双手操作策略学习方法忽略物理安全约束，导致危险行为。

Method: 设计不同成本函数施加安全约束，用视觉语言模型调度成本函数。

Result: 在8个模拟任务中成功率提升13.7%，不安全交互减少18.8%；在4个真实任务中成功率提升32.5%。

Conclusion: SafeBimanual框架能有效提升双手操作的安全性和成功率，有实用价值。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

TL;DR: 提出Xumi系统解决ACL配置复杂且依赖人工的问题，能加速配置流程、处理冲突和减少规则添加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ACL配置依赖大量人工，任务繁琐、易出错且难以扩展。

Method: 利用具备目标网络领域知识的大语言模型，自动将自然语言意图转换为完整ACL规则，检测规则冲突，在运营商指导下生成解决后的意图，确定最佳部署计划。

Result: Xumi相比现有做法将整个配置流程加速超10倍，能处理约100个冲突ACL，在现代云网络中减少约40%的规则添加。

Conclusion: Xumi能有效解决ACL配置难题，提高配置效率和质量。

Abstract: ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet
its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To
carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new
configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules,
(2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3)
deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts
for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone,
and impractical to scale.
  We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge
of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural
language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts.
Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and
generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally
identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while
satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire
configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses
O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud
network.

Conclusion: 通过示例和数值模拟验证了所提方法的有效性及样本复杂度界的增长率。

Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for
learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the
minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency
responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a
regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that
can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We
derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification
process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification
error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is
provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies.
Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an
example, along with numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the
sample complexity bound.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型作为黑盒模型存在可信性挑战，需要方法探查其对文本隐含知识的理解。

Method: 提出一种名为KnowProb的知识引导探测方法，给出基于文本潜在内容的六种解释。

Result: 验证了当前大小规模的PLMs仅学习单一表征分布，难以捕捉文本隐藏知识，所提方法能从多视角识别现有黑盒模型局限。

Conclusion: 所提方法有助于推动以可解释方式检测黑盒模型的研究。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

Result: 构建的图谱能捕捉真实法院判决中法律推理的完整结构，使隐含推理显式且机器可读；评估表明该系统从事实中检索相关法律条文比大语言模型基线和检索增强方法更准确。

Conclusion: 构建法律知识图谱的方法有效解决了现有自动方法在捕捉法律推理方面的局限，能更准确地检索相关法律条文。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

Motivation: 现有多模态领域的LSR方法依赖计算昂贵的对比预训练或从冻结的稠密模型蒸馏，限制了相互增强的潜力。

Method: 提出通过自知识蒸馏实现稠密和稀疏表示双向学习的框架，使用集成相似度分数作为共享教师信号，微调稠密编码器最后一层和稀疏投影头。

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k上的实验表明，稀疏检索器优于现有稀疏基线，性能与稠密模型相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 该框架能使稀疏模型在多模态检索任务中有效，同时保留稀疏模型的优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

Motivation: 大语言模型在文档重排序时单模型难以平衡细粒度相关性评分和整体跨文档分析。

Method: 采用双阶段方法，第一阶段用混合损失将教师模型的相关性信号蒸馏到学生模型；第二阶段添加LoRA适配器并在GPT - 4o生成的数据上微调。

Conclusion: 双损失蒸馏确保稳定校准，DeAR是现代重排序系统有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

Motivation: 虽已知标题框架对判断有影响，但对后续搜索行为的影响尚不明确，故开展研究。

Method: 进行对照实验，让参与者发出查询并从特定语言框架过滤的标题中选择。

Result: 标题框架显著影响后续查询，冲突和策略框架破坏与先前选择的一致性，情节框架比主题框架导致更具体的查询，且有短期框架持续性但随时间下降。

Conclusion: 即使短暂接触框架也能显著改变用户信息搜索行为的方向。

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

Motivation: LLM自动捆绑生成计算成本高，直接整合蒸馏知识会产生冲突影响性能。

Method: 提出RouteDK框架，先蒸馏两种互补知识，训练特定LoRA专家和基础专家，用动态融合模块和推理增强模块。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，RouteDK准确率与教师LLM相当或更好，计算效率高，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RouteDK能有效解决知识冲突问题，在自动捆绑生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Result: 实验展示了这些方法能满足实际需求。

Conclusion: 开启了在标签稀缺条件下评估准确性的讨论。

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Result: 在官方测试集的多数单语赛道排名接近前列，13种语言中有7种排名第一，但在零样本设置下表现欠佳。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案在单语赛道有较好表现，但在零样本设置中存在局限性。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

Conclusion: 全自动综述生成目前存在不足，还有待进一步提升。

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法是在不同不确定条件下大语言模型高效且鲁棒解码的原则性、即插即用方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Conclusion: GreenTEA能有效平衡探索与利用，实现自动提示优化，提升模型性能。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过本次调查，能更全面了解TTS中验证器方法及其应用。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CoT推理轨迹是否必须可解释才能提升LLM任务性能。

Method: 在开放式问答领域，对LLaMA和Qwen模型在四种推理轨迹上进行监督微调，并进行100人参与的人类受试者研究。

Result: 基于R1轨迹微调性能最强，但参与者认为其可解释性最差。

Conclusion: 将中间标记与最终用户可解释性解耦是有用的。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数缓解大语言模型幻觉工作侧重于事后过滤，本文想从设计触发幻觉的查询改写策略入手。

Method: 引入QueryBandits这一带子框架来设计改写策略，最大化基于输入查询17种语言特征敏感性的奖励模型。

Result: 顶级上下文QueryBandit（汤普森采样）在多种基准测试中有高胜率，远超无改写基线和零样本静态提示。

Conclusion: QueryBandits通过查询改写干预有效缓解幻觉，静态改写可能加重问题，且无统一改写策略，利用语义特征引导改写可改变输出行为。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

Method: 使用迷宫测试，综合意识理论的13个基本特征，在零样本、单样本和少样本学习场景下评估12个领先大语言模型。

Result: 推理能力强的大语言模型表现优于标准版本，Gemini 2.0 Pro完全路径准确率达52.9%，DeepSeek - R1部分路径准确率达80.5%，模型在解决方案中难以维持连贯的自我模型。

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过推理机制在意识相关行为上有进展，但缺乏意识所特有的综合、持续的自我意识。

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is
available at https://github.com/rpo19/ReFactX.

Method: 提出GRADE框架，从推理深度和语义距离两维度建模任务难度，构建合成多跳QA数据集，使用2D难度矩阵。

Result: 多领域和多模型实验表明错误率与难度度量强相关，验证了难度度量的诊断效用。

Conclusion: GRADE能对RAG性能进行细粒度分析，为评估和改进现实应用中的多跳推理提供可扩展基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

Result: 在2个跨语言任务和15个语言对的实验验证了BridgeX - ICL的有效性。

Conclusion: BridgeX - ICL方法有效，为大语言模型的多语言机制提供实证见解。

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

Result: SSFO显著优于现有方法，在多数据集达SOTA，有强泛化性。

Conclusion: SSFO是提升RAG系统忠实度的有效自监督方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

TL;DR: 本文探索基于案件事实的法律诉求生成问题，构建数据集、设计评估指标并评估大模型，指出当前模型局限并将公开数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注提高法律专业人士效率，帮助非专业人士（如原告）的研究较少，本文旨在探索基于案件事实的法律诉求生成问题。

Method: 构建首个中文法律诉求生成数据集ClaimGen - CN，设计评估指标，对通用和法律领域大语言模型进行零样本评估。

Result: 当前模型在事实准确性和表达清晰度方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该领域需要更有针对性的开发，为鼓励进一步探索将公开数据集。

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出阿拉伯通用性分数（AGS）量化词汇跨方言使用广度，结合多种方法标注语料并训练模型预测AGS，表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯方言NLP模型常将方言视为离散类别，ALDi将复杂变异简化为单一维度，需新方法。

Method: 提出AGS，结合词对齐、词源感知编辑距离和平滑处理标注平行语料，训练回归模型预测上下文中的AGS。

Result: 在多方言基准测试中，该方法优于包括最先进方言识别系统在内的强大基线。

Conclusion: AGS为建模词汇通用性提供了可扩展、基于语言学的方法，丰富了阿拉伯方言性的表示。

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理评估依赖静态基准和小规模人工研究，需更好评估方法。

Method: ATA结合静态代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和基于角色的对抗性测试生成，用LLM - as - a - Judge评分引导后续测试。

Result: ATA在旅行规划器和维基百科编写器上比专家注释者发现更多样和严重故障，用时短。去除代码分析和网页搜索会增加差异和校准误差。

Conclusion: ATA是有效的代理测试方法，证据驱动的测试生成有价值，已开源方法和实现便于可重复测试。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

Motivation: PPO虽在LM - RLHF中有效，但有启发式动机且对KL散度约束处理方式随意，需新方法。

Method: 开发新的动作价值RL方法KL - regularised Q - Learning (KLQ)。

Result: KLQ在优化LM - RLHF目标上与PPO表现相当，在大语言模型评估中胜率更高。

Conclusion: KLQ是LM - RLHF中PPO的有效替代方法。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育机构有大量学生反馈文本，但将其转化为有用见解困难，现有ABSA研究多聚焦商业领域，教育领域因数据稀缺难开展研究，急需高质量标注数据集。

Method: 创建EduRABSA数据集，涵盖三种评论主题类型和主要ABSA任务；开发ASQE - DPT数据处理工具，可从单任务标注生成综合ABSA任务的标注数据集。

Result: 提供了数据集、注释工具、脚本和统计信息，相关资源可在指定链接获取。

Conclusion: 这些资源消除了数据集障碍，支持研究的透明度和可重复性，推动ABSA社区和教育领域发展。

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

Result: 用两个基准数据集证明，用GRAID增强有害文本分类数据集可显著提升下游护栏模型性能

Conclusion: GRAID能有效解决有害文本分类数据稀缺问题，提升模型性能

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

Motivation: 当前AI基准测试存在难度与现实性的矛盾，需新评估范式。

Method: 从Stack Exchange收集未解决问题构建UQ测试集，结合规则过滤、LLM判断和人工审核保证问题质量，采用复合验证策略和开放平台进行评估。

Result: 顶级模型仅在15%的问题上通过UQ验证，初步人工验证已发现部分正确答案。

Conclusion: UQ为评估前沿模型在现实开放性挑战上提供路径，成功解决问题可推动人类知识边界，UQ已开源。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

Motivation: 大语言模型与期望行为对齐有挑战，现有激活调整方法在评估干预强度上有局限。

Method: 提出FASB框架，通过跟踪模型内部状态动态确定干预必要性和强度，加入回溯机制纠正偏差。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和六个选择题数据集上实验，方法优于基线。

Conclusion: FASB框架有效，代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在过度思考问题，导致性能下降，需缓解过度思考。

Method: 将推理分为三个阶段，确定推理完成点（RCP），挖掘RCP模式并开发基于启发式规则的轻量级阈值策略。

Result: 在基准测试中，所提出的方法减少了令牌消耗，同时保持或提升了推理准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效缓解大语言模型的过度思考问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

Motivation: DPO存在奖励破解问题，导致生成文本过长、缺乏多样性和知识遗忘，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出RoPO算法，用KL散度隐式约束输出层对数，在多粒度正交矩阵上微调显式约束中间隐藏状态。

Result: RoPO在AlpacaEval 2上提升3.27分，在MT - Bench上超最佳基线6.2到7.5分，仅用0.015%可训练参数。

Conclusion: RoPO能有效缓解DPO的奖励破解问题。

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

Motivation: 传统基于LoRA的大模型参数高效微调方法在下游任务与全参数微调有性能差距，要解决该问题。

Method: 提出DropLoRA，在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵间集成剪枝模块模拟动态子空间学习。

Result: 实验表明DropLoRA在LLaMA系列微调的多种大语言模型生成任务中始终优于LoRA。

Conclusion: DropLoRA能克服传统LoRA局限，在不增加训练和推理成本下显著提升性能。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

Motivation: Transformer模型处理长文档分类时因输入长度限制和计算效率问题表现不佳，需有效长文档分类方法。

Method: 利用TF - IDF排序策略选择最具信息的句子，评估三种上下文缩减策略。

Result: 保留前50%排序的句子可保持与全文推理相当的性能，减少最多35%的推理时间。

Conclusion: 句子排序是可扩展且高效的零样本长文档分类技术。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

Motivation: 现有NLP模型决策是黑箱，因果NLP旨在阐明文本特征因果效应，本文关注模型可解释性。

Method: 复制并扩展Bansal等人工作，开发基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构CausalSent。

Conclusion: 开发的CausalSent框架有效，能提高处理效应估计准确性，可用于分析文本特征因果效应。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments

study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

TL;DR: 本文介绍TextTopoOOD框架评估富文本网络中不同OOD场景的检测，提出TNT - OOD模型处理文本与拓扑结构的复杂关系，实验展示了评估挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略富文本网络中复杂的文本 - 结构多样性，本文旨在解决该问题。

Method: 引入TextTopoOOD框架评估不同OOD场景，提出TNT - OOD模型，用交叉注意力模块融合结构到文本表示，用超网络生成节点特定变换参数。

Result: 在11个数据集的四个OOD场景实验，展示了TextTopoOOD评估OOD检测的细微挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型有助于评估富文本网络中的OOD检测。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

Conclusion: 特定任务微调、多任务微调及模型合并在论证挖掘任务中各有效果，模型合并是平衡性能和计算成本的可行方案。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

Motivation: 大语言模型有泄露版权或专有数据风险，传统方法在内容生成后处理，可能导致敏感信息暴露。

Method: 使用版权材料的精选数据集训练神经网络分类器，在文本生成前检查模型内部状态，结合RAG系统，必要时停止生成或修改输出。

Result: 分析内部状态有效降低版权数据泄露风险，提供可扩展解决方案，能融入AI工作流。

Conclusion: 该方法可确保符合版权法规，在保证高质量文本生成的同时增强数据隐私和道德标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on
GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

Conclusion: 在学习到的跨语言隐空间应用去偏技术是提升去偏效果和跨语言迁移性的有效方法。

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型的组合动态提供了有价值的见解，凸显了不同的组合模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

TL;DR: 论文提出ILRe上下文压缩管道解决大语言模型长上下文处理问题，降低复杂度，提升处理速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文场景存在有效上下文长度短、计算复杂度高和内存开销大等局限。

Method: 引入Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe)上下文压缩管道，确定中间解码层，流式分块预填充编码上下文，按注意力分数召回令牌，提出多池化内核分配策略。

Result: 将预填充复杂度从 $O(L^2)$ 降至 $O(L)$，在长上下文场景性能相当或更好，无需额外训练和算子开发，能快速处理 $1M$ 令牌请求，在RULER - $1M$ 基准测试取得约79.8分。

Conclusion: ILRe有效解决大语言模型长上下文处理问题，提升处理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Motivation: 评估量化如何影响模型偏差，尤其关注对不同人口子群体的影响。

Method: 关注权重和激活量化策略，使用概率和基于生成文本的指标，在九个基准上评估不同架构和推理能力的模型。

Result: 量化对偏差影响复杂，能降低模型毒性、不显著影响情感，但在生成任务中会增加刻板印象和不公平性，尤其是在激进压缩下。

Conclusion: 在实际应用量化时，应仔细平衡效率和伦理考量。

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

Motivation: 自然语言到手语翻译因平行语料有限，现有方法在数据稀缺环境难以泛化，需要解决此局限。

Method: 提出AulSign方法，通过动态提示和上下文学习结合样本选择及后续手语关联利用大语言模型，将手语与自然语言简洁描述关联并指导模型使用。

Result: 在英语和意大利语上进行评估，使用SignBank+和意大利LaCAM CNR - ISTC数据集，在低数据场景表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: AulSign方法有效，有潜力增强针对代表性不足语言社区沟通技术的可及性和包容性。

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

Method: 提出正式且基于因果关系的检测规划标准，并将其转化为半自动化注释流程，应用于Gemma - 2 - 2B模型在MBPP代码生成基准和诗歌生成任务。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型规划的机制研究提供可重现和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Motivation: 联络中心领域存在隐私和数据稀缺问题，限制模型训练和评估，且该领域对话有自身特点，需新方法生成合成对话。

Method: 利用衍生通话属性作为监督信号指导生成，引入含18个指标的诊断框架评估输出，测试四种语言无关生成策略。

Result: 没有方法能在所有特征上表现出色，在不流畅性、情感和行为真实性方面有明显不足。

Conclusion: 诊断工具能暴露差距，可对跨语言合成对话进行细粒度评估和压力测试。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

Method: 引入MTalk - Bench基准，涵盖三个核心维度和九个情景及任务，采用Arena式评估和基于评分规则的评估相结合的双方法评估框架，由人类评估者和大语言模型评估模型和人类输出。

Result: S2S大模型在语义信息处理好，但副语言信息和环境声音感知差；增加回复长度恢复连贯性但牺牲效率；模态感知、特定任务设计表现更好。Arena和Rubrics排名一致互补，差距大时区分可靠；大语言模型评估与人类有偏差，有位置和长度偏差，非语言评估需文本注释才可靠。

Conclusion: 当前S2S评估存在局限，需要更强大、语音感知的评估框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在手术视频分析中，专家标注耗时昂贵，确定适合下游任务的预训练模型既关键又具挑战，SITE提供了解决方案。

Method: 对手术阶段识别的SITE进行形式化，在两个数据集上对LogME、H - Score和TransRate三个指标进行全面基准测试，开展消融研究。

Result: LogME（按最小子集得分聚合时）与微调精度最匹配；H - Score预测能力弱；TransRate常颠倒真实模型排名；候选模型性能相似时，可迁移性估计判别力下降。

Conclusion: 给出模型选择实用指南，指出未来朝特定领域指标、理论基础和交互式基准测试工具方向发展。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a cornerstone of modern machine
learning, allowing practitioners to achieve high performance with limited
labeled data. In surgical video analysis, where expert annotations are
especially time-consuming and costly, identifying the most suitable pre-trained
model for a downstream task is both critical and challenging.
Source-independent transferability estimation (SITE) offers a solution by
predicting how well a model will fine-tune on target data using only its
embeddings or outputs, without requiring full retraining. In this work, we
formalize SITE for surgical phase recognition and provide the first
comprehensive benchmark of three representative metrics, LogME, H-Score, and
TransRate, on two diverse datasets (RAMIE and AutoLaparo). Our results show
that LogME, particularly when aggregated by the minimum per-subset score,
aligns most closely with fine-tuning accuracy; H-Score yields only weak
predictive power; and TransRate often inverses true model rankings. Ablation
studies show that when candidate models have similar performances,
transferability estimates lose discriminative power, emphasizing the importance
of maintaining model diversity or using additional validation. We conclude with
practical guidelines for model selection and outline future directions toward
domain-specific metrics, theoretical foundations, and interactive benchmarking
tools.

Motivation: 探讨巴基斯坦女性经济机会的阻碍因素，因该国女性劳动力参与率处于世界较低水平。

Method: 参考2020 - 2021年劳动力调查数据，并对卡拉奇女性进行访谈。

Result: 发现城乡女性劳动力参与率差异大，女性集中在农业，就业脆弱，且面临育儿责任、骚扰安全风险、交通困难和家庭反对等阻碍。

Conclusion: 巴基斯坦女性经济机会受多种因素阻碍，需关注和解决这些问题以提升女性劳动力参与率。

Abstract: We provide a short note on the barriers shaping womens economic opportunities
in Pakistan, where female labor force participation remains among the lowest in
the world. Recent labor force surveys (2020-21) show a sharp rural-urban
divide: rural womens participation is 28 percent compared to 69 percent for
rural men, while urban womens participation is 10 percent compared to 66
percent for urban men. Unemployment is higher for women in both rural (7
percent) and urban (16 percent) areas than for men (5 and 6 percent,
respectively). Women are concentrated in agriculture (68 percent), with limited
roles in services (17 percent) and industry (15 percent). Most are in rural (51
percent) or home-based (30 percent) work, and only 14 percent are in formal
business settings. Employment status reflects high vulnerability, with 63
percent of rural women as unpaid contributing family workers compared to 17
percent of urban women. Interviews with women in Karachi highlight childcare
responsibilities, harassment and safety risks, transport difficulties, and
family opposition as major impediments.

Motivation: 现有研究对表亲婚姻对女性地位影响的观点矛盾，本文旨在提供新的量化证据。

Method: 利用2017 - 2018年巴基斯坦人口与健康调查中15068名已婚女性的数据进行研究。

Result: 表亲婚姻与女性参与有偿工作呈适度负相关，与家务和无偿劳动关联更强；表亲婚姻女性未获更高家庭地位，更易认同配偶暴力。

Conclusion: 表亲婚姻可能强化传统性别角色，限制女性经济和社会自主性。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of cousin marriage in shaping women's autonomy,
household status, and labor supply in Pakistan. Existing research offers
contradictory claims: some suggest that cousin marriage improves women's
position within the household, while others argue it limits their freedoms and
economic opportunities. Using data from 15,068 married women in the Pakistan
Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, this study provides new quantitative
evidence. Results indicate a modest negative association between cousin
marriage and women's participation in paid work, alongside a stronger link to
home-based and unpaid labor. Women in cousin marriages do not appear to gain
household status relative to those in non-cousin marriages and are more likely
to justify spousal violence, reflecting entrenched patriarchal norms. These
findings suggest that cousin marriage may reinforce traditional gender roles
and constrain women's economic and social autonomy.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Generative AI on software development
within the IT sector through a mixed-method approach, utilizing a survey
developed based on expert interviews. The preliminary results of an ongoing
survey offer early insights into how Generative AI reshapes personal
productivity, organizational efficiency, adoption, business strategy and job
insecurity. The findings reveal that 97% of IT workers use Generative AI tools,
mainly ChatGPT. Participants report significant personal productivity gain and
perceive organizational efficiency improvements that correlate positively with
Generative AI adoption by their organizations (r = .470, p < .05). However,
increased organizational adoption of AI strongly correlates with heightened

*Corey J. A. Bradshaw,Shana M. McDermott*

TL;DR: 研究表明人口增长放缓或老龄化与糟糕的经济社会结果无关联，低或负人口增长国家表现更好，应超越恐惧和政治化叙事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们常担忧人口减少或老龄化导致经济疲软和生活水平下降，但这种担忧多基于错误解读，研究旨在验证人口增长与经济社会结果的关联。

Method: 在全球范围研究国家数据，用九个社会经济表现指标进行分析。

Result: 没有证据表明人口增长放缓或老龄化与糟糕结果有关，低或负人口增长国家平均表现更好，国内时间序列也显示老龄和低增长人口表现更佳。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了常见假设，强调应超越恐惧和政治化叙事，更深入理解支撑社会繁荣的因素。

Abstract: Concerns about declining or ageing populations often centre on the fear that
fewer people will translate to a weaker economy and lower living standards. But
these fears are frequently based on oversimplified or misapplied
interpretations of economic models, and appear to be driven more by political
agendas rather than evidence. In reality, long-term prosperity depends more on
how societies invest in education, skills, and technology, not just how many
people they have. We examine national data at the global scale to test whether
slower population growth or ageing populations are linked to worse economic or
social outcomes. Using nine different indices of socio-economic performance
(domestic comprehensive wealth, income equality, research and development
expenditure, patent applications, human capital, corruption perception index,
freedom, planetary pressure-adjusted Human Development Index, healthy life
expectancy at birth), we find no evidence that they are. In fact, we find that
countries with low or negative population growth perform better on average for
all indicators, and that even within-country time series show that most older
and slower-growing populations fare better on average. These findings challenge
common assumptions and highlight the need to move beyond fear-based and
politically motivated narratives toward a more informed understanding of what
truly supports thriving societies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 惩罚作为促进合作的机制有效性存在争议，需研究其在不同合作环境中的影响。

Method: 进行大规模综合实验，改变14个公共物品博弈的参数，采样360个实验条件，收集7100名参与者的147618个决策，开发模型预测惩罚结果。

Result: 惩罚效果有显著异质性，开发的模型预测表现优于人类，发现多个影响惩罚效果的特征且多相互作用。

Conclusion: 将惩罚效果的争论焦点从是否有效转向具体条件，展示综合实验与机器学习结合可揭示复杂社会现象规律并产生新解释。

Abstract: Punishment as a mechanism for promoting cooperation has been studied
extensively for more than two decades, but its effectiveness remains a matter
of dispute. Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative
settings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters
that characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and
collecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal
striking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment
consistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)
ranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely
undermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To
characterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human
forecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in
new experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed
by contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.
all-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility
(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a
reward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to
influence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For
example, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of
punishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results
refocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it "works" to the
specific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our
study demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine
learning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions
between multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex
social phenomena.

Method: 提出构建使用理论自然语言指令、现有经验数据和AI训练知识的“通用”智能体的方法，并设计大量新游戏进行测试。

Result: 在预注册实验中，智能体预测人类游戏表现平均优于博弈论均衡和普通智能体，在新游戏中甚至比最相关的已发表人类数据预测更准。

Conclusion: 现代AI智能体应用理论到新场景时所需修改少，提供了一种可行的预测途径。

Abstract: Useful social science theories predict behavior across settings. However,
applying a theory to make predictions in new settings is challenging: rarely
can it be done without ad hoc modifications to account for setting-specific
factors. We argue that modern AI agents offer an alternative for applying
theory to novel settings, requiring minimal or no modifications. We present an
approach for building such "general" agents that use theory-grounded natural
language instructions, existing empirical data, and knowledge acquired by the
underlying AI during training. To demonstrate the approach in settings where no
data from that data-generating process exists--as is often the case in applied
prediction problems--we design a highly heterogeneous population of 883,320
novel games. AI agents are constructed using human data from a small set of
conceptually related, but structurally distinct "seed" games. In preregistered
experiments, on average, agents predict human play better than (i)
game-theoretic equilibria and (ii) out-of-the-box agents in a random sample of
1,500 games from the population. For a small set of separate novel games, these
simulations predict responses from a new sample of human subjects better even
than the most plausibly relevant published human data.

Abstract: In 2025, the UK Office for National Statistics released a novel dataset of
monthly inter-industry payment flows during January 2017 to November 2024 at
the 5-digit SIC level (ONS, 2025a), covering $>$3.1 million UK organizations.
Annual aggregates amount to 490 million transactions with an aggregate value of

Motivation: 新兴经济体中无组织药店在有组织和电子药品零售渠道竞争下面临生存挑战，需研究三渠道互动。

Method: 构建理论模型，考虑药品零售、消费者、零售商和产品特征，进行价格设定博弈。

Result: 产品类别需求不影响零售商最优定价策略；顾客对无组织零售商接受度增加会使无组织和有组织零售商利润下降；消费者到无组织零售商距离和运输成本增加，无组织零售商利润上升；消费者货币边际效用不影响最优价格但影响三渠道利润。

Conclusion: 研究结果为新兴经济体政策制定者实现三零售部门平衡增长提供有价值见解。

Abstract: The survival of unorganized pharmacies is increasingly challenging in the
face of growing competition from organized and e-pharmaceutical retail channels
in emerging economies. A theoretical model is developed to capture the
triple-channel interactions among unorganized, organized and e-retailing in
emerging markets, taking into account the essential features of the
pharmaceutical retail landscape, consumers, retailers and pharmaceutical
products. Given the retailer and customer-specific factors, the price-setting
game between the triple-channel retailers yielded the optimal prices for these
retailers. The analysis found that the product category level demand has no
influence on optimal pricing strategies of the retailers. The analysis also
reveals counterintuitive results, for instance, (i) an increase in customer
acceptance of unorganized retailers will result in a decrease in profits of
both unorganized and organized retailers; (ii) as the distance and
transportation cost to unorganized retailers increases for the consumers, the
profit of the unorganized retailer increases; and (iii) consumers marginal
utility of money has no influence on the optimal price, but have an influence
on the profit of the three retail channels. Our research findings offer
valuable insights for policymakers facing challenges in achieving a balanced
growth among the organized, unorganized, and e-pharmaceutical retail sectors in
emerging economies.

Motivation: Graph RAG从普通文档检索转向结构化图遍历引入了未充分探索的隐私风险，需研究其数据提取漏洞。

Method: 设计并执行定制的数据提取攻击，探测Graph RAG系统泄露原始文本和结构化数据的可能性。

Result: Graph RAG系统虽可能减少原始文本泄漏，但更易提取结构化的实体和关系信息。

Conclusion: 为Graph RAG的独特隐私挑战提供了基础分析，并为构建更安全系统提供见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enhancing
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date knowledge. Graph RAG has
emerged as an advanced paradigm that leverages graph-based knowledge structures
to provide more coherent and contextually rich answers. However, the move from
plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal introduces new,
under-explored privacy risks. This paper investigates the data extraction
vulnerabilities of the Graph RAG systems. We design and execute tailored data
extraction attacks to probe their susceptibility to leaking both raw text and
structured data, such as entities and their relationships. Our findings reveal
a critical trade-off: while Graph RAG systems may reduce raw text leakage, they
are significantly more vulnerable to the extraction of structured entity and
relationship information. We also explore potential defense mechanisms to
mitigate these novel attack surfaces. This work provides a foundational
analysis of the unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for
building more secure systems.

Conclusion: 数据质量和模型选择对开发强大的漏洞检测系统很重要，为未来高跨项目有效性的系统指明方向。

Abstract: The performance of AI-based software vulnerability detection systems is often
limited by their poor generalization to unknown codebases. In this research, we
explore the impact of data quality and model architecture on the
generalizability of vulnerability detection systems. By generalization we mean
ability of high vulnerability detection performance across different C/C++
software projects not seen during training. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate that improvements in dataset diversity and quality substantially
enhance detection performance. Additionally, we compare multiple encoder-only
and decoder-only models, finding that encoder based models outperform in terms
of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves 6.8% improvement in recall
on the benchmark BigVul[1] dataset, also outperforming on unseen projects,
hence showing enhanced generalizability. These results highlight the role of
data quality and model selection in the development of robust vulnerability
detection systems. Our findings suggest a direction for future systems having
high cross-project effectiveness.

Abstract: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has become a widely adopted model for securing
enterprise environments, promoting continuous verification and minimal trust
across systems. However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited,
despite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions
and being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust
frameworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure,
assuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This
paper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model
designed for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled
environments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a
six-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through
controls including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection,
secure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring,
and live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory
and security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap
and maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across
varying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and
standards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond
pre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust
principles. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and
provides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance
compliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges. Future research
may include empirical validation of the framework and cross-sector application
testing.

Result: 实验结果表明利用大语言模型完成此任务可行有效。

Conclusion: 该方法超越传统检测分类，能深入洞察恶意逻辑，为研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Android malware poses significant challenges to the
maintenance and security of mobile applications (apps). Traditional detection
techniques often struggle to keep pace with emerging malware variants that
employ advanced tactics such as code obfuscation and dynamic behavior
triggering. One major limitation of these approaches is their inability to
localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level, hindering precise
understanding of malicious behavior. This gap in understanding makes the design
of effective and targeted mitigation strategies difficult, leaving mobile apps
vulnerable to continuously evolving threats.
  To address this gap, we propose MalLoc, a novel approach that leverages the
code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to localize
malicious payloads at a fine-grained level within Android malware. Our
experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using
LLMs for this task, highlighting the potential of MalLoc to enhance precision
and interpretability in malware analysis. This work advances beyond traditional
detection and classification by enabling deeper insights into behavior-level
malicious logic and opens new directions for research, including dynamic
modeling of localized threats and targeted countermeasure development.

Method: 提出“LLM 守门人”概念，使用轻量级本地运行模型在用户查询发送到云端大语言模型前过滤敏感信息。

Result: 通过人体实验表明，双模型方法在增强用户隐私的同时只引入极小开销，且不影响大语言模型回复质量。

Conclusion: “LLM 守门人”能有效解决大语言模型隐私保护问题。

Abstract: The interactive nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which closely track
user data and context, has prompted users to share personal and private
information in unprecedented ways. Even when users opt out of allowing their
data to be used for training, these privacy settings offer limited protection
when LLM providers operate in jurisdictions with weak privacy laws, invasive
government surveillance, or poor data security practices. In such cases, the
risk of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information
(PII), being mishandled or exposed remains high. To address this, we propose
the concept of an "LLM gatekeeper", a lightweight, locally run model that
filters out sensitive information from user queries before they are sent to the
potentially untrustworthy, though highly capable, cloud-based LLM. Through
experiments with human subjects, we demonstrate that this dual-model approach
introduces minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without
compromising the quality of LLM responses.

data poisoning, adversarial, deepfake, and adversarial spoofing attacks. We
chronologically trace the development of voice authentication and examine how
vulnerabilities have evolved in tandem with technological advancements. For
each category of attack, we summarize methodologies, highlight commonly used
datasets, compare performance and limitations, and organize existing literature
using widely accepted taxonomies. By highlighting emerging risks and open
challenges, this survey aims to support the development of more secure and

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled agents are rapidly emerging across a wide
range of applications, but their deployment introduces vulnerabilities with
security implications. While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks
(e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration),
time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this
context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or
API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks
such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we
present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We
introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to
evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection
and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose
prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study
highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25%
detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in
vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When
combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an
executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction
at the intersection of AI safety and systems security.

Conclusion: LLM安全存在亟待解决的漏洞，需要AI安全社区协同检测、审计并制定政策。

Abstract: We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM
security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into
model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1)
hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial
prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with
attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert
information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate
speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five
stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection
defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining.
Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for
coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety
community.

Conclusion: 该框架的双重增强能力为开发能应对不断演变网络威胁的自适应防御系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security
defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models
is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these
issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework
\textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL
Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios.
Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1)
the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through
adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2)
the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using
reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate
that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is
highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection
capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for
developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber
threats.

Abstract: The escalating complexity and volume of cyberattacks demand proactive
detection strategies that go beyond traditional rule-based systems. This paper
presents a phase-aware, multi-model machine learning framework that emulates
adversarial behavior across the seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain using the
MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise dataset. Techniques are semantically mapped to phases
via ATTACK-BERT, producing seven phase-specific datasets. We evaluate LightGBM,
a custom Transformer encoder, fine-tuned BERT, and a Graph Neural Network
(GNN), integrating their outputs through a weighted soft voting ensemble.
Inter-phase dependencies are modeled using directed graphs to capture attacker
movement from reconnaissance to objectives. The ensemble consistently achieved
the highest scores, with F1-scores ranging from 97.47% to 99.83%, surpassing
GNN performance (97.36% to 99.81%) by 0.03%--0.20% across phases. This
graph-driven, ensemble-based approach enables interpretable attack path
forecasting and strengthens proactive cyber defense.

TL;DR: 提出模块化神经影像框架处理fMRI数据，在年龄和流体智力预测上表现优于现有方法，为fMRI分析提供新选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型难以处理fMRI数据的高维性、计算复杂性及复杂时空动态和间接感兴趣区域交互问题。

Method: 提出模块化框架，先使用局部掩码自编码器（LMAE）预训练，接着用随机游走专家混合模块（RWMOE）聚类特征，最后用基于状态空间模型（SSM）的预测器进行下游任务推理。

Result: 在Cam - CAN数据集上，年龄预测平均绝对误差为5.343，流体智力预测为2.940，皮尔逊相关系数分别为0.928和0.887，优于现有方法，且专家分布权重可视化可识别关键脑区。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于大语言模型的fMRI分析提供了稳健、可解释的替代方案，为脑衰老和认知功能研究提供新见解。

Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI plays a critical
role in personalized predictions such as age and cognitive performance.
However, applying foundation models(FM) to fMRI data remains challenging due to
its high dimensionality, computational complexity, and the difficulty in
capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and indirect region-of-interest (ROI)
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a modular neuroimaging
framework that integrates principles from FM with efficient, domain-specific
architectures. Our approach begins with a Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE) for
pretraining, which reduces the influence of hemodynamic response function (HRF)
dynamics and suppresses noise. This is followed by a Random Walk Mixture of
Experts (RWMOE) module that clusters features across spatial and temporal
dimensions, effectively capturing intricate brain interactions. Finally, a
state-space model (SSM)-based predictor performs downstream task inference.
Evaluated on the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN)
dataset, our framework achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.343 for age
prediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence, with Pearson correlation
coefficients (PCCs) of 0.928 and 0.887, respectively-outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods. Visualization of expert distribution weights further
enhances interpretability by identifying key brain regions. This work provides
a robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis,
offering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function.

TL;DR: 文章探讨支持Final Four选举中简单Condorcet投票法的规范原则，证明原则可唯一表征该方法，并提出扩展至五人及以上选举的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Condorcet投票在无Condorcet赢家时，四人以上选举有多种合理规则，需确定支持Final Four选举中简单Condorcet投票法的规范原则。

Method: 确定一个相对无争议的充分条件判断候选人接近Condorcet赢家的程度，用其他原则解决该条件无法判定的情况。

Result: 证明原则能唯一表征Final Four选举的简单Condorcet投票法，提出五人选举新方法并给出表征该方法的充分原则。

Conclusion: 所提原则可表征Final Four选举方法，新扩展方法简单且有相应原则支持。

Abstract: Proponents of Condorcet voting face the question of what to do in the rare
case when no Condorcet winner exists. Recent work provides compelling arguments
for the rule that should be applied in three-candidate elections, but already
with four candidates, many rules appear reasonable. In this paper, we consider
a recent proposal of a simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four political
elections. Our question is what normative principles could support this simple
form of Condorcet voting. When there is no Condorcet winner, one natural
principle is to pick the candidate who is closest to being a Condorcet winner.
Yet there are multiple plausible ways to define closeness, leading to different
results. Here we take the following approach: identify a relatively
uncontroversial sufficient condition for one candidate to be closer than
another to being a Condorcet winner; then use other principles to help settle
who wins in cases when that condition alone does not. We prove that our
principles uniquely characterize the simple Condorcet voting method for Final
Four elections. This analysis also points to a new way of extending the method
to elections with five or more candidates that is simpler than an extension
previously considered. The new proposal is to elect the candidate with the most
head-to-head wins, and if multiple candidates tie for the most wins, then elect
the one who has the smallest head-to-head loss. We provide additional
principles sufficient to characterize this simple method for Final Five
elections.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs实际应用受限于精度问题，本文旨在提升其精度。

Method: 提出SI - MSPINNs和RFF - MSPINNs两种方法，前者结合SI - MSNNs和PINNs核心机制，提取残差的主导频谱模式指导网络初始化；后者结合随机傅里叶特征与频谱加权方法，动态调整频率采样分布。

Result: 通过对Burgers方程和Helmholtz方程的实验验证，两种模型显著提高了原始PINNs的精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种方法能有效提升PINNs的精度。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are becoming a popular method for
solving PDEs, due to their mesh-free nature and their ability to handle
high-dimensional problems where traditional numerical solvers often struggle.
Despite their promise, the practical application of PINNs is still constrained
by several fac- tors, a primary one being their often-limited accuracy. This
paper is dedicated to enhancing the accuracy of PINNs by introducing
spectral-prior guided multistage strategy. We propose two methods: Spectrum-
Informed Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SI-MSPINNs) and
Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Spectrum Weighted Random
Fourier Features (RFF-MSPINNs). The SI-MSPINNs integrate the core mechanism of
Spectrum-Informed Multistage Neural Network (SI-MSNNs) and PINNs, in which we
extract the Dominant Spectral Pattern (DSP) of residuals by the discrete
Fourier transform. This DSP guides the network initialization to alleviate
spectral bias, and gradually optimizes the resolution accuracy using a
multistage strategy. The RFF-MSPINNs combines random Fourier features with
spectral weighting methods, dynamically adjusting the frequency sampling
distribution based on the residual power spectral density, allowing the network
to prioritize learning high-energy physical modes. Through experimental
verification of the Burgers equation and the Helmholtz equation, we show that
both models significantly improve the accuracy of the original PINNs.

Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method
for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the
Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep
Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with
convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact
solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep
neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in
terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and
the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the
number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of
input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of
the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Elliptic interface problems arise in numerous scientific and engineering
applications, modeling heterogeneous materials in which physical properties
change discontinuously across interfaces. In this paper, we present
\textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a
class of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump
conditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout
the domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source
evaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification
with reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be
performed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of
the Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we
use our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that
outputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our
solution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our
estimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\mathcal{O}(1 /
\sqrt{\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize
naturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that
have irregular geometry and in up to dimension six. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to highlight its potential in
solving problems motivated by real-world applications.

Abstract: These lecture notes evolve around mathematical concepts arising in inverse
problems. We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as
differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval. This
then leads us to the framework of well-posedness and first considerations
regarding reconstruction and inversion approaches. The second chapter then
first deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert
spaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of
convergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the
question of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly
focus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional
spaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which
allow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach. The intersection
between inverse problems and machine learning is a rapidly growing field and
our exposition here restricts itself to a very limited selection of topics.
Among them are learned regularization, fully-learned Bayesian estimation,
post-processing strategies and plug-n-play methods.

Abstract: User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender
systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to
simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain
alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale
simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is
the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such
feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is
often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference
alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the
efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering
mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we
introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in
RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.
Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate
cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing
ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty
estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation
samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using
such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.
Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the
alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of
fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when
interacting with RSs. We believe our work will advance the RS community and
offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.

Motivation: 预测VR中用户意图对创造沉浸式体验至关重要，尤其是涉及复杂抓握动作且需要精确触觉反馈的任务。

Method: 利用手部运动时间序列数据，在810次不同物体类型、大小和操作的试验中评估分类和回归方法。

Result: 分类模型难以在用户间泛化，表现不稳定；回归方法（尤其LSTM网络）表现更稳健，抓握前两秒关键窗口内时间误差在0.25秒内，距离误差约5 - 20厘米，但预测精确手部姿势仍难。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型有潜力增强VR交互，特别是通过自适应触觉反馈，为VR中用户动作实时预测的未来发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating
immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions
where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage
time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and
regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and
manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to
generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast,
regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within
0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second
window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand
postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user
variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and
how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user
behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models
to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and
lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user
actions in VR.

Conclusion: 人类对推理文本的解读与模型使用方式存在根本差距，应将推理文本视为待研究的产物，理解模型使用语言的非人类方式是关键研究方向。

Abstract: A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before
producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into
their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and
interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this
text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we
investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to
identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We
evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual
measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only
29.3%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating
the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a
fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use
it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that
reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken
at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use
language is a critical research direction.

Result: 用户研究SUS得分80.5，表明可用性佳，对比评估显示具身界面能显著提升用户对系统智能的感知。

Conclusion: 基于语言的推理和具身性在以用户为中心的AR导航系统设计中很重要且有潜力。

Abstract: Delivering intelligent and adaptive navigation assistance in augmented
reality (AR) requires more than visual cues, as it demands systems capable of
interpreting flexible user intent and reasoning over both spatial and semantic
context. Prior AR navigation systems often rely on rigid input schemes or
predefined commands, which limit the utility of rich building data and hinder
natural interaction. In this work, we propose an embodied AR navigation system
that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a multi-agent
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to support flexible,
language-driven goal retrieval and route planning. The system orchestrates
three language agents, Triage, Search, and Response, built on large language
models (LLMs), which enables robust interpretation of open-ended queries and
spatial reasoning using BIM data. Navigation guidance is delivered through an
embodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance
user experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS)
score of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show
that the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of
system intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of
language-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR
navigation systems.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the demand for communication devices has increased
among individuals with mobility and speech impairments. Eye-gaze tracking has
emerged as a promising solution for hands-free communication; however,
traditional appearance-based interfaces often face challenges such as accuracy
issues, involuntary eye movements, and difficulties with extensive command
sets. This work presents a multimodal appearance-based gaze-controlled virtual
keyboard that utilises deep learning in conjunction with standard camera
hardware, incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous modes for command
selection. The virtual keyboard application supports menu-based selection with
nine commands, enabling users to spell and type up to 56 English characters,
including uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, and a delete function
for corrections. The proposed system was evaluated with twenty able-bodied
participants who completed specially designed typing tasks using three input
modalities: (i) a mouse, (ii) an eye-tracker, and (iii) an unmodified webcam.
Typing performance was measured in terms of speed and information transfer rate
(ITR) at both command and letter levels. Average typing speeds were 18.3+-5.31
letters/min (mouse), 12.60+-2.99letters/min (eye-tracker, synchronous), 10.94
+- 1.89 letters/min (webcam, synchronous), 11.15 +- 2.90 letters/min
(eye-tracker, asynchronous), and 7.86 +- 1.69 letters/min (webcam,
asynchronous). ITRs were approximately 80.29 +- 15.72 bits/min (command level)
and 63.56 +- 11 bits/min (letter level) with webcam in synchronous mode. The
system demonstrated good usability and low workload with webcam input,
highlighting its user-centred design and promise as an accessible communication
tool in low-resource settings.

problems at the intersection of responsible AI and accessibility practices,
navigated contradictions between accessibility and responsible AI guidelines,
identified gaps in data about users with disabilities, and gathered support for
addressing the needs of disabled stakeholders by leveraging informal volunteer

interest and create an unpleasant experience for the users. Moreover, the
recommendation system being a black box creates comprehensibility and
transparency issues. This paper investigates social media recommendations from
an end user perspective. For the investigation, we used the popular social
media platform Facebook and recruited regular users to conduct a qualitative
analysis. We asked participants about the social media content suggestions,
their comprehensibility, and explainability. Our analysis shows users mostly
require explanation whenever they encounter unfamiliar content and to ensure
their online data security. Furthermore, the users require concise,
non-technical explanations along with the facility of controlled information
flow. In addition, we observed that explanations impact the users perception of
transparency, trust, and understandability. Finally, we have outlined some
design implications and presented a synthesized framework based on our data
analysis.

TL;DR: 提出TextOnly统一功能门户，通过单一文本框输入文本访问多应用文本相关功能，集成LLM和BERT模型，用户研究证明其有效性和优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户访问特定文本框输入需多步操作的问题。

Method: 提出TextOnly，集成大语言模型（LLM）和BERT模型，LLM提供通用知识，BERT学习用户偏好。

Result: 真实用户研究中top - 1准确率达71.35%，能持续提升准确率和推理速度，用户认为可用性满意，偏好TextOnly，比语音助手支持更多文本功能、输入更简洁。

Conclusion: TextOnly是有效的统一功能门户，能有效解决用户操作问题，有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Text boxes serve as portals to diverse functionalities in today's smartphone
applications. However, when it comes to specific functionalities, users always
need to navigate through multiple steps to access particular text boxes for
input. We propose TextOnly, a unified function portal that enables users to
access text-related functions from various applications by simply inputting
text into a sole text box. For instance, entering a restaurant name could
trigger a Google Maps search, while a greeting could initiate a conversation in
WhatsApp. Despite their brevity, TextOnly maximizes the utilization of these
raw text inputs, which contain rich information, to interpret user intentions
effectively. TextOnly integrates large language models(LLM) and a BERT model.
The LLM consistently provides general knowledge, while the BERT model can
continuously learn user-specific preferences and enable quicker predictions.
Real-world user studies demonstrated TextOnly's effectiveness with a top-1
accuracy of 71.35%, and its ability to continuously improve both its accuracy
and inference speed. Participants perceived TextOnly as having satisfactory
usability and expressed a preference for TextOnly over manual executions.
Compared with voice assistants, TextOnly supports a greater range of
text-related functions and allows for more concise inputs.

Result: 在触摸屏指向任务中，这些改进显著提升了智能体学习准确触摸行为的能力。

Conclusion: 为HCI研究者提供开发类人交互保真度生物力学模型的实用技巧和训练方法。

Abstract: Biomechanical forward simulation holds great potential for HCI, enabling the
generation of human-like movements in interactive tasks. However, training
biomechanical models with reinforcement learning is challenging, particularly
for precise and dexterous movements like those required for touchscreen
interactions on mobile devices. Current approaches are limited in their
interaction fidelity, require restricting the underlying biomechanical model to
reduce complexity, and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose
practical improvements to training routines that reduce training time, increase
interaction fidelity beyond existing methods, and enable the use of more
complex biomechanical models. Using a touchscreen pointing task, we demonstrate
that curriculum learning, action masking, more complex network configurations,
and simple adjustments to the simulation environment can significantly improve
the agent's ability to learn accurate touch behavior. Our work provides HCI
researchers with practical tips and training routines for developing better
biomechanical models of human-like interaction fidelity.

Abstract: The lack of standardization across Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR)
datasets limits reproducibility, comparability, and research efficiency. We
introduce WHAR datasets, an open-source library designed to simplify WHAR data
handling through a standardized data format and a configuration-driven design,
enabling reproducible and computationally efficient workflows with minimal
manual intervention. The library currently supports 9 widely-used datasets,
integrates with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is easily extensible to new
datasets. To demonstrate its utility, we trained two state-of-the-art models,
TinyHar and MLP-HAR, on the included datasets, approximately reproducing
published results and validating the library's effectiveness for
experimentation and benchmarking. Additionally, we evaluated preprocessing
performance and observed speedups of up to 3.8x using multiprocessing. We hope
this library contributes to more efficient, reproducible, and comparable WHAR
research.

Motivation: 现实世界网络存在高阶关系且随时间演变，现有研究需捕捉这种动态，同时发现网络高阶动态的两个重要特征。

Method: 提出LINCOLN方法，采用双交互超边编码处理短期模式，周期性时间注入和中间节点表示处理长期模式。

Result: LINCOLN在动态超边预测任务中优于9种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LINCOLN方法能有效学习现实世界网络的高阶动态。

Abstract: Real-world networks have high-order relationships among objects and they
evolve over time. To capture such dynamics, many works have been studied in a
range of fields. Via an in-depth preliminary analysis, we observe two important
characteristics of high-order dynamics in real-world networks: high-order
relations tend to (O1) have a structural and temporal influence on other
relations in a short term and (O2) periodically re-appear in a long term. In
this paper, we propose LINCOLN, a method for Learning hIgh-order dyNamiCs Of
reaL-world Networks, that employs (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for
short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection and (3) intermediate node
representation for long-term patterns. Via extensive experiments, we show that
LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in the dynamic hyperedge
prediction task.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级ViT模型SAEViT以平衡计算效率和性能，显著降低计算复杂度，在主流数据集实验中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT模型尺寸大、计算成本高且局部特征建模能力弱，阻碍其在实际场景应用，需平衡计算效率和性能。

Method: 引入SAA模块进行自适应稀疏采样和反卷积，开发CIFFN层增强通道信息交换，设计含DWSConv的分层金字塔结构。

Result: 在ImageNet - 1K分类任务中，分别以0.8 GFLOPs和1.3 GFLOPs达到76.3%和79.6%的Top - 1准确率。

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Result: 建立了基线，部署了模型，通过案例研究展示框架效果。

Conclusion: 框架为超材料结构-表征-属性关系的集成设计和理解迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Method: 开发 Obz AI 软件生态系统，提供从 Python 客户端库到全栈分析仪表板的无缝集成管道。

Result: 机器学习工程师可轻松融入先进 XAI 方法，提取分析特征进行异常检测，实时监控 AI 模型。

Conclusion: Obz AI 使深度模型决策机制可解释，促进计算机视觉系统的可观测性和负责任部署。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were

Motivation: 大规模视觉Transformer在FGVC领域决策过程缺乏可解释性，而FGVC在生物多样性监测和医学诊断等领域需高可信度和可验证性。

Method: 引入The Loupe模块插入预训练骨干网络，用复合损失函数端到端训练，无需显式部分级注释。

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，提升性能同时提供清晰可视化解释。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

Conclusion: 文中未提及具体结论。

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

Result: 应用GRPO使中型VLM召回率提升达6%，OCR+LLM管道有布局盲和延迟问题。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究实现强大、全视觉的医疗报告理解。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

Result: 在456张H&E染色全切片图像数据集上，CellEcoNet预测性能优越（AUC:77.8% HR:9.54），优于IASLC分级系统等。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet在预后预测上表现良好，能解码肿瘤微环境细胞语言，带来范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

TL;DR: 提出高斯基元优化（GPO）框架用于视网膜图像配准，在FIRE数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于学习的框架在视网膜图像配准中因大均匀区域和稀疏血管特征导致梯度信号有限，配准困难。

Method: 引入GPO框架，先粗对齐，提取关键点作为基于描述符的控制节点（DCN），将节点建模为高斯基元，用KNN高斯插值构建位移场，通过多术语损失端到端优化。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，GPO将目标配准误差从6.2px降至~2.4px，25px处的AUC从0.770提高到0.938，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO框架能有效解决视网膜图像配准难题，提高配准性能。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results
on the test dataset to meticulously detect Deepfake images.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型难以保持强语义一致性，生成视频常偏离提示细节。

Method: 提出SSG - DiT框架，采用解耦两阶段过程，第一阶段生成空间感知视觉提示，结合原文本形成联合条件，通过SSG - Adapter注入冻结的视频DiT骨干，有双分支注意力机制。

Result: SSG - DiT在VBench基准的多个关键指标上表现优于现有模型，尤其在空间关系控制和整体一致性方面。

Conclusion: SSG - DiT是一种高效的高保真可控视频生成框架，能有效解决语义一致性问题。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

Motivation: ViT优化局限于单个图像的局部关系建模，难以捕捉数据点间的全局几何关系。

Method: 提出将ViT与近端工具集成的框架，ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切丛，引入近端迭代在切丛内定义截面并将数据从切空间投影到基空间。

Result: 所提方法在分类准确率和数据分布上优于传统ViT。

Conclusion: 所提统一几何优化方法能有效增强特征表示和分类性能。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出混合框架CE - RS - SBCIT用于脑肿瘤诊断，在MRI数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤早期检测和准确分类至关重要，但传统CNN和Transformer在MRI数据诊断中有诸多挑战。

Method: 引入CE - RS - SBCIT框架，结合基于残差和空间学习的CNN与Transformer模块，有四项核心创新。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的MRI数据集上评估，准确率达98.30%，灵敏度98.08%，F1分数98.25%，精度98.43%。

Conclusion: CE - RS - SBCIT框架在脑肿瘤诊断中表现出色，能有效解决传统方法的问题。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

Conclusion: 该框架能增强态势感知，在资源受限环境也能及时发出警报。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL优于无训练剪枝方法，在同等监督下超越基于训练的方法。

Conclusion: CoViPAL是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能在不影响精度的情况下提高LVLMs推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: 该工作有望推动基于DNN的模型迈向人类级智能。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Conclusion: 该方法为肌肉减少症评估和检测的全自动化提供了途径。

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark

Motivation: 评估大型视觉语言模型在半结构化表格图像上的复杂数值和跨语言推理能力。

Method: 创建包含合成记分卡图像和英文问答对的MMCRICBENCH - 3K基准，分英文和印地文子集进行测试。

Result: 即使是最先进的LVLMs在英文子集表现不佳，在印地文子集表现更差。

Conclusion: LVLMs在结构感知视觉文本理解、数值推理和跨语言泛化方面存在关键局限，公开数据集推动相关研究。

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured
tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated
scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English
QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English
scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical
data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results
show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,
and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging
Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM
research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有图像到图像生成方法为每种条件训练单独控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源利用低效。

Method: 提出UniGen框架，含CoMoE模块聚合语义相似特征并分配给专家模块，提出WeaveNet机制实现主干与控制分支信息交互。

Result: 在Subjects - 200K和MultiGen - 20M数据集的各种条件图像生成任务中达SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法在通用性和有效性上有优势。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

TL;DR: 提出Joint Parameter Selection (JPS)方法解决领域泛化中全量微调问题，理论推导泛化误差界，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全量微调会损害预训练模型的固有泛化能力，需参数高效的适应策略。

Method: 引入JPS方法，限制更新少量稀疏参数；理论上推导考虑参数更新稀疏性的泛化误差界；实践中设计双算子选择机制识别和更新跨源域梯度一致且显著的参数。

Result: 在大量基准实验中，JPS比现有领域泛化方法表现更优。

Conclusion: JPS方法兼具效率和有效性。

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Motivation: 将联邦学习应用于行人重识别系统面临非IID数据导致的统计异质性和大规模模型频繁传输带来的高通讯开销问题。

Method: 提出FedKLPR框架，包含KLL、KLPWA、SAS、CRR四个关键组件。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上实验表明，FedKLPR能显著降低通讯成本，ResNet - 50降低33% - 38%，ResNet - 34降低20% - 40%，模型精度下降控制在1%以内。

Conclusion: FedKLPR是一个有效、轻量级且通讯高效的行人重识别联邦学习框架。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Motivation: 解决在无昂贵标签数据下训练AI图像理解模型的挑战，利用DINO和Barlow Twins优势克服其局限性。

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略结合，在MS COCO数据集用10%标签数据训练混合模型。

Result: 混合方法与DINO有相当的损失和分类准确率，有强特征表示，注意力可视化显示语义分割能力提升。

Conclusion: 该组合方法为资源受限环境下训练ViTs提供可扩展、标签高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 低资源地区甘蔗种植者缺乏可扩展、高效和可解释的工具应对叶病，现有深度学习模型在现实条件下泛化能力差且资源需求大。

Method: 创建SugarcaneLD - BD数据集，结合其他两个数据集；优化SugarcaneShuffleNet模型；通过迁移学习和贝叶斯优化微调其他轻量级卷积神经网络作对比；将SugarcaneShuffleNet集成到SugarcaneAI应用。

Result: SugarcaneShuffleNet模型大小9.26 MB，准确率98.02%，F1分数0.98，平均推理时间4.14 ms/图像；MnasNet和EdgeNeXt准确率相当但资源需求大。

Conclusion: 研究成果提供了多样化基准、适用于低资源环境的高效模型和实用的甘蔗疾病分类工具。

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Motivation: 现有MRI工作流程碎片化，深度学习方法缺乏泛化性，且未整合图像与语言信息。

Method: 在大规模异质语料上训练，采用多阶段训练范式，包括自监督视觉预训练、视觉 - 语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令微调。

Result: OmniMRI能在单一架构中执行多种任务，如重建、分割、检测、诊断建议和报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将碎片化流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，推动成像与临床语言统一的基础模型发展。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

to account for dynamic motion and computational constraints. We show that Vroom
is able to partially recover track and vehicle trajectories in complex

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合针对性损失优化和预处理能更好表征白血病细胞形态，为ALL识别和分型提供准确高效工具。

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,

Conclusion: 所提出的TMR检测器和新数据集RPINE在少样本模式检测任务中有效且具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

Result: 在多个数据集评估，QTT - SEG提升了SAM零样本性能，在多数二分类任务中三分钟内超越AutoGluon Multimodal，多分类数据集上也有增益。

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出基于MLLM先验的免训练框架实现即时偏好对齐的文本到图像生成，优于先前方法，支持多轮交互细化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法难以实时且免训练地实现偏好对齐，依赖静态偏好或微调，适应性不足。

Method: 将任务解耦为偏好理解和偏好引导生成两部分，利用MLLM提取偏好信号并丰富提示，集成全局关键词控制和局部区域感知交叉注意力调制来引导扩散模型。

Result: 在Viper数据集和收集的基准上的实验表明，该方法在定量指标和人工评估中均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于对话的生成和MLLM - 扩散集成开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Motivation: CT成像原始数据采集时，欠采样和噪声等会导致重建图像有伪影和噪声，传统校正方法缺乏泛化性。

Method: 提出UniSino模型，在投影域直接标准化数据，训练框架融入正弦图物理特性。

Result: 在单欠采样和混合欠采样情况下，UniSino均实现了更优的重建质量，在正弦图增强中表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniSino是一个有效的通用CT正弦图标准化基础模型，可用于CT成像的正弦图增强。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Motivation: 现代计算机视觉模型处理医学影像任务时，数据稀缺限制从头训练模型的效果，前人研究发现特定预训练可提升性能，本文旨在扩展研究确定最佳CNN架构和对比预训练效果。

Method: 进行全面调查确定用于乳腺病变恶性检测和ACL撕裂检测的最佳CNN架构，进行统计分析对比RadImageNet和ImageNet预训练对下游模型性能的影响。

Result: 1维卷积分类器、ResNet50预训练骨干和部分骨干解冻能实现最佳下游医学分类性能，ACL撕裂检测AUC为0.9969，乳腺结节恶性检测AUC为0.9641，结果有竞争力。

Conclusion: 未找到证据证实RadImageNet预训练在ACL撕裂和乳腺病变分类任务中能提供更优的下游性能。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，代码将公开。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法轻量级、可解释且有效，适用于静态图像和视频帧，适合自动化内容验证和数字取证的现实应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Method: 提出集成U - Net分割和分类模型的深度学习框架，用Herlev Pap Smear Dataset训练评估，对比分割与未分割图像训练的模型。

Result: 使用分割图像使模型精度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，分类性能更平衡，但分割对分类性能影响有限。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: 动态推理 - 感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases

Conclusion: CL用于医学影像自适应VAD具有可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Result: 不同CAM方法的噪声敏感性存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 所提出的鲁棒性指标具有适用性。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future

Conclusion: 提出的新方法有效解决大脑信号不一致问题，能在视觉 - 大脑理解任务中取得优异性能。

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: The urgent need for renewable energy expansion, particularly wind power, is
hindered by conflicts with wildlife conservation. To address this, we developed
BirdRecorder, an advanced AI-based anti-collision system to protect endangered
birds, especially the red kite (Milvus milvus). Integrating robotics,

By combining these components, BirdRecorder outperforms existing approaches in
both accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 揭示不同模型间存在显著性能差异，发现领先模型如GPT - 4o常有幻觉问题。

Conclusion: SpotEdit能有效评估视觉引导图像编辑方法，可推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at
https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/SpotEdit.

  system provides environmental information beyond the current view using
historical memories.
  Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05%
performance drop
  on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9),
outperforming smaller
  models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The
system maintains
  response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial
speech output, substantially
  faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Abstract: Particle methods play an important role in computational fluid dynamics, but
they are among the most difficult to implement and solve. The most common
method is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, which is suitable for problem
settings that involve large deformations, such as tsunamis and dam breaking.
However, the calculation can become unstable depending on the distribution of
particles. In contrast, the neural particle method has high computational
stability for various particle distributions is a machine learning method that
approximates velocity and pressure in a spatial domain using neural networks.
The neural particle method has been extended to viscous flows, but until now it
has been limited to incompressible flows. In this paper, we propose the
compressible neural particle method, which is a new feed-forward neural
network-based method that extends the original neural particle method to model
compressible viscous fluid flows. The proposed method uses neural networks to
calculate the velocity and pressure of fluid particles at the next time step,
and the Tait equation to calculate the density to handle the compressibility.
The loss function is composed of the governing equations of compressible flow
and the boundary conditions, which are free surface and solid boundary
conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately solve the
compressible viscous fluid flow, a problem that was difficult to solve with the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, by applying it to a dam breaking
problem.
