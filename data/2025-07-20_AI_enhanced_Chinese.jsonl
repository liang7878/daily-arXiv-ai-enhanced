However, these parts are prone to internal defects and\ngeometric inaccuracies, stemming in part from variations in the melt pool. This\npaper proposes a novel vector-level feedforward control framework for\nregulating melt pool area in LPBF. By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior\nfrom small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic\nprediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it. This is done\nby operating on two coupled lightweight models: a finite-difference thermal\nmodel that efficiently captures vector-level temperature fields and a\nreduced-order, analytical melt pool model. Each model is calibrated separately\nwith minimal single-track and 2D experiments, and the framework is validated on\na complex 3D geometry in both Inconel 718 and 316L stainless steel. Results\nshowed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric\ninaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode\nvariation by 6.8% on average. Overall, this modular, data-efficient approach\ndemonstrates that proactively compensating for known thermal effects can\nsignificantly improve part quality while remaining computationally efficient\nand readily extensible to other materials and machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eLPBF\u8c03\u8282\u7194\u6c60\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u524d\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u70ed\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7194\u6c60\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "LPBF\u5236\u9020\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u96f6\u4ef6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5185\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6e90\u4e8e\u7194\u6c60\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5411\u91cf\u7ea7\u524d\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u70ed\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u964d\u9636\u5206\u6790\u7194\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u70ed\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7194\u6c60\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u67423D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u9988\u5411\u91cf\u7ea7\u6fc0\u5149\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f7f\u5173\u952e\u5c3a\u5bf8\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e62%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u964d\u4f4e16.5%\uff0c\u5149\u7535\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u53d8\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e6.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8865\u507f\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6750\u6599\u548c\u673a\u5668\u3002"}}

With our paper, we\nprovide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.\nFuture work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better\nhandle variability", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8db3\u7403\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8db3\u7403\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8db3\u7403\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u56e2\u961f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8db3\u7403\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8db3\u7403\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u540c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u8db3\u7403\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent research has explored co-evolutionary approaches, in which\npopulations of generators and discriminators are evolved, as a promising\nsolution. This paper presents an empirical analysis of different coevolutionary\nGAN training strategies, focusing on the impact of selection and replacement\nmechanisms. We compare (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda)\nwith tournament selection coevolutionary schemes, along with a non-evolutionary\npopulation based multi-generator multi-discriminator GAN baseline, across both\nsynthetic low-dimensional datasets (blob and gaussian mixtures) and an\nimage-based benchmark (MNIST). Results show that full generational replacement,\ni.e., (mu,lambda), consistently outperforms in terms of both sample quality and\ndiversity, particularly when combined with larger offspring sizes. In contrast,\nelitist approaches tend to converge prematurely and suffer from reduced\ndiversity.

Evidence suggests that the repeated module\ntends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers\ncapable of handling many roles in the ensemble.

Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and\nschizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing\nneurocomputational theories.

In the field of software engineering (SE), the increasing\ncomplexity of systems and the rising demand for automation have motivated\nresearchers to apply RL to a broad range of tasks, from software design and\ndevelopment to quality assurance and maintenance. Despite growing research in\nRL-for-SE, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic survey of\nthis evolving field. To address this gap, we reviewed 115 peer-reviewed studies\npublished across 22 premier SE venues since the introduction of DRL. We\nconducted a comprehensive analysis of publication trends, categorized SE topics\nand RL algorithms, and examined key factors such as dataset usage, model design\nand optimization, and evaluation practices. Furthermore, we identified open\nchallenges and proposed future research directions to guide and inspire ongoing\nwork in this evolving area.

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing\ntime of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly\nremove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing\nconcerns that may occur in data streams.

We decompose the response into\na posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a\nprincipled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,\nuseful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To\nperform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including\nBayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational\ninference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework\ncan robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy\nobservation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a\nsimulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a\ncontinuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian\nProcess prior.

In this work we\nfocus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers)\ncombine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy\nparameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all\ninteractions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded\n(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different\nways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the\nsaturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.\nWithin this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer\nconcentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers\nare in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low.

Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has\nbeen of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors\npartitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\n  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising. We present a family of\ngraphs where the Markov chain fails to be irreducible when it must keep the\ncomponents perfectly equitable; yet when the chain is allowed an imbalance of\njust one vertex between components, the rejection sampling step may take\nexponential time.

This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational\ncosts due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative\npower of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over\nthe projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization\nproblem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with\nmore intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a\nremedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast\nsampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the\nRelation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise\nassociation of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their\nambient law.

The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions.

Accepted to ESA 2025", "summary": "A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by\ntaking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We\nfurther show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone\nproblem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

A\nseminal theorem of Hell and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il asserts that the $H$-Coloring\nproblem is NP-hard whenever $H$ is loopless and non-bipartite. A result of\nJansen and Pieterse implies that for every graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem\nparameterized by the vertex cover number $k$ admits a kernel with\n$O(k^{\\Delta(H)})$ vertices and bit-size bounded by $O(k^{\\Delta(H)} \\cdot \\log\nk)$, where $\\Delta(H)$ denotes the maximum degree in $H$. For the case where\n$H$ is a complete graph on at least three vertices, this kernel size nearly\nmatches conditional lower bounds established by Jansen and Kratsch and by\nJansen and Pieterse.\n  This paper presents new upper and lower bounds on the kernel size of\n$H$-Coloring problems parameterized by the vertex cover number. The upper\nbounds arise from two kernelization algorithms. The first is purely\ncombinatorial, and its size is governed by a structural quantity of the graph\n$H$, called the non-adjacency witness number. As applications, we obtain\nkernels whose size is bounded by a fixed polynomial for natural classes of\ngraphs $H$ with unbounded maximum degree. More strikingly, we show that for\nalmost every graph $H$, the degree of the polynomial that bounds the size of\nour combinatorial kernel grows only logarithmically in $\\Delta(H)$.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios.

In this paper, we focus on two\ntypes of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise\nunder the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with\n$p\\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite\nvariance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the\nin-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively\nstudied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth\noptimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all\nLipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding\nof the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two\ntypes of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability\nconvergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under\nsub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation\nconvergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are\nconducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex\nobjectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that\nthe theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and\nnumber of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the\ncase of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the\nnon-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the\ntheoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to\nthe smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a\nwell-known lower bound for smooth optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f31\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u9999\u8349\u968f\u673a\u6b21\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SsGD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b21Weibull\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u88c1\u526a\u540e\u7684SsGD\u5728p - BCM\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u548c\u671f\u671b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SFOMs\uff09\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5f31\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u9999\u8349SsGD\u5728\u6b21Weibull\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u3001\u88c1\u526a\u540e\u7684SsGD\u5728p - BCM\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5747\u5728\u5f31\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u9999\u8349SsGD\u5728\u6b21Weibull\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u52a3\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u76ee\u6807\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u88c1\u526a\u540e\u7684SGD\u5728p - BCM\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f31\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u6027\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5bf9\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0b\u754c\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9SFOMs\u5728\u5f31\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u6536\u655b\u6027\u6709\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

While Transformer-based\narchitectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence\nlength hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements\nin State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for\nlong-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and\ntransient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise\nissues in time series.

It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no\nrational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce\nauxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal\ndiscounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve\nmathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually\nperceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative\napproach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse\npartitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are\ngrouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a\nrepresentative element of its group before being added. This method allows for\na phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a\nbehavior described as inertial stabilization.

This\nmapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination\nduring behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our\nmethod leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an\ninformative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various\nmulti-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the\ndeep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in\nscenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods\nstruggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth\nreward is also empirically validated.

Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional\nneural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails\nto capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the\ntree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion\ndynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature\nextraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information\npropagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including\nstandard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors\nfor the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This\nhierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically\ndifferentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree\nstructure.

However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying\nlayer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence\nof graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This\nwork revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir\nGraph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a\nvariant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of\nsurface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification.

However, in many papers neural\nnetworks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel\nor similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new\ndata which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training\nknowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This\nmotivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further\npropose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different\nchannel profiles.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this\nranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each\nrelation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply\nacross all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT\nin low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex\npermutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a\nfour-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine\nusing tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u53ef\u6570\u65e0\u9650\u56feG\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u7f6e\u6362\u526f\u672c\u6784\u6210\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u7684PAC\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u4ef7\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u56fe\u9876\u70b9\u7f6e\u6362\u526f\u672c\u6784\u6210\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u9650\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63cf\u8ff0\u96c6\u5408\u8bba\u548c\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "PAC\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u4e14\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u5e73\u51e1\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u526f\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\uff1b\u8bc1\u660ek\u9876\u70b9\u7f6e\u6362\u548c2\u9876\u70b9\u7f6e\u6362\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e0\u9650\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception\noutdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual\ninformation. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first\nmultidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named\n\\textbf{\\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\\textbf{\\underline{S}}cale\nscenarios with multi\\textbf{\\underline{V}}iew and\nmulti\\textbf{\\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k\nimages and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from\nvehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To\neffectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we\nintroduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding\nand design the LVLM named \\textbf{\\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is\nrealized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than\nimplementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).\nExperimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show\nCity-VLM achieves $18.14 \\%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in\nquestion-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and\ngeneralization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6SVM - City\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1LVLM\u6a21\u578bCity - VLM\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5ba4\u5185\u5bb6\u5c45\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6237\u5916\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6237\u5916\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6237\u5916\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u54082D\u548c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6SVM - City\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1LVLM\u6a21\u578bCity - VLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCity - VLM\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u9ad8\u51fa18.14%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation\nspaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that\nexplicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close\nrelationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a\nnovel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on\nsorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as\na special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the\n\\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic\ncomplexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.\nThe resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in\nlinearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation\ndistances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing\ncompactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic\ndescriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element\ndisplacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,\nwhich encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the\ntwo halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which\nsummarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

Current methods rely heavily on 3D point\nclouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results\nin information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone\nto omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.\nBesides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of\ndetails caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense\nreconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency\nwith 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene\ncomponents, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies.

Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and\ncamera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features\nto create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,\nleading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability.

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results.

Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations.

Recent advances in\nvisual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and\ngeneralization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains\nlimited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a\nfeature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its\nsparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a\nsalient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,\nwe complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric\nfeatures, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on\nthe TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while\nrunning efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single\nGPU.

Substantive work has been\ndone on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,\neach shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their\nsatisfaction scores $f(h_i)$.

To address this limitation,\nrein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising\nstrategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation\nsignals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback\nmechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the\nnatural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the\nuser. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback\n(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,\nimplicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed\nmethod adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into\nprobabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in\nthe presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a\nsimulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2\nrobotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding\nobstacles while manipulating target objects.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into\nautonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in\nOOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD\nscenarios and generate user-level decisions such as \"go straight\" or \"turn\nright.\" However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between\nthe VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and\nthe low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we\npropose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.\nThis approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in\nexisting VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving\nscenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making\nunder OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment\nissue.

Second, we ask the\nnatural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show\nhow Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch\ncouplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on\nsynthetic and imaging data.
