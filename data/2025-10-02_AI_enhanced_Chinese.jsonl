Intuitively, allowing more cooperation\nyields equilibria that are more beneficial for the society of agents. However,\nfor many games it is still an open question how much cooperation is actually\nneeded to ensure socially good equilibria. We contribute to this research\nendeavor by analyzing the benefits of cooperation in a network formation game\nthat models the creation of communication networks via the interaction of\nselfish agents. In our game, agents that correspond to nodes of a network can\nbuy incident edges of a given weighted host graph to increase their centrality\nin the formed network. The cost of an edge is proportional to its length, and\nboth endpoints must agree and pay for an edge to be created. This setting is\nknown for having a high price of anarchy.\n  To uncover the impact of cooperation, we investigate the price of anarchy of\nour network formation game with respect to multiple solution concepts that\nallow for varying amounts of cooperation. On the negative side, we show that on\nhost graphs with arbitrary edge weights even the strongest form of cooperation\ncannot improve the price of anarchy. In contrast to this, as our main result,\nwe show that cooperation has a significant positive impact if the given host\ngraph has metric edge weights.

However,\nPK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable\nstructures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for\nautomated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage\nframework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex\nscientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK\nparameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity\nmetric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,\nconverts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct\na standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,\nincluding captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in\nprecision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA\n3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance\nparameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and\n0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with\nAutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's\nhallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled\nopen-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as\nGPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and\nhigh-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical\napplications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public\nhealth decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and\nterminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters.

To address these limitations, we present Lattica, a decentralized\ncross-NAT communication framework designed to support distributed AI systems.\nLattica integrates three core components. First, it employs a robust suite of\nNAT traversal mechanisms to establish a globally addressable peer-to-peer mesh.\nSecond, it provides a decentralized data store based on Conflict-free\nReplicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring verifiable and eventually consistent\nstate replication. Third, it incorporates a content discovery layer that\nleverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) together with an optimized RPC\nprotocol for efficient model synchronization.

Many restricted versions of the problem have\nbeen considered. For example, bipartite graphs can be drawn such that the two\nsets in the bipartition of the vertex set are mapped to two parallel lines, and\nthe edges are drawn as straight-line segments. In this setting, the number of\ncrossings depends only on the ordering of the vertices on the two lines. Two\nnatural variants of the problem have been studied. In the one-sided case, the\norder of the vertices on one of the two lines is given and fixed; in the\ntwo-sided case, no order is given. Both cases are important subproblems in the\nso-called Sugiyama framework for drawing layered graphs with few crossings, and\nboth turned out to be NP-hard. For the one-sided case, Eades and Wormald\n[Algorithmica 1994] introduced the median heuristic and showed that it has an\napproximation ratio of 3.\n  In recent years, researchers have focused on a local version of crossing\nminimization where the aim is not to minimize the total number of crossings but\nthe maximum number of crossings per edge. Kobayashi, Okada, and Wolff [SoCG\n2025] investigated the complexity of local crossing minimization parameterized\nby the natural parameter. They showed that the weighted one-sided problem is\nNP-hard and conjectured that the unweighted one-sided case remains NP-hard. In\nthis work, we confirm their conjecture.

We implement\nFlowMoE as an adaptive and generic framework atop PyTorch. Extensive\nexperiments with 675 typical MoE layers and four real-world MoE models across\ntwo GPU clusters demonstrate that our proposed FlowMoE framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art MoE training frameworks, reducing training time by 13%-57%,\nenergy consumption by 10%-39%, and memory usage by 7%-32%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFlowMoE\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u5ea6\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMoE\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8MoE\u5c42\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7ba1\u9053\u8c03\u5ea6MHA\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cA2A\u901a\u4fe1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5757\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u5168\u89c4\u7ea6\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b\u5728PyTorch\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9675\u4e2a\u5178\u578bMoE\u5c42\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aGPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFlowMoE\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f413%-57%\uff0c\u80fd\u801710%-39%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u75287%-32%\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowMoE\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMoE\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

One way they do this is by enabling\ndevelopers to build an internal representation of the visualized software and\nits architecture. However, as the amount of displayed data in the visualization\nincreases, the visualization itself can become more difficult to comprehend.\nThe ability to display small and large amounts of data in visualizations is\ncalled visual scalability.\n  In this paper, we present two approaches to address the challenge of visual\nscalability in 3D software cities. First, we present an approach to semantic\nzoom, in which the graphical representation of the software landscape changes\nbased on the virtual camera's distance from visual objects. Second, we augment\nthe visualization with a miniature two-dimensional top-view projection called\nmini-map. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source implementation in\nour software visualization tool ExplorViz. ExplorViz is web-based and uses the\n3D city metaphor, focusing on live trace visualization.\n  We evaluated our approaches in two separate user studies. The results\nindicate that semantic zoom and the mini-map are both useful additions. User\nfeedback indicates that semantic zoom and mini-maps are especially useful for\nlarge software landscapes and collaborative software exploration.

Here, we propose a sequential Bayesian Inference\n(BI) framework for the calibration of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN)\nmodel using multimodal experimental data (i.e., the specimen-level\nforce-displacement (F-D) measurements and the spatially resolved digital image\ncorrelation (DIC) strain fields). This calibration approach builds on a\npreviously developed two-step BI framework that first establishes a\nlow-computational-cost emulator for a physics-based simulator (here, a finite\nelement model incorporating the GTN material model) and then uses the\nexperimental data to sample posteriors for the material model parameters using\nthe Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (T-MCMC). A central challenge to the\nsuccessful application of this BI framework to the present problem arises from\nthe high-dimensional representations needed to capture the salient features\nembedded in the F-D curves and the DIC fields.

We provide, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce\ntwo practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to\nphase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long\ncontexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,\nRoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,\ninterpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE\ndimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight\nsearch over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional\nsymmetric variant to preserve logit scale).

However, their combined influence on shaping\nselectivity to looming motion remains unclear. Driven by recent physiological\nadvancements, this paper offers new insights into the roles of these inhibitory\nmechanisms at multiple levels and scales in simulations, refining the specific\nselectivity for responding only to objects approaching the eyes while remaining\nunresponsive to other forms of movement. Within a feed-forward, multi-layer\nneural network framework, global inhibition, lateral inhibition,\nself-inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition are integrated. Global inhibition\nacts as an immediate feedback mechanism, normalising light intensities\ndelivered by ommatidia, particularly addressing low-contrast looming.\nSelf-inhibition, modelled numerically for the first time, suppresses\ntranslational motion. Lateral inhibition is formed by delayed local excitation\nspreading across a larger area. Notably, self-inhibition and lateral inhibition\nare sequential in time and are combined through feed-forward inhibition, which\nindicates the angular size subtended by moving objects. Together, these\ninhibitory processes attenuate motion-induced excitation at multiple levels and\nscales.

However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be\nNP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity\nscore in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they\neither involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively\nutilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region\n(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency\npatterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node\nfeatures and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,\ngraph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and\nthe volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph\nregions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions\nand adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED\nand propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis\nenables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global\nstructural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive\nperformance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\\%\nrelative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity\nlearning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.\nMoreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED\nsimilarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph\nsimilarity.

To achieve these goals, we present\nElasWave, which provides per-step fault tolerance via multi-dimensional\nscheduling across Graph, Dataflow, Frequency, and Random Number Generation.\nElasWave resizes and reshards micro-batch workloads while preserving the global\nbatch size and gradient scale; it performs online pipeline resharding with\nasynchronous parameter migration, interleaving ZeRO partitions so recovery\nreduces to disjoint rank-to-rank transfers. It further uses DVFS to absorb\npipeline bubbles and reshards RNG to keep consistent computations. A dynamic\ncommunicator enables in-place communication group edits, while per-step\nin-memory snapshots support online verification and redistribution. We\nevaluated ElasWave on 96 NPUs and benchmarked against state-of-the-art\nbaselines: throughput improves by $1.35\\times$ over ReCycle and $1.60\\times$\nover TorchFT; communicator recovery completes within one second (up to\n$82\\times/3.6\\times$ faster than full/partial rebuilds); migration MTTR drops\nby as much as $51\\%$; and convergence deviation is reduced by approximately\n$78\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edfElasWave\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u5f39\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u672a\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u53c2\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u9ad8\u53d8\u66f4\u540e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faElasWave\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u56fe\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3001\u9891\u7387\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bcf\u6b65\u5bb9\u9519\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u5fae\u6279\u6b21\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u91cd\u5206\u7247\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DVFS\u5438\u6536\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6c14\u6ce1\uff0c\u91cd\u5206\u7247RNG\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u572896\u4e2aNPUs\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u76f8\u6bd4ReCycle\u63d0\u9ad81.35\u500d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4TorchFT\u63d0\u9ad81.60\u500d\uff1b\u901a\u4fe1\u5668\u6062\u590d\u5728\u4e00\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fbMTTR\u6700\u591a\u4e0b\u964d51%\uff1b\u6536\u655b\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea678%\u3002", "conclusion": "ElasWave\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Benefits of\nbetter code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software\nmaintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite\nimprovements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code\nsearch has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for\ncode queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general\ntext QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a\nprogramming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering\nknowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nretrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code\nsearch results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse\nvs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations\nacross several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We\nfocus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be\nimplemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several\nLLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities\nbetween LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that\ncan be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations,\nwith significant performance implications. We also find differences in\nrepresentation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human\nand AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap\nscalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study\ndemonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst\ncase) human-human agreement under study.

In\nparallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the\nsensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their\ncognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,\ngeneralization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by\nreal-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,\nand GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge\ncomputing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that\ntogether enable large-scale deployment.

However, training and deploying these\nmodels is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a\nquadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring\nefficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these\nlimitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks\n(SNNs) to design transformer models.

To\naddress this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing\ntransformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach\nwith existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)\nreplacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),\n(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its\nequivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate\nlearning algorithms.

However,\nlocal LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool\ncalling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and\naccurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a\nmethodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:\ntool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a\nnovel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated\nLoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using\nseparate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present\nDualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using\ndecoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of\nlocal models on end-user devices.

As we often only have access to the output of\nalgorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to\nexamine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as\nrace) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual\nfairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains\na challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual\nmeasure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the\ncombination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge.

Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies\nin existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime\noverhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,\nthey miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA\nadapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to\nmissed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication\noverlap, and improved GPU load balance.\n  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA\nfine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting\nmethod that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary\nmemory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without\nincurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling\nlevel, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job\nfine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger\nbatch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each\ngroup to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches.

While numerous tools exist for\ndetecting unused dependencies in Python, removing these dependencies across the\nsource code and configuration files of a project requires manual effort and\nexpertise.\n  To tackle this challenge we introduce PYTRIM, an end-to-end system to\nautomate this process. PYTRIM eliminates unused imports and package\ndeclarations across a variety of file types, including Python source and\nconfiguration files such as requirements.txt and setup.py. PYTRIM's modular\ndesign makes it agnostic to the source of dependency bloat information,\nenabling integration with any detection tool. Beyond its contribution when it\ncomes to automation, PYTRIM also incorporates a novel dynamic analysis\ncomponent that improves dependency detection recall.\n  Our evaluation of PYTRIM's end-to-end effectiveness on a ground-truth dataset\nof 37 merged pull requests from prior work, shows that PYTRIM achieves 98.3%\naccuracy in replicating human-made changes. To show its practical impact, we\nrun PYTRIM on 971 open-source packages, identifying and trimming bloated\ndependencies in 39 of them.

Existing anomaly detection methods focus\nmainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial\ndependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection\nmethods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods\ncan capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised\nand do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these\nmethods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any\nstatistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised\ntensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse\nand spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem\nis formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition\nwhere the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial\nand temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.\nOnce the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly\nscoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies.

LPT offers\ntime-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but\nexperimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further\ncomplicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both\nEulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To\naddress this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian\nflow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous\ninference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing\nequations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish\nempirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative\nregimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow\nstates and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate\nsimultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the\nfeasibility of implicit particle characterization.

However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive\ncapabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding\nbox, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their\nhuman-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual\ninteractions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of\nuser intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn\nentity-level information within images to complement their global\nrepresentations for conventional embedding tasks.

Despite these advances, achieving\ninterpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,\nwe propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a\ndeterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically\ninterpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with\nthe provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the\nlatent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional\ninput functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening\nthrough an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original\ninputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess\nDIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality\nreduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator\nand standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the\nlatent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity\nPDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further\ninvestigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady\nadvection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their\ninfluence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems\nconsidered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric\nstenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery.

Our\ndiagnostic analysis reveals three fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art\nAVR approaches: (1) limited cross-repository generalization, with performance\ndrops on unseen codebases; (2) inability to capture long-range dependencies,\ncausing a performance degradation on complex, multi-hunk repairs; and (3)\nover-reliance on superficial lexical patterns, leading to significant\nperformance drops on vulnerabilities with minor syntactic variations like\nvariable renaming.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SeCuRepair, a semantics-aligned,\ncurriculum-driven, and reasoning-enhanced framework for vulnerability repair.\nAt its core, SeCuRepair adopts a reason-then-edit paradigm, requiring the model\nto articulate why and how a vulnerability should be fixed before generating the\npatch. This explicit reasoning enforces a genuine understanding of repair logic\nrather than superficial memorization of lexical patterns. SeCuRepair also moves\nbeyond traditional supervised fine-tuning and employs semantics-aware\nreinforcement learning, rewarding patches for their syntactic and semantic\nalignment with the oracle patch rather than mere token overlap. Complementing\nthis, a difficulty-aware curriculum progressively trains the model, starting\nwith simple fixes and advancing to complex, multi-hunk coordinated edits.\n  We evaluate SeCuRepair on strict, repository-level splits of BigVul and newly\ncrafted PrimeVul_AVR datasets.

We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on\ntwo decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a\ndifferent conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from\nfrozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT\nmodels cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.\nIntroducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields\nstrong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming\nin-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can\ngeneralize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision\nprovides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more\ndifficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and\narithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that\nincrease combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT\nachieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both\ninstruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL\nbaselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.\nThese findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL\nand support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated\ndemonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

We developed HARPA to address these challenges by\nincorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers.

Diffusion models have recently\ndemonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but\ntheir large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.\nThis paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel\nmethod for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon\nCollaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers\nknowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student\nmodel, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size\nacross distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is\nfurther introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and\nground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust\nperformance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the\nnuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art\nprediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the\nbaseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while\nrequiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x\ncompression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further\nshow that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent\nbehaviors and complex social interactions.

Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we\ndevelop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three\ndimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity.\nOur findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related\nanomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic\ndefects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes.\nCritically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that\nfundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent\ndisconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify\nconcerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts.\nBased on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations\nfor developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that\nmulti-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of\ndistributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences,\nnecessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality\nassurance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u7528\u6237XR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u67902649\u4efd\u771f\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e38\u89c1\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7528\u6237XR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81ea\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8bba\u575b\u3001GitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41XR\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u5e94\u7528\u8bc4\u8bba\u76842649\u4efd\u771f\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u653e\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u540c\u6b65\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5934\u50cf\u76f8\u5173\u5f02\u5e38\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc/\u540c\u6b65\u903b\u8f91\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7ba1\u7406\u6f0f\u6d1e\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u8d8534%\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7528\u6237XR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5b9e\u65f63D\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4f53\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

One reason for this is the \"prior hole\" problem. A prior\nhole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low\nprobability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be\nflexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate\nsamples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper\nproposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are\nknown to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the\nELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency\non MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the\nnormalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.\nThe variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show\nthat such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating\noptimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit\nvariational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling.

Thanks to their\nbidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the\nconnection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the\nfamous \"reversal curse\" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,\nthis bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently\ncompatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not\ncompetitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their\ninherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding\nalgorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible\nperformance degradation.

In particular,\nwe introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to\ngenerate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions\neventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and\namplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the\nmodel itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility\nregularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple\nbenchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with\nminimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human\nevaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated\nreasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.\nLeft unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers\nand undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future\nresearch into this alarming risk.

Building on this\ninsight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient\ntraining of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.\nWe validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and\nself-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our\ninitialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer\nhierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate\nskip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip\nconnections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new\navenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684Transformer\u5757\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684Transformer\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728ViT\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u867d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u4f46\u7834\u574f\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684Transformer\u5757\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684ViT\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684ViT\u514b\u670d\u4f18\u5316\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u542b\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3ViT\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

These\napproaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)\nestimation $\\frac{\\rho_E}{\\rho_{\\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the\nrelative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;\nand Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward\nsignal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on\nimproving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing\ntraining dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA\nfunctions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,\nrelying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a\ndifferent approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,\ni.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To\nthis end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently\nexplores the space of RA functions, yielding \\emph{Discovered Adversarial\nImitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,\nDAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,\noutperforming the current state-of-the-art of \\emph{human-designed} baselines.\nFinally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel\ninsights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL.

We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in\nmechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust\nexplanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the\nConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We\nprovide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model\narchitectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations\nachieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,\nand confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of\nAD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with\nocclusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without\nthe need for domain knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faActivation - Deactivation (AD)\u8303\u5f0f\u53caConvAD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u906e\u6321\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u906e\u6321\u8f93\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u9009\u62e9\u906e\u6321\u503c\u9700\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AD\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u53bb\u9664\u906e\u6321\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51faConvAD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684CNN\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793aAD\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534762.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "ConvAD\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u7f51\u7edc\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches\naddress this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and\nhinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding\nspace. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them\npromising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale\ndifferences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature\ncounts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted\nsubtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.\nAdditionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for\nmatched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel\nGNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative\npositions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between\nadjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs\nmaintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in\nfeature counts.

By preserving both positive and negative\nactivations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.\nComprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks\nshow that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,\nand enables single features to encode contrasting concepts.

This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel\nconflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on\nYouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors\ninvolved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital\nconversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was\nadopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and\nmachine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments\ninto ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media\ncontext and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual\nannotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of\nstatistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions.\nThe findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and\nanti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and\nanti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in\nglobal media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the\nconflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks.\nLikewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying\ncertain discourses while limiting others.

Existing methods target simple visual\ndisturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in\nactions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate\nthe robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four\nmodalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing\nvisual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0\ndemonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build\nmulti-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA\ninputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust\noptimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow\nmatching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,\nand outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions\nacross input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple\nperturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and\napply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most\nharmful noise.

However,\ndifferences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male\ndominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in\nmost roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce\ngender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt\nformulation.

However, a\nmodel that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly\nfor another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and\nevaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study\nemploys a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development\ninterventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are\nstill emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the\nexponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for\nimproving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The\npaper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)\nalgorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector\nMachine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic\nRegression.

In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to\ndefine auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and\nunsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods\nare typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or\non-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning\nenables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across\nmultiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we\nintroduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations\ninto unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a\npolicy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies\ndirectly in latent space.

Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of\nTD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that\ncapture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the\npredictor recovers their successor features in latent space.

This paradigm has shown promise in addressing\nprivacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning\neffects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight\nquantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.\nPrior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives\nby explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take\na different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent\nof unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We\nshow that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it\nexploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order\n(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the\nresilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,\nsuch as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,\ngradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While\nthese optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage\nconvergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby\nresisting post-training perturbations.

Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that\ncombines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy\nwhile enhancing robustness.

LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent\nimprovements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction\nparadigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model\nconditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical\nevaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place\nfeedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback\nwhile using $79.1\\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled\nenvironments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core\nlimitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback\nprecisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and\nsometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content.

We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based\non feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer\noutputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior\nworks, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing\nthe overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with\nall types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further\nimprove compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques\nfor Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a\nper-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a\nsingle model yields better compression results than using a single method\nuniformly across all layers.

Unlike\nconventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize\noptimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and\nreward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes\nthem especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial\noptimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to\noverexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,\nparticularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,\nimproving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing\ndiversity remains a key challenge under this premise.

The recent\nintegration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction\naccuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms.

In this study, we confront this\nchallenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social\nrecommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend\nrecommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item\ninteractions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social\nsignals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction\napproach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a\ncollection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and\ncandidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the\nsummarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate\nitems through intricate substructure analysis.

Building\non prior work, theme-level survey statistics Ease of Use and Learnability,\nSystem Efficiency and Learning Burden, and Perceived Complexity and Integration\nfrom a representative dataset are used to generate 10,000 synthetic scores per\ntheme on the [1,5] Likert scale. The simulated outputs are evaluated against\nthe axioms of dense linear order without endpoints (DLO): irreflexivity,\ntransitivity, total comparability (connectedness), no endpoints (no greatest\nand no least; A4-A5), and density (A6). At the data level, the basic ordering\naxioms (A1-A3) are satisfied, whereas no-endpoints (A4-A5) and density (A6)\nfail as expected. Likert clipping introduces minimum and maximum observed\nvalues, and a finite, discretized sample need not contain a value strictly\nbetween any two distinct scores. These patterns are read not as methodological\ndefects but as markers of an epistemological boundary. Following Kant and\nFriedman, the findings suggest that what simulations capture finite, quantized\nobservations cannot instantiate the ideal properties of an unbounded, dense\ncontinuum.

However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved\nperformance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a\ndescriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with\ntarget-year marginals.

As a result, AI model\nstealing attacks pose a serious concern for AI model providers. In this work,\nwe present a novel attack targeting wireless devices equipped with AI hardware\naccelerators. The attack unfolds in two phases. In the first phase, the\nvictim's device is compromised with a hardware Trojan (HT) designed to covertly\nleak model weights through a hidden communication channel, without the victim\nrealizing it. In the second phase, the adversary uses a nearby wireless device\nto intercept the victim's transmission frames during normal operation and\nincrementally reconstruct the complete weight matrix. The proposed attack is\nagnostic to both the AI model architecture and the hardware accelerator used.\nWe validate our approach through a hardware-based demonstration involving four\ndiverse AI models of varying types and sizes. We detail the design of the HT\nand the covert channel, highlighting their stealthy nature.

To reduce vulnerability to\nverifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\\{0,1\\}$ during\ntraining. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \\textit{false negatives}\n(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \\textit{false positives} (accepting\nincorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct\nfraction $\\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large\nlanguage model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single\nadversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We\nformalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic\nreward channel with asymmetric noise rates.

The first is a \\textit{backward}\ncorrection that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an\n\\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient.

While consistency models\nhave achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their\napplications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved\ngeometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),\nwhich, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while\nrespecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian\ngeometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based\nparameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and\ncontinuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical\nequivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency\ndistillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal\nvector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the\nconditional vector field for training.

When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning\nmethod, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even\ncontinuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for\nhandling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch\nis the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics\nto enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the\noverestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered\nthe architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This\nstudy proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic\nreinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,\nincluding selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration\nwith respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics\nusing a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill\nfactor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded\nestimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a\nwell-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic\nbased reinforcement learning methods.

Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world\nenvironments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a\nhead agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge).

This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,\ntoken/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage\ntheir metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,\ne.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we\nview the model as an improvement operator on its own \"thoughts\" with a\ncontinuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family\nParallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate\ndiverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual\nworkspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output\nthat seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is\ncontrollable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the\ntotal number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current\nmodels that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.\nSetting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential\nRefinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides\nperformance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises\nthe question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this\nend, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it\nconsistent with PDR as the inference method.

Since post-training LLMs via\nRL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first\nconduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal\ntraining batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality\nand (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate\ndifficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which\nidentifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an\non-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on\nthe current policy.

When\nno ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data\ntaken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus\ninferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal\ngeneralisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow\nmatching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal\ntrajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a\nGAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves\nbetween source and target points such that the marginal distributions at\nintermediate time points are close to the observed distributions.

Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a\nclosed-loop \"base+delta\" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare\nexplicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA),\nDead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear\nPareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a\nmodest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from\n0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%.

Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis\nallowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct\nand incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a\none-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to\ncorrect-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to\ngains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.\nImportantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of\nunsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To\nvalidate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed\nconditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to\nample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct\ntokens.

Previous GAD\nmethods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the\nvaluable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical\napproach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages\nboth normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection\nacross diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning\n(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and\nAnomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from\nnormal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly\nrepresentations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images\nthrough residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach\neffectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and\nefficient cross-domain anomaly detection.

While recent studies have explored\nautomatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text\nor image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in\nweb environments.

By coupling the parametric\nframework with geospatial machine learning, the model can be leveraged to\nprovide consistent, high resolution VS-depth predictions of the near-surface\ngeotechnical layer across the U.S., complementing the National Crustal Model\nand supporting applications such as physics-based ground motion simulations and\ncoseismic hazard assessments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f8e\u56fd\u672c\u571f\u526a\u5207\u6ce2\u901f\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u5ca9\u571f\u5c42\u9762\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6ce2\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u571f\u58e4\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u9707\u52a8\u53ca\u7834\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u9707\u707e\u5bb3\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u521a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u533a\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u7b80\u5316\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u571f\u58e4\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f8e\u56fd\u672c\u571f\u526a\u5207\u6ce2\u901f\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u8d859000\u4e2a\u539f\u4f4d\u5ca9\u571f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u5ca9\u571f\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6ce2\u901f - \u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8865\u5145\u56fd\u5bb6\u5730\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5730\u9707\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u540c\u9707\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Consistency Models (CMs), which are\ntrained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential\nequation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion\nsampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch\nsizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the\ntraining dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM\noutput update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move\nparallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate\noscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold\nfeature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point\ntoward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent\n(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform\nthe learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we\nfind that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without\ncompromising sample quality.

Evaluation in simulation shows that\nSTA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling\napproaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x\nimprovement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCross - State Transition Attention Transformer\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6267\u884c\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u672a\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCross - State Transition Attention Transformer\uff0c\u91c7\u7528State Transition Attention (STA)\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cSTA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cTCN\u3001LSTM\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u8d852\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6839\u636e\u6267\u884c\u5386\u53f2\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a\nrobust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of\nboth multi and single-objective scoring.

However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:\nmaintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic\nvariations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield\nmisaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness\nin reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel\nevaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground\ntruth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs\nfrom prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By\ndirectly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies\nthat signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing\nrobustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing\nevaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic\nevaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,\nground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises\nthese alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional\nmisalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging\nand refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I\nmodels and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical\nconstructs.

This\nraises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,\nmight they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose\nmultimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the\npotential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically\nlack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we\nstrive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred\ninto Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a\ngenerative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting\nlatents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of\nmodels, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that\ngenerative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding\nthat show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing\nvariant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method\nsignificantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image\nmodels to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of\nvisual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and\nproprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance.

However, such\napproaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of\nparallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like\nMamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state\ntransitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while\nmaintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,\nMamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its\ncausal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we\npropose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for\nspatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient\ntemporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an\nalignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame\nwithin the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back\nafterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective\nredistribution of aggregated information across all frames.

Optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering\nhigh-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the\nconventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D\nreports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,\nwe propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention\nmechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the\nextraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as\nwell as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We\nintroduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize\ncross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task\nfine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps\n(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,\ninterpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D\n(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed\nCross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two\naxes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification\nby capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating\ninformation from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on\ntwo large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and\nconvolutional models across all key metrics.

Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of\nacquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative\nparadigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the\nperformance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we\nestablish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of\ndistributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior\none-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical\nvalidation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside\nreal-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves\nperformance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of\nalternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into\nthe mechanisms underlying the success of GPC.

Code is available at\n  https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalize-sampling", "summary": "Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon\nknown as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to\nalgorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level\ndriver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically\nfavor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive\npsychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference\ndatasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.\nMotivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,\ntraining-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the\nmodel to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,\n``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').\nComprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance\nacross creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,\nopen-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual\naccuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity\nby 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that\nmore capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new\ndata-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy\nthat helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Verbalized Sampling\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u5178\u578b\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVerbalized Sampling\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Verbalized Sampling\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6a21\u62df\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u76ca\u66f4\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u91ca\u653e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Intuitively, such\nrequirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable\nenvironment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,\ncode). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for\ngenerating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework\ncomprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture\ncontent into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual\nassets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable\nPython codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;\nand (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual\nanchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,\ndiscipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse\ndimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and\nparticularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a\nVLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,\ninterpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct\ncode generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.
