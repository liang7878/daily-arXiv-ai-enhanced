### [1] [Everyone Contributes! Incentivizing Strategic Cooperation in Multi-LLM Systems via Sequential Public Goods Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02076)
*Yunhao Liang,Yuan Qu,Jingyuan Yang,Shaochong Lin,Zuo-Jun Max Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MAC - SPGG框架激励多LLM合作，减少计算成本，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多LLM协作时计算成本与集体性能之间的权衡问题。

Method: 引入基于博弈论的强化学习框架MAC - SPGG，重新设计公共物品奖励，采用顺序协议。

Result: 证明SPNE存在且唯一，MAC - SPGG训练的集合在多项任务中优于单代理基线、思维链提示等方法。

Conclusion: 结构化、激励对齐的MAC - SPGG合作对可扩展和稳健的多智能体语言生成有强大作用。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

### [2] [Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844)
*Christopher Wissuchek,Patrick Zschech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了代理式人工智能系统的类型学，为分析和评估AI系统提供框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对自主代理式AI系统进行分类和比较的结构化框架。

Method: 采用多阶段方法构建和完善类型学，通过人机混合方法评估并提炼类型。

Result: 构建了定义AI系统认知和环境代理的八维类型学。

Conclusion: 该类型学为评估现有系统和预测代理式AI未来发展提供基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

### [3] [A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文引入‘状态’的正式结构，提出分层状态网格和IMU，扩展跨宇宙理论，构建元形式逻辑框架，为智能定义等提供数学基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为不同系统，包括智能的公理化定义，加强理论基础，解决‘状态’概念缺乏共识和明确形式的问题。

Method: 提出分层状态网格提供统一符号系统；引入IMU避免自引用和逻辑不一致；扩展跨宇宙理论并进行概念划分。

Result: 构建了基于‘定义 = 状态’原则，跨越时间、语言、主体和操作的元形式逻辑框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能定义、形式逻辑和科学理论提供了数学上可靠的基础。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

### [4] [AgentTTS: Large Language Model Agent for Test-time Compute-optimal Scaling Strategy in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00890)
*Fali Wang,Hui Liu,Zhenwei Dai,Jingying Zeng,Zhiwei Zhang,Zongyu Wu,Chen Luo,Zhen Li,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究多阶段复杂任务中测试时计算最优缩放问题，提出AgentTTS框架，实验显示其优于传统和其他基于LLM的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要在单阶段任务中研究TTS，而现实多为多阶段复杂任务，需要解决多阶段任务中的TTS问题。

Method: 进行广泛试点实验得出经验见解，提出基于LLM - 代理的AgentTTS框架，通过与执行环境的迭代反馈驱动交互自主搜索计算最优分配。

Result: AgentTTS在搜索效率上显著优于传统和其他基于LLM的基线，对不同训练集大小有更好的鲁棒性和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: AgentTTS能有效解决多阶段复杂任务中测试时计算最优缩放问题。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [5] [Polymorphic Combinatorial Frameworks (PCF): Guiding the Design of Mathematically-Grounded, Adaptive AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581)
*David Pearl,Matthew Murphy,James Intriligator*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了多态组合框架（PCF），它结合大语言模型和数学框架，能让智能体动态适应复杂环境。通过模拟实验揭示智能体适应性趋势，支持多领域AI应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为复杂动态环境设计可动态适应的智能体及解决方案空间，解决静态架构无法实时调整的问题。

Method: 基于组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论定义多维SPARK参数空间，用大语言模型参数化复杂空间，对模拟咖啡馆领域进行超125万次蒙特卡罗模拟。

Result: 揭示了智能体在五个复杂度层级的适应性和性能趋势，高复杂度下收益递减，体现可扩展设计阈值。

Conclusion: PCF可生成特定场景的优化智能体配置，支持可扩展、动态、可解释和符合伦理的AI应用，为下一代多态智能体奠定基础。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

### [6] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 共生AI带来伦理风险，本文提出模糊框架ff4ERA量化伦理风险，案例证明其有效且可用于伦理决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共生AI加深人机协作，带来伦理风险，现有伦理风险评估受不确定性等因素阻碍，需要灵活、透明且稳健的框架。

Method: 引入ff4ERA，整合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法和确定性因子，通过伦理风险得分量化伦理风险。

Result: 案例研究表明ff4ERA能产生与上下文相关、有伦理意义的风险得分，对相关因素敏感，对无关输入稳健，敏感性分析验证了模型设计。

Conclusion: ff4ERA能进行可解释、可追溯且考虑风险的伦理评估，可用于假设分析，指导设计者校准以提供可靠伦理决策支持。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

### [7] [An analysis of AI Decision under Risk: Prospect theory emerges in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00902)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对大语言模型进行Kahneman和Tversky的前景理论测试，发现模型在风险决策上与人类相似，语境对风险偏好影响大，还以此重新审视LLMs推理与记忆的争论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Kahneman和Tversky的前景理论在大语言模型上进行首次测试。

Method: 对大语言模型进行前景理论测试，分析不同场景下模型的风险决策情况。

Result: 前景理论常能预测模型的风险决策，语境是解释风险偏好差异的关键，军事场景比民用场景有更大框架效应。

Conclusion: 语言模型反映人类启发式和偏见，且这些偏见不均匀，维特根斯坦的“语言游戏”能解释场景激活的偏见，研究成果可用于重新审视LLMs推理和记忆的争论。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

### [8] [Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering Using Semantic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00914)
*Dominic Simon,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于语义分析的知识编辑器CHECK用于多跳问答，评估显示比现有框架平均提高22.8%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需更新过期信息，现有知识编辑方法在多跳问答这类需要组合推理的任务上表现不佳，且存在逻辑推理问题。

Method: 基于编译器和大语言模型推理的类比，在执行推理链回答问题前进行语义分析，对有语义错误的推理链通过逻辑优化和更高温度重新提示模型进行修正。

Result: 在四个数据集上与五个最先进的框架对比，CHECK平均提高了22.8%的多跳问答准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的CHECK知识编辑器在多跳问答任务中有效，能提升推理准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模AI系统快速发展下人机工作分配的变化及最终状态。

Method: 将人机任务重新分配形式化为迭代任务委托映射，利用格理论的不动点工具证明，构建三种动态基准模型，进行模拟分析。

Result: 证明至少存在一个稳定均衡，给出唯一性条件；自动化长期占比公式；模拟显示2025 - 2045年自动化从约10%升至约65%。

Conclusion: 人类可成为工作流指挥者，促进人机协作的政策能使经济趋向福利最大化的不动点。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

*Yiyi Lu,Hoi Ian Au,Junyao Zhang,Jingyu Pan,Yiting Wang,Ang Li,Jianyi Zhang,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍用于EDA自动化的AutoEDA框架，实验表明相比现有方法在自动化准确性、效率和脚本质量上有提升，且开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代EDA工作流需大量手动脚本且工具交互多，限制可扩展性和效率，现有LLM解决方案需昂贵微调且缺乏标准化框架。

Method: 利用Model Context Protocol (MCP)进行并行学习，通过结构化提示工程减少微调，实现智能参数提取和任务分解，提供扩展的CodeBLEU指标评估TCL脚本质量。

Result: 在五个基准测试上实验显示，相比现有方法，自动化准确性、效率和脚本质量有提升。

Conclusion: AutoEDA框架有效，已开源支持可重复性和EDA社区。

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.
AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA
community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI代理在电商中的行为，提出了卖家策略、平台设计和监管等问题。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有单轮NL2GQL方法无法有效处理多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖，且高质量多轮数据集稀缺。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型构建多轮NL2GQL数据集的自动方法，提出三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL翻译效果。

Result: 开发了基于金融市场图数据库的MTGQL数据集并将公开。

Conclusion: 为多轮NL2GQL研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Method: 开发gpuRDF2vec库，利用现代GPU和支持多节点执行来加速RDF2vec流程，基于Pytorch Lightning实现可扩展的word2vec

Result: 在合成图和真实基准测试中，gpuRDF2vec比目前最快的jRDF2vec有显著加速，单节点设置下walk - extraction阶段表现优于其他方案

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec能让从业者和研究人员在实际时间预算内对大规模图训练高质量的知识图谱嵌入

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: 生成式AI输出有重复性、偏差问题，且会神秘转变，2024年造成巨大损失和人员伤亡，需研究解决。

Method: 建立与多自旋热系统的数学映射，研究AI基本注意力头尺度的隐藏倾覆不稳定性，推导倾覆点公式。

Result: 揭示隐藏倾覆不稳定性，得出倾覆点公式，展示多层架构对输出倾覆的放大作用。

Conclusion: 研究成果有助于提高AI透明度、可解释性和性能，为量化用户AI风险和法律责任开辟道路。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Motivation: 探究社会经济指标如家庭财富是否能在卫星图像和网络文本中留下可恢复印记。

Method: 使用非洲社区的DHS数据，将Landsat图像与基于位置/年份的大语言模型生成的文本描述以及AI搜索代理从网络获取的文本配对，通过五条管道构建多模态框架预测家庭财富。

Result: 融合视觉和文本在财富预测上优于仅视觉基线，发现部分表征收敛，大语言模型内部知识更有效，组合代理数据有一定增益。

Conclusion: 开发的多模态框架在家庭财富预测上有优势，不同数据有不同效果，发布了大规模多模态数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Motivation: 大多数基于深度学习的轨迹预测方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，限制其在现实世界的应用，需要解决该问题。

Method: 提出H2C方法，通过两种互补策略选择样本子集来代表已学知识，利用记忆重放损失函数更新以保留知识并学习新数据。

Result: 在INTERACTION数据集上实验表明，H2C平均减少22.71%的灾难性遗忘，且无需手动告知分布变化。

Conclusion: H2C能有效减少深度学习方法的灾难性遗忘，可用于跨场景轨迹预测。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Method: 引入CA - MER基准测试评估模型，提出MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE和AR两个模块。

Result: 实验表明MoSEAR在多个基准测试中，尤其在模态冲突条件下达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MoSEAR框架能有效缓解情绪冲突，在一致样本上也有良好表现，且不会造成音频和视觉模态的权衡问题。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

Conclusion: 深入理解CoT推理失败原因和时机，强调实现真正通用推理仍是挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Conclusion: BIS可靠且适用广，能显著降低代码相关任务大模型基准测试的成本和工作量。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Conclusion: 本研究为故障检测提供理论框架，实现显式风险控制，提升诊断系统可信度，推动领域向不确定性感知输出发展。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Conclusion: SketchAgent简化图表生成过程，在设计、教育和工程等领域有前景，有助于弥合手绘草图和机器可读图表生成的差距。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Motivation: 解决语言模型中模型容量和计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 将MoE、MLA和RoPE结合，采用64个微专家和top - k选择的细粒度专家路由、共享专家隔离和无梯度冲突的负载均衡三种创新方法。

Result: 在不同参数模型上实验，实现68%的KV缓存内存减少和3.2倍推理加速，验证损失降低，生成质量提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展决定资源受限语言模型部署的效率边界。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Motivation: 小型语言模型在资源受限环境有优势，但针对它的成员推理攻击研究较少且攻击效果随模型变小而降低，因此有必要研究。

Method: 提出基于现有先进攻击方法min - k的新攻击方法win - k，并使用三个数据集和八个SLMs，将win - k与五个现有MIAs进行实验对比。

Conclusion: 新提出的win - k攻击方法在小型语言模型的成员推理攻击方面有更好的性能。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

*Xianda Zheng,Zijian Huang,Meng-Fen Chiang,Michael J. Witbrock,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为解决大语言模型在处理多上下文知识冲突时的困惑，提出KCR框架，实验证明该框架能显著提升模型解决长上下文知识冲突的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识冲突在不同来源中普遍存在，大语言模型处理多上下文知识冲突时易被冗长和冲突的上下文困扰，需要提升其解决冲突知识的能力。

Method: 提出知识冲突推理（KCR）框架，从冲突长上下文中提取推理路径，用强化学习鼓励模型遵循正确推理路径学习推理范式。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架显著提高了各种骨干模型在长上下文场景中解决知识冲突的能力，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: KCR框架能有效增强大语言模型解决长上下文知识冲突的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Motivation: 现有基准常忽略繁体中文三模态评估和推理延迟，引入Multi - TW解决此问题。

Method: 引入包含900道选择题的Multi - TW基准，评估多种任意到任意模型和带音频转录的视觉语言模型。

Result: 闭源模型在各模态表现通常优于开源模型，开源模型在音频任务表现不错，端到端任意到任意管道比使用单独音频转录的视觉语言模型有延迟优势。

Conclusion: Multi - TW全面展示模型能力，强调繁体中文微调及高效多模态架构的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

Motivation: 现有自动化方法在生成新颖且有证据支撑的假设方面存在不足，缺乏迭代优化和严格的时间评估。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为规划器不可靠，生成计划常有错误或幻觉动作，现有评估方法有局限。

Method: 将LLMs规划作为NLP任务，提出由NLP评估和三个恢复阶段组成的恢复管道，最终用符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 发现计划生成时无明显推理证据，管道质量和可靠性不及经典规划器，平均仅前2.65个动作可执行，符号生成计划平均长度8.4个动作，管道提升动作质量，成功率从21.9%提升到27.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的管道虽能提升规划效果，但仍不如经典规划器。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛部署，确保其安全成关键问题，现有越狱攻击方法有局限，需新方法。

Method: 提出PUZZLED方法，将有害指令关键词掩码成文字谜题（字搜索、字谜、填字游戏），让模型解谜并生成回复。

Result: 在五个最先进大语言模型上评估，平均攻击成功率88.8%，GPT - 4.1达96.5%，Claude 3.7 Sonnet达92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED是简单而强大的攻击，利用大语言模型推理能力将常见谜题转化为有效越狱策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Motivation: 现有假设封闭世界的方法无法捕捉探索性行为和城市道路网络拓扑约束，需新方法。

Method: 引入以道路节点为中心的框架，采用扇区方向POI聚合编码环境上下文，结合结构图嵌入获得节点表示，用Relation - Aware LNN - Transformer进行序列建模。

Result: 模型在城市规模道路用户轨迹评估中，比六个最先进基线在单跳准确性上最高高17个百分点，在MRR上高10个百分点，抗噪性强。

Conclusion: 所提框架和模型在下一步位置预测中有效且性能优越。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Method: 提出CARGO框架，证明问题的NP难后，给出基于混合整数线性规划的精确解和启发式方法，用真实数据集评估，与MILP解、EDF和NDF策略对比。

Result: 相比EDF和NDF，充电成本分别最多降低39%和22%，完成的配送量相当。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在解决基于电动汽车的配送路线规划问题上有效，能降低充电成本。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Result: WinkTPG能在1秒内为多达1000个智能体生成速度曲线，相比现有MAPF执行方法，解质量提升达51.7%。

Conclusion: WinkTPG算法高效且能显著提升多智能体路径规划解的质量。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

Method: 采用两阶段投资任务，设置模型作为投资者、顾问、多智能体协商和复合压力四种实验条件，进行6500次试验。

Conclusion: 大语言模型偏差表现关键取决于社会和组织背景，对多智能体系统和无监督操作的部署有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Result: GenZ - LTL在对未见LTL规范的零样本泛化上大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GenZ - LTL方法有效，能实现对任意LTL规范的零样本泛化。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex
AI tasks by decomposing them into sub-tasks and solving each sub-task using
ready-to-use well-trained models. However, systematically evaluating methods
under this setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
CABENCH, the first public benchmark comprising 70 realistic composable AI
tasks, along with a curated pool of 700 models across multiple modalities and
domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end
assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出QCBench基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在定量化学中的数学推理能力，对19个模型的评估显示任务复杂度增加时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在化学相关任务中进行严谨的逐步定量推理能力未被充分探索，需填补空白。

Method: 构建包含350个计算化学问题、涵盖7个化学子领域的QCBench基准测试，分为三个层次。

Result: 对19个大语言模型的评估显示，随着任务复杂度增加，性能一致下降。

Conclusion: QCBench可细粒度诊断计算弱点，揭示模型特定局限，为未来改进奠定基础，凸显当前语言流畅性和科学计算准确性之间的差距。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法忽略知识的时间动态，存在时间歧义、时间不敏感检索和语义冗余等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出T - GRAG框架，包含时间知识图谱生成器等五个组件，还引入Time - LongQA数据集。

Result: T - GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于之前的RAG和GraphRAG基线。

Conclusion: 对知识进化进行建模对于鲁棒的长文本问答是必要的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

TL;DR: 自动化医疗报告生成（MRG）受三类不确定性阻碍，提出SURE - Med框架减少不确定性，实验显示其达SOTA水平，提升可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动化医疗报告生成临床部署中存在的视觉、标签分布和上下文三类不确定性问题，提升系统可靠性和临床可信度。

Method: 提出SURE - Med框架，包含Frontal - Aware View Repair Resampling模块减少视觉不确定性，Token Sensitive Learning目标解决标签分布不确定性，Contextual Evidence Filter减少上下文不确定性。

Result: 在MIMIC - CXR和IU - Xray基准测试上，SURE - Med达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SURE - Med全面减少多输入模态的不确定性，为医疗报告生成的可靠性树立新标杆，向可信临床决策支持迈进了坚实一步。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型将分析意图转换为可视化的方法是黑盒，缺乏透明推理过程，用户难以理解设计原理和改进欠佳输出。

Method: 1. 为NL2VIS设计全面的CoT推理过程并开发自动管道为数据集添加推理步骤；2. 引入nvBench - CoT数据集用于模型微调；3. 开发与CoT推理过程紧密集成的交互式视觉界面DeepVIS。

Result: 通过定量基准评估、两个用例和用户研究，证明CoT框架有效提升NL2VIS质量。

Conclusion: CoT框架能有效提升NL2VIS质量，同时为用户提供有价值的推理步骤。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

TL;DR: 传统调度规则和深度学习方法处理DFJSP问题有局限，直接用大语言模型也欠佳。提出ReflecSched框架，通过让LLM分析模拟并生成总结，引导决策模块，实验显示其表现优于多种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调度规则和深度学习方法处理DFJSP问题分别存在刚性和需复杂特征工程的问题，直接应用大语言模型存在长上下文悖论、专家启发式利用不足和短视决策等缺陷。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，让LLM分析多规划周期的启发式驱动模拟，生成“战略经验”总结并集成到最终决策模块的提示中。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于直接的LLM基线，胜率71.35%，相对百分比偏差降低2.755%，超越所有评估的单个启发式方法，能缓解三个已知缺陷，在所有问题案例中与针对每个实例定制的最佳启发式方法表现相当。

Conclusion: ReflecSched框架有效解决了直接应用LLM处理DFJSP问题的不足，在该问题上有良好表现。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Conclusion: 该研究为自动科学发现提供可解释概率推理框架，大幅提升机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Method: 使用名为广义累积的通用全局约束实现建模方法，引入新的时间表过滤算法处理条件时间间隔上定义的任务。

Result: 该方法结合新过滤算法与现有求解器相比有竞争力，能实现生产者 - 消费者调度问题建模，且可有效扩展到大型问题。

Conclusion: 提出的建模方法和过滤算法可行且有效。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效构建过程奖励数据并提升数学推理能力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型在专业领域缺乏精度，本文提出ProKG Dial框架构建特定领域多轮对话数据集，经医学知识图谱验证有效提升对话质量和特定领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在专业领域缺乏精度，现有构建特定领域多轮对话数据集的方法资源消耗大或有质量和覆盖度问题。

Method: 提出ProKG Dial框架，利用知识图谱结构特性，先分区知识图谱，再围绕目标实体生成问答，最后严格过滤。

Result: 在医学知识图谱上验证，自动指标和人工评估显示ProKG Dial显著提升对话质量和领域特定性能。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial框架有效且实用，能提升对话质量和领域特定表现。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: 介绍SNOW系统，可从非结构化电子病历笔记自动生成结构化临床特征，在预测前列腺癌复发上表现良好，展示了自主大语言模型系统大规模复制专家特征工程的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从电子病历非结构化临床笔记提取有意义特征方法存在不足，如人工方法费力，自动方法缺乏可解释性和临床相关性，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 引入基于大语言模型的模块化多智能体系统SNOW，用其处理特征发现、提取等，与人工CFG、临床医生引导的LLM方法和RFG方法对比，评估其在预测前列腺癌复发上的表现。

Result: 人工CFG性能最高（AUC - ROC: 0.771），SNOW无需临床专业知识达到相近性能（0.761），显著优于基线特征和所有RFG方法，临床医生引导的LLM方法也较好（0.732）但需专家输入。

Conclusion: 自主大语言模型系统可大规模复制专家级特征工程，可能改变临床机器学习模型利用非结构化电子病历数据的方式，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Conclusion: AMADEUS框架和CharacterRAG数据集对基于RAG的RPA开发和评估有积极作用。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前工作仅从行为上描述大语言模型对齐失败，对训练时信念根源了解少，需找出不安全完成的根源。

Method: 引入TraceAlign框架，核心是信念冲突指数（BCI）；提出TraceShield、对比信念去冲突损失、溯源感知解码策略三项干预措施。

Result: 在对齐漂移基准测试上减少最多85%的对齐漂移，保留标准任务实用性，拒绝质量提升。

Conclusion: TraceAlign是首个可扩展、可追溯、有依据的工具包，能从源头理解和缓解对齐失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Method: 提出相似案例检索增强的危险识别方法，包括检索库、图像相似度检索和大模型检索增强三个模块，通过提示微调整合外部知识和检索案例上下文。

Result: 在真实建筑数据实验中取得显著改进，如GLM - 4V识别准确率提升至50%，提高了35.49%。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了识别准确性、上下文理解和稳定性，为危险检测提供新的理论和技术支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型代理问题解决过程未充分利用，主流方法忽略轨迹间相互依赖且搜索空间缺乏多样性，导致推理冗余和结果欠佳。

Conclusion: SE - Agent通过智能探索和利用跨轨迹启发实现持续自我进化，逐步提高推理质量。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人操作无法直接根据草图工作，需要精确3D信息和专业工具，研究希望让非专家能用2D草图构建3D结构。

Method: 引入抽象关系图，利用组合扩散模型将图转化为3D姿态，并迭代更新预测隐藏支撑。

Result: 在标志性地标和现代房屋设计草图上评估，StackItUp能稳定生成多层3D结构，在稳定性和视觉相似度上优于所有基线。

Conclusion: StackItUp系统有效，可让非专家通过2D草图构建3D结构。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

Motivation: LLM代理以工具为中心的范式引入新的攻击面，即对手可操纵工具元数据影响代理行为，需研究该新威胁。

Method: 提出Attractive Metadata Attack（AMA），一种黑盒上下文学习框架，通过迭代优化生成有吸引力且语法语义有效的工具元数据。

Result: 在十个现实模拟工具使用场景和多种流行LLM代理上实验，攻击成功率81%-95%，有显著隐私泄漏，对主要任务执行影响可忽略，在提示级防御和结构化工具选择协议下仍有效。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是强大且隐蔽的攻击面，当前需超越提示级防御的执行级安全机制。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Motivation: 标准自注意力机制二次复杂度成瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力机制有静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: 引入可训练的动态掩码稀疏注意力机制DMA，动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码，实现位置感知稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 在困惑度、多查询关联回忆任务、标准基准性能和大海捞针任务上，DMA优于多种注意力机制。

Conclusion: DMA能有效平衡模型效率和长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Conclusion: 情感结构化程序生成在推进游戏交互式叙事方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能奠定理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Conclusion: 该方法桥接了主动推理理论和实际应用，证明了认知先验在人工智能体中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Conclusion: 该方法为手动场景设计提供可扩展替代方案，满足更多空管训练和验证模拟需求，展示大语言模型在安全关键领域复杂规划的潜力。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and
advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment.
Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800
million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key
financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and
reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based
finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that
FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent
benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation
for future research and real-world applications. Code is available at

Motivation: 缓解交通拥堵和维持城市交通流动性，改进现有交通信号控制方法。

Method: 在模拟交通环境中，通过专家指导对强化大语言模型进行自我探索和迭代来开发Traffic - R1。

Result: Traffic - R1具有零样本泛化能力、轻量级架构可实时推理、过程可解释且能多路口通信，超越强基线和训练密集型RL控制器，已服务超55000名司机，缩短平均队列超5%，减半操作员工作量。

Conclusion: Traffic - R1为交通信号控制领域设定了新的技术水平，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Conclusion: 该集成方法为MAC领域未来研究和发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Result: 可对通用和特定领域模型在多种PHM任务上进行多维度评估。

Conclusion: PHM - Bench为LLMs在PHM的大规模评估奠定方法基础，提供从通用到PHM专用模型过渡的关键基准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Conclusion: OptiHive是一个有效的基于大语言模型的框架，能为优化问题生成高质量求解器。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

Motivation: 现有推理模型的思维链存在过度冗余问题，根源是后训练过度依赖结果奖励范式，过程奖励范式数据难构建。

Method: 提出PI框架，通过适时干预（When模块）、合理干预（How模块）和干预后采样（Which模块）动态引导和调节推理路径。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验表明，PI能显著缩短思维链，减少幻觉。

Conclusion: PI框架可将人类解决问题的专业知识和认知科学原理融入大语言模型推理过程，增强可控性和可解释性，得到更简洁可靠的推理。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型预测PMA时缺乏透明度和可解释性，难以用于临床决策支持。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（PEFT）策略，对Qwen2.5 - VL - 7B模型进行指令调优和低秩自适应（LoRA），在4张2D皮质表面投影图上训练，用不同提示进行训练和推理。

Result: 微调后的模型预测误差低，95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周，且能基于发育特征生成可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该方法是围产期神经科学中迈向透明可信AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Method: 提出两阶段因果框架CAMA，学习阶段构建并细化MCG，推理阶段从MCG动态提取子图注入LLM引导推理。

Result: 在真实数据集上CAMA显著提升LLM处理复杂数学问题的性能，结构化引导优于非结构化，引入非对称因果关系比对称关联效果好。

Conclusion: CAMA框架能有效提升大语言模型在复杂数学推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Motivation: 扩散策略存在表示崩溃问题，影响复杂机器人操作中处理细微变化的能力。

Method: 引入分散损失正则化，将每个批次内的隐藏表示视为负对，迫使网络学习相似观察的判别性表示。

Result: 早期层正则化有利于简单任务，后期层正则化显著提升复杂操作任务性能；在RoboMimic基准测试中预训练平均提升22.7%，微调后提升26.1%；真实实验成功率高。

Conclusion: D2PPO方法能有效解决扩散策略表示崩溃问题，在复杂任务中优势明显。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

### [86] [Finance Agent Benchmark: Benchmarking LLMs on Real-world Financial Research Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00828)
*Antoine Bigeard,Langston Nashold,Rayan Krishnan,Shirley Wu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 本文提出金融代理基准来测试大语言模型在金融领域能力，评估发现当前AI能力有局限，需进一步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在金融分析和金融行业的完整能力，解决相关疑问。

Method: 构建包含九种金融任务类别的基准，含537个专家编写问题，实现能让大语言模型使用工具的框架。

Result: 评估显示当前AI能力有显著局限，最佳模型准确率仅46.8%，每次查询平均成本3.79美元。

Conclusion: 在高风险金融场景可靠部署前，AI需进一步发展。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has emerged as a transformative force
in financial analysis and the finance industry, though significant questions
remain about the full capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in this
domain. We present the Finance Agent Benchmark, featuring challenging and
diverse real-world finance research problems that require LLMs to perform
complex analysis using recent SEC filings. We construct the benchmark using a
taxonomy of nine financial task categories, developed in consultation with
experts from banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms. The dataset includes
537 expert-authored questions covering tasks from information retrieval to
complex financial modeling, each validated through a rigorous review process to
ensure accuracy and relevance. Moreover, we implement an agentic harness that
equips LLMs with tools sufficient to produce accurate responses, including
Google Search and EDGAR database access. Overall, the Finance Agent Benchmark
provides a comprehensive testbed for measuring the progress of LLM-driven
finance agents. Our evaluation reveals significant limitations in current AI
capabilities - even the best-performing model (OpenAI o3) achieved only 46.8%
accuracy at an average cost of $3.79 per query. This underscores the need for
further advancements before reliable deployment in high-stakes finance
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI发展，评估其理解物理定律、人类准则和硬约束的能力愈发重要，工程产品设计为此提供新挑战。

Method: 提出Bike - Bench基准，量化多种性能特征，用多个数据集支持，对比评估多种算法。

Result: 实验表明LLMs和表格生成模型在有效性和最优性得分上不如优化及优化增强的生成模型。

Conclusion: Bike - Bench作为首创基准，有望推动生成式AI在约束多目标工程设计问题上的进展。

Abstract: We introduce Bike-Bench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating
generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and
constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its
capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints
grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the
intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI
capabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs
that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives
and constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered
and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics,
structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text
or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation
results, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a
synthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric,
CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to
evaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid
algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular
generative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented
generative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting
significant room for improvement. We hope Bike-Bench, a first-of-its-kind
benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained
multi-objective engineering design problems. Code, data, and other resources
are published at decode.mit.edu/projects/bikebench/.

TL;DR: 介绍开源库EngiBench和配套库EngiOpt用于数据驱动工程设计，展示其多功能性并指出设计问题对标准机器学习方法有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工程设计优化依赖物理模拟，存在安装难、计算成本高和需专业知识等问题，需新解决方案。

Method: 引入EngiBench库和数据集，提供统一API和基准测试；发布兼容的EngiOpt库，二者模块化。

Result: 通过实验比较多工程设计问题的先进技术，展示了库的多功能性。

Conclusion: 工程设计问题因设计流形敏感和受限，对标准机器学习方法有重大挑战。

Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes,
topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given
conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are
difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific
expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first
open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven
engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of
benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more --
that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning
algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a
companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the
EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel
algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage
built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks,
and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments
comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design
problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to
perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for
standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained
design manifolds.

Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum
morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved
electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries.
Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as
the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport
processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop
algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep
convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and
employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous
lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the
latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the
morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This
surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation
framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space
of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the
maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific
surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate
the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties
(specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained
optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or
transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of
the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its
correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of
visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.

Conclusion: 所提出的混合无基线损伤检测与定位框架是有效的，可用于复合材料结构的损伤检测与定位。

Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of
structures such as aerospace equipment and wind power installations. Developing
a simple, highly flexible, and scalable SHM method that does not depend on
baseline models is significant for ensuring the operational integrity of
advanced composite structures. In this regard, a hybrid baseline-free damage
detection and localization framework incorporating an unsupervised
Kolmogorov-Arnold autoencoder (KAE) and modified probabilistic elliptical
imaging algorithm (MRAPID) is proposed for damage detection and localization in
composite structures. Specifically, KAE was used to process the guided wave
signals (GW) without any prior feature extraction process. The KAE continuously
learns and adapts to the baseline model of each structure, learning from the
response characteristics of its undamaged state. Then, the predictions from KAE
are processed, combined with the MRAPID to generate a damage probability map.
The performance of the proposed method for damage detection and localization
was verified using the simulated damage data obtained on wind turbine blades
and the actual damage data obtained on composite flat plates. The results show
that the proposed method can effectively detect and localize damage and can
achieve multiple damage localization. In addition, the method outperforms
classical damage detection algorithms and state-of-the-art baseline-free damage
detection and localization methods in terms of damage localization accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出含局部 - 全局层次的流体注意力块及用于连续流体模拟的Transformer架构，提升复杂流体模拟稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的流体模拟网络的神经方法依赖局部粒子间相互作用，强调全局上下文集成对稳定复杂流体模拟的重要性。

Method: 提出有局部 - 全局层次的流体注意力块（FAB），用连续卷积提取局部特征、自注意力捕获全局依赖；首创用于连续流体模拟的Transformer架构并集成到双管道架构中。

Result: FluidFormer在复杂流体场景中表现出最先进的性能，稳定性更强。

Conclusion: 该方法通过融合基于卷积的局部特征和基于注意力的全局上下文建模，为神经流体模拟建立了新范式。

Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable
alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions.
However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for
learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the
first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where
continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures
global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models
long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer
architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly
integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new
paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local
features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid
scenarios.

### [92] [Comparative Model Fidelity Evaluation to Support Design Decisions for Complex, Novel Systems of Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02456)
*Edward Louis,Gregory Mocko,Evan Taylor*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 本文提出评估模型可信度的方法，助力设计师在设计过程中做决策，还探讨不依赖真实数据的模型验证与信任方法及模型保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统工程界存在信任用于复杂系统决策模型的问题，且开发不依赖真实数据的模型验证和信任方法是关键挑战。

Method: 利用模型中包含的物理现象，开发为特定设计决策选择最合适模型的方法。

Result: 未提及明确结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Systems design processes are increasingly reliant on simulation models to
inform design decisions. A pervasive issue within the systems engineering
community is trusting in the models used to make decisions about complex
systems. This work presents a method of evaluating the trustworthiness of a
model to provide utility to a designer making a decision within a design
process. Trusting the results of a model is especially important in design
processes where the system is complex, novel, or displays emergent phenomena.
Additionally, systems that are in the pre-prototype stages of development often
do not have sources of ground truth for validating the models. Developing
methods of model validation and trust that do not require real-world data is a
key challenge facing systems engineers. Model fidelity in this work refers to
the adherence of a model to real-world physics and is closely tied to model
trust and model validity. Trust and validity directly support a designer's
ability to make decisions using physics-based models. The physics that are
captured in a model and the complexity of the mathematical representation of
the physics contribute to a model's fidelity, and this work leverages the
included physical phenomena to develop a means of selecting the most
appropriate for a given design decision.

TL;DR: 现有数据库运维方法无法有效利用专家经验，本文提出DBAIOps混合数据库运维系统，结合推理大模型和知识图谱实现DBA式诊断，评估显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动数据库运维方法（基于规则和大模型）无法有效利用专家经验，存在局限性。

Method: 引入异构图形模型表示诊断经验，提出半自动图构建算法；开发800+可复用异常模型；提出两阶段图演化机制，利用推理大模型推断根因并生成诊断报告。

Result: 在四个主流数据库系统评估中，DBAIOps在根因和人工评估准确性上分别比现有基线高34.85%和47.22%。

Conclusion: DBAIOps能有效解决现有数据库运维方法的局限，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 文章对高级混合搜索架构进行系统基准测试，揭示关键发现并为设计混合搜索系统提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统中混合搜索架构设计空间大且复杂，缺乏对核心组件权衡的系统实证理解。

Method: 提出框架评估四种检索范式及其组合和重排序策略，在11个真实数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: 发现“最弱环节”现象；得出性能权衡的数据驱动图谱；确定基于张量的重排序融合为高效替代方法。

Conclusion: 为设计下一代自适应、可扩展混合搜索系统提供具体指导，指明未来研究方向。

Abstract: Hybrid search, the integration of lexical and semantic retrieval, has become
a cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems, driven by demanding
applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The architectural
design space for these systems is vast and complex, yet a systematic, empirical
understanding of the trade-offs among their core components--retrieval
paradigms, combination schemes, and re-ranking methods--is critically lacking.
To address this, and informed by our experience building the Infinity
open-source database, we present the first systematic benchmark of advanced
hybrid search architectures. Our framework evaluates four retrieval
paradigms--Full-Text Search (FTS), Sparse Vector Search (SVS), Dense Vector
Search (DVS), and Tensor Search (TenS)--benchmarking their combinations and
re-ranking strategies across 11 real-world datasets. Our results reveal three
key findings for practitioners and researchers: (1) A "weakest link"
phenomenon, where a single underperforming retrieval path can
disproportionately degrade overall accuracy, highlighting the need for
path-wise quality assessment before fusion. (2) A data-driven map of the
performance trade-offs, demonstrating that optimal configurations depend
heavily on resource constraints and data characteristics, moving beyond a
one-size-fits-all approach. (3) The identification of Tensor-based Re-ranking
Fusion (TRF) as a high-efficacy alternative to mainstream fusion methods,
offering the semantic power of tensor search at a fraction of the computational
and memory cost. Our findings offer concrete guidelines for designing the next
generation of adaptive, scalable hybrid search systems while also identifying
key directions for future research.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦三种数据结构，提出部分持久化实现，减少持久内存写开销，部分数据结构有性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据结构冗余数据存入持久内存会增加写开销、降低性能。

Method: 针对双链表、B+树和哈希表，提出部分持久化实现，仅将有限数据字段存入持久内存，崩溃重启后用持久数据字段重建数据结构。

Result: 与基础实现相比，部分数据结构实现5 - 20%的加速，对于刷新主导的数据结构加速可达165%。

Conclusion: 所提出的部分持久化实现能有效减少持久内存写开销，提升数据结构性能。

Abstract: Data structures used in software development have inbuilt redundancy to
improve software reliability and to speed up performance. Examples include a
Doubly Linked List which allows a faster deletion due to the presence of the
previous pointer. With the introduction of Persistent Memory, storing the
redundant data fields into persistent memory adds a significant write overhead,
and reduces performance. In this work, we focus on three data structures -
Doubly Linked List, B+Tree and Hashmap, and showcase alternate partly
persistent implementations where we only store a limited set of data fields to
persistent memory. After a crash/restart, we use the persistent data fields to
recreate the data structures along with the redundant data fields. We compare
our implementation with the base implementation and show that we achieve
speedups around 5-20% for some data structures, and up to 165% for a
flush-dominated data structure.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 云数据库向存储解耦发展，但控制平面仍依赖外部协调服务，存在局限性。提出Marlin解耦集群协调，消除外部服务需求，评估显示其成本效率提升、重配置时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云数据库控制平面依赖外部协调服务，面临可扩展性瓶颈、成本效率低和运维负担大等问题，需解耦集群协调。

Method: 提出云原生协调机制Marlin，将协调功能整合到现有云原生数据库，允许跨节点修改协调状态，用事务管理状态并引入MarlinCommit协议。

Result: 评估表明，与融合协调解决方案相比，Marlin成本效率最高提升4.4倍，重配置时间最多减少4.9倍。

Conclusion: Marlin可有效解耦集群协调，提升成本效率，减少重配置时间。

Abstract: Modern cloud databases are shifting from converged architectures to storage
disaggregation, enabling independent scaling and billing of compute and
storage. However, cloud databases still rely on external, converged
coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper) for their control planes. These
services are effectively lightweight databases optimized for low-volume
metadata. As the control plane scales in the cloud, this approach faces similar
limitations as converged databases did before storage disaggregation:
scalability bottlenecks, low cost efficiency, and increased operational burden.
  We propose to disaggregate the cluster coordination to achieve the same
benefits that storage disaggregation brought to modern cloud DBMSs. We present
Marlin, a cloud-native coordination mechanism that fully embraces storage
disaggregation. Marlin eliminates the need for external coordination services
by consolidating coordination functionality into the existing cloud-native
database it manages. To achieve failover without an external coordination
service, Marlin allows cross-node modifications on coordination states. To
ensure data consistency, Marlin employs transactions to manage both
coordination and application states and introduces MarlinCommit, an optimized
commit protocol that ensures strong transactional guarantees even under
cross-node modifications. Our evaluations demonstrate that Marlin improves cost
efficiency by up to 4.4x and reduces reconfiguration duration by up to 4.9x
compared to converged coordination solutions.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出OnPair及OnPair16字典压缩算法，兼顾高压缩率与快速随机访问，实验显示表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩率和速度上难以兼顾，无法满足内存数据库系统需求。

Method: 采用缓存友好字典构建技术，增量合并频繁相邻子串；OnPair16限制字典条目为16字节，通过优化最长前缀匹配实现快速解析。

Result: 在真实数据集上，OnPair和OnPair16压缩率与BPE相当，压缩速度和内存使用显著改善。

Conclusion: OnPair和OnPair16能有效兼顾高压缩率与快速随机访问，适合内存数据库系统。

Abstract: We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet
the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and
fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios
at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at
the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by
employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally
merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data
sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global
pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a
variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via
optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings
independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level
overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16
achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving
compression speed and memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要推断隐含心理状态的基于心理学的任务上存在局限，原因是缺乏理论对齐的监督和难以捕捉现实叙事中的细微心理过程。

Method: 利用专家标注、富含心理学的场景，提出轨迹感知强化学习框架，该框架明确模仿专家心理思维模式，将现实刺激与结构化推理指导相结合。

Result: 模型实现了专家级的解释能力，在不同、具有挑战性和基于心理学的任务中表现出强大的分布外泛化能力和稳健的持续学习能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能使紧凑型模型内化社会认知原则，进行细微的心理推理，并支持持续自我提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models show promise in emotion understanding, social
reasoning, and empathy, yet they struggle with psychologically grounded tasks
that require inferring implicit mental states in context-rich, ambiguous
settings. These limitations arise from the absence of theory-aligned
supervision and the difficulty of capturing nuanced mental processes in
real-world narratives. To address this gap, we leverage expert-labeled,
psychologically rich scenarios and propose a trajectory-aware reinforcement
learning framework that explicitly imitates expert psychological thought
patterns. By integrating real-world stimuli with structured reasoning guidance,
our approach enables compact models to internalize social-cognitive principles,
perform nuanced psychological inference, and support continual
self-improvement. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks further
demonstrate that our models achieve expert-level interpretive capabilities,
exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization and robust continual
learning across diverse, challenging, and psychologically grounded tasks.

TL;DR: 提出多模型分析系统M2，用集成存储引擎和多阶段哈希连接算法，性能比现有方法提升高达188倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模型数据处理方法如多语言持久化和多模型数据库系统有高通信成本、处理效率低等局限。

Method: 提出M2系统，将所有数据模型视为一等实体，引入多阶段哈希连接算法。

Result: M2在多模型分析中比现有方法速度提升高达188倍。

Conclusion: M2系统及其采用的技术有效。

Abstract: Modern data analytic workloads increasingly require handling multiple data
models simultaneously. Two primary approaches meet this need: polyglot
persistence and multi-model database systems. Polyglot persistence employs a
coordinator program to manage several independent database systems but suffers
from high communication costs due to its physically disaggregated architecture.
Meanwhile, existing multi-model database systems rely on a single storage
engine optimized for a specific data model, resulting in inefficient processing
across diverse data models. To address these limitations, we present M2, a
multi-model analytic system with integrated storage engines. M2 treats all data
models as first-class entities, composing query plans that incorporate
operations across models. To effectively combine data from different models,
the system introduces a specialized inter-model join algorithm called
multi-stage hash join. Our evaluation demonstrates that M2 outperforms existing
approaches by up to 188x speedup on multi-model analytics, confirming the
effectiveness of our proposed techniques.

Abstract: Load balancing is among the basic primitives in distributed computing. In
this paper, we consider this problem when executed locally on a network with
nodes prone to failures. We show that there exist lightweight network
topologies that are immune to message delivery failures incurred by (at most) a
constant fraction of all nodes. More precisely, we design a novel deterministic
fault-tolerant local load balancing (LLB) algorithm, which, similarly to their
classical counterparts working in fault-free networks, has a relatively simple
structure and guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the average value
despite crash and omission failures.
  As the second part of our contribution, we show three applications of the
newly developed fault-tolerant local load balancing protocol. We give a
randomized consensus algorithm, working against $t < n / 3$ crash failures,
that improves over the best-known consensus solution by Hajiaghayi et al. with
respect to communication complexity, yet with an arguable simpler technique of
combining a randomly and locally selected virtual communication graph with a
deterministic fault-tolerant local load balancing on this graph.
  We also give a new solution for consensus for networks with omission
failures. Our solution works against $t < \frac{n}{C\log{n} (\log\log n)^2}$
omissions, for some constant $C$, is nearly optimal in terms of time
complexity, but most notably -- it has communication complexity $O((t^2 +
n)\text{ polylog } {n})$, matching, within a polylogarithmic factor, the lower
bound by Abraham et. al. with respect to both terms depending on $t$ and $n$.
Ours is the first algorithm in the literature that is simultaneously nearly
optimal, in terms of $n,t$, with respect to both complexity measures, against
the adaptive omission-causing adversary.

Motivation: 改进分布式计算LOCAL模型中Δ - 着色问题的确定性复杂度。

Method: 开发从Δ - 着色到最大独立集（MIS）的归约方法。

Result: 确定性复杂度达Õ(log^{5/3} n)轮；随机复杂度在一般图上为Õ(log^{5/3} log n)轮；在有界度图上确定性和随机复杂度分别为Θ(log n)和Θ(log log n)；在常数团数图上给出到(Δ + 1) - 着色问题的归约。

Conclusion: 所开发的归约方法有效提升了Δ - 着色问题在不同场景下的复杂度。

Abstract: Recent improvements on the deterministic complexities of fundamental graph
problems in the LOCAL model of distributed computing have yielded
state-of-the-art upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds for maximal
independent set (MIS) and $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring [Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24]
and $\tilde{O}(\log^{19/9} n)$ rounds for the more restrictive
$\Delta$-coloring problem [Ghaffari, Kuhn, FOCS'21; Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24;
Bourreau, Brandt, Nolin, STOC'25]. In our work, we show that $\Delta$-coloring
can be solved deterministically in $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds as well,
matching the currently best bound for $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring.
  We achieve our result by developing a reduction from $\Delta$-coloring to MIS
that guarantees that the (asymptotic) complexity of $\Delta$-coloring is at
most the complexity of MIS, unless MIS can be solved in sublogarithmic time, in
which case, due to the $\Omega(\log n)$-round $\Delta$-coloring lower bound
from [BFHKLRSU, STOC'16], our reduction implies a tight complexity of
$\Theta(\log n)$ for $\Delta$-coloring. In particular, any improvement on the
complexity of the MIS problem will yield the same improvement for the
complexity of $\Delta$-coloring (up to the true complexity of
$\Delta$-coloring).
  Our reduction yields improvements for $\Delta$-coloring in the randomized
LOCAL model and when complexities are parameterized by both $n$ and $\Delta$.
We obtain a randomized complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} \log n)$
rounds (improving over the state of the art of $\tilde{O}(\log^{8/3} \log n)$
rounds) on general graphs and tight complexities of $\Theta(\log n)$ and
$\Theta(\log \log n)$ for the deterministic, resp.\ randomized, complexity on
bounded-degree graphs. In the special case of graphs of constant clique number
(which for instance include bipartite graphs), we also give a reduction to the
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem.

Abstract: Blockchain technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and is now widely
used in a variety of fields. Blockchain appears to be one of the best solutions
for managing massive heterogeneous devices while achieving advanced data
security and data reputation, particularly in the field of large-scale IoT
(Internet of Things) networks. Despite the numerous advantages, there are still
challenges while deploying IoT applications on blockchain systems due to the
limited storage, power, and computing capability of IoT devices, and some of
these problems are caused by the consensus algorithm, which plays a significant
role in blockchain systems by ensuring overall system reliability and
robustness. Nonetheless, most existing consensus algorithms are prone to poor
node reliability, low transaction per second (TPS) rates, and scalability
issues. Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms,
this paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC)
mechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional
algorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and
manage active nodes. Our experiments show that the EBRC algorithm has lower
consensus delay, higher throughput, improved security, and lower verification
costs. It offers new reference ideas for solving the Internet of
Things+blockchain+Internet court construction problem.

Abstract: In the future 6G and wireless networks, particularly in dense urban
environments, bandwidth exhaustion and limited capacity pose significant
challenges to enhancing data rates. We introduce a novel system model designed
to improve the data rate of users in next-generation multi-cell networks by
integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Assisted Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surfaces (RIS), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and Coordinated
Multipoint Transmission (CoMP). Optimally deploying Aerial RIS for higher data
rates, employing NOMA to improve spectral efficiency, and utilizing CoMP to
mitigate inter-cell interference (ICI), we significantly enhance the overall
system capacity and sum rate. Furthermore, we address the challenge of feedback
overhead associated with Quantized Phase Shifts (QPS) from the receiver to RIS.
The feedback channel is band-limited and cannot support a large overhead of QPS
for uplink communication. To ensure seamless transmission, we propose a Machine
Learning Autoencoder technique for a compressed communication of QPS from the
receiver to RIS, while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we investigate
the impact of the number of Aerial RIS elements and power allocation ratio for
NOMA on the individual data rate of users. Our simulation results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spectral efficiency, outage probability, and
bandwidth utilization, highlighting the potential of the proposed architecture
to enhance network performance.

Motivation: 解决PD聚合和分解哪种方法更适合服务大语言模型的争论，优化不同服务级别目标下的吞吐量。

Method: 提出TaiChi系统，采用统一的分解 - 聚合架构，使用不同能力的GPU实例，通过三个可配置滑块控制实例比例和块大小，利用流动解码调度和长度感知预填充调度进行细粒度延迟转移。

Result: 实验表明TaiChi在平衡的TTFT和TPOT SLO下，比现有系统的吞吐量最高提升77%。

Conclusion: TaiChi系统能够统一PD分解和聚合，在任何TTFT和TPOT SLO组合下实现最优吞吐量。

Abstract: An ongoing debate considers whether prefill-decode (PD) aggregation or
disaggregation is superior for serving large language models (LLMs). This has
driven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.
This paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels
under different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for
tight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),
while disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under
balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.
  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD
disaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of
TTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation
architecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast
prefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,
slow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these
instances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by
adjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD
aggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD
disaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode
for superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency
shifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs
to those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.
This fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling
mechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill
scheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our
experiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art
systems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.

Conclusion: DySTop能有效解决现有异步去中心化联邦学习的问题，提升训练效率和降低通信开销。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a potential distributed learning
paradigm that enables model training on edge devices (i.e., workers) while
preserving data privacy. However, its reliance on a centralized server leads to
limited scalability. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the
dependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange.
Existing DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may
result in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge
environments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have
been proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model
aggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training
performance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these
issues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes
dynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL. In each round,
multiple workers are activated, and a subset of their neighbors is selected to
transmit models for aggregation, followed by local training. We provide a
rigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the
quantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such
as maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among
workers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation
algorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction
algorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID.
Extensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world
testbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by
51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to
state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy.

Result: 该算法可用于分布式和集中式资源分配协议，组件验证显示其资源估计性能直接，具备可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源估计上表现良好，具有可扩展性和可伸缩性。

Abstract: With an ever growing number of heterogeneous applicational services running
on equally heterogeneous computational systems, the problem of resource
management becomes more essential. Although current solutions consider some
network and time requirements, they mostly handle a pre-defined list of
resource types by design and, consequently, fail to provide an extensible
solution to assess any other set of requirements or to switch strategies on its
resource estimation. This work proposes an heuristics-based estimation solution
to support any computational system as a self-assessment, including
considerations on dynamically weighting the requirements, how to compute each
node's capacity towards an admission request, and also offers the possibility
to extend the list of resource types considered for assessment, which is an
uncommon view in related works. This algorithm can be used by distributed and
centralized resource allocation protocols to decide the best node(s) for a
service intended for deployment. This approach was validated across its
components and the results show that its performance is straightforward in
resource estimation while allowing scalability and extensibility.

Conclusion: 提出的 FedAPTA 能有效解决 CPNs 中 FL 多任务部署问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has shown considerable promise in Computing Power
Networks (CPNs) for privacy protection, efficient data utilization, and dynamic
collaboration. Although it offers practical benefits, applying FL in CPNs
continues to encounter a major obstacle, i.e., multi-task deployment. However,
existing work mainly focuses on mitigating FL's computation and communication
overhead of a single task while overlooking the computing resource wastage
issue of heterogeneous devices across multiple tasks in FL under CPNs. To
tackle this, we design FedAPTA, a federated multi-task learning framework in
CPNs. FedAPTA alleviates computing resource wastage through the developed
layer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while
considering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally
heterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous
model recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables
the aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared
global model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We
deploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL
methods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA
considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23%. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Zhenzovo/FedCPN.

Conclusion: 结合交错CPU访问和本地化PIM单元访问可有效解决HTAP数据格式矛盾，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) is an emerging database
paradigm that supports both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online
analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. Computing-intensive OLTP operations,
involving row-wise data manipulation, are suitable for row-store format. In
contrast, memory-intensive OLAP operations, which are column-centric, benefit
from column-store format. This \emph{data-format dilemma} prevents HTAP systems
from concurrently achieving three design goals: performance isolation, data
freshness, and workload-specific optimization. Another background technology is
Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computing units (PIM units) inside
DRAM memory devices to accelerate memory-intensive workloads, including OLAP.
  Our key insight is to combine the interleaved CPU access and localized PIM
unit access to provide two-dimensional access to address the data format
contradictions inherent in HTAP. First, we propose a unified data storage
format with novel data alignment and placement techniques to optimize the
effective bandwidth of CPUs and PIM units and exploit the PIM's parallelism.
Second, we implement the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) essential for
single-instance HTAP. Third, we extend the commercial PIM architecture to
support the OLAP operations and concurrent access from PIM and CPU. Experiments
show that PUSHtap can achieve 3.4\texttimes{}/4.4\texttimes{} OLAP/OLTP
throughput improvement compared to multi-instance PIM-based design.

Conclusion: TeraNoC能有效解决传统互连瓶颈，实现可扩展性、低延迟和低路由开销。

Abstract: A key challenge in on-chip interconnect design is to scale up bandwidth while
maintaining low latency and high area efficiency. 2D-meshes scale with low
wiring area and congestion overhead; however, their end-to-end latency
increases with the number of hops, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive
core-to-L1-memory access. On the other hand, crossbars offer low latency, but
their routing complexity grows quadratically with the number of I/Os, requiring
large physical routing resources and limiting area-efficient scalability. This
two-sided interconnect bottleneck hinders the scale-up of many-core,
low-latency, tightly coupled shared-memory clusters, pushing designers toward
instantiating many smaller and loosely coupled clusters, at the cost of
hardware and software overheads. We present TeraNoC, an open-source, hybrid
mesh-crossbar on-chip interconnect that offers both scalability and low
latency, while maintaining very low routing overhead. The topology, built on
32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the
area-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is
designed to balance traffic load across interconnect channels. Using TeraNoC,
we build a cluster with 1024 single-stage, single-issue cores that share a
4096-banked L1 memory, implemented in 12nm technology. The low interconnect
stalls enable high compute utilization of up to 0.85 IPC in compute-intensive,
data-parallel key GenAI kernels. TeraNoC only consumes 7.6\% of the total
cluster power in kernels dominated by crossbar accesses, and 22.7\% in kernels
with high 2D-mesh traffic. Compared to a hierarchical crossbar-only cluster,
TeraNoC reduces die area by 37.8\% and improves area efficiency (GFLOP/s/mm2)
by up to 98.7\%, while occupying only 10.9\% of the logic area.

Abstract: The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in
large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in
recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is
scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s
high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware
brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling,
efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure.
This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for
SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated
architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention,
feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed
fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and
disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent
scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this
architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages
CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and
all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with
system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

systems that enables secure, precise, and tamper-proof verification of data
without relying on central authorities. Existing consensus protocols,
nevertheless, suffer from drawbacks, some of which are related to scalability,
resource consumption, and fault tolerance. We introduce Blockchain Epidemic
Consensus Protocol (BECP), a novel fully decentralised consensus protocol for
blockchain networks at a large scale. BECP follows epidemic communication
principles, without fixed roles like validators or leaders, and achieves
probabilistic convergence, efficient message dissemination, and tolerance to
message delays. We provide an extensive experimental comparison of BECP against
classic protocols like PAXOS, RAFT, and PBFT, and newer epidemic-based
protocols like Avalanche and Snowman. The findings indicate that BECP provides
desirable gains in throughput, consensus latency, and substantial
message-passing efficiency compared to existing epidemic-based approaches,
validating its usability as an effective and scalable approach for
next-generation blockchain systems.

Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger technology that has been
widely adopted in many sectors for various applications such as
cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and supply chain management. Distributed
consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure
trust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions
processed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed,
each affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource
consumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised
consensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for
very large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach
leverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed
set of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence,
efficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures.
A comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional
protocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
(PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which
is specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate
how BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus
latency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of
consensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.
Furthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to
Avalanche. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fully
decentralised consensus for blockchain technology based on epidemic protocols.

TL;DR: 文章探讨将学习预测集成到LSM树查找路径的两种方法，实验显示可降低查询延迟和内存使用，展示了学习索引组件潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代键值存储基于LSM树写优化带来读放大问题，辅助结构有内存成本，学习数据结构有优化潜力。

Method: 一是用分类器选择性绕过无关层级的布隆过滤器探测；二是用紧凑学习模型和小备份过滤器替代传统布隆过滤器。并在Monkey风格LSM树上实现。

Result: 分类器可将GET延迟最多降低2.28倍，跳过30%布隆过滤器检查；学习布隆过滤器设计实现零误报，削减70 - 80%每层级内存使用。

Conclusion: 两种设计体现了延迟、内存和正确性之间的权衡，凸显学习索引组件在写优化存储系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for
write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.
Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that
scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data
structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these
components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this
work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the
LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom
filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query
latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned
models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without
compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style
LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic
workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up
to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,
though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design
achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory
usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary
trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the
potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效解决 DAR 及相关问题，在实际应用中具良好可扩展性。

Abstract: We study the problem of Direct-Access Ranked Retrieval (DAR) for interactive
data tooling, where evolving data exploration practices, combined with
large-scale and high-dimensional datasets, create new challenges. DAR concerns
the problem of enabling efficient access to arbitrary rank positions according
to a ranking function, without enumerating all preceding tuples. To address
this need, we formalize the DAR problem and propose a theoretically efficient
algorithm based on geometric arrangements, achieving logarithmic query time.
However, this method suffers from exponential space complexity in high
dimensions. Therefore, we develop a second class of algorithms based on
$\varepsilon$-sampling, which consume a linear space. Since exactly locating
the tuple at a specific rank is challenging due to its connection to the range
counting problem, we introduce a relaxed variant called Conformal Set Ranked
Retrieval (CSR), which returns a small subset guaranteed to contain the target
tuple. To solve the CSR problem efficiently, we define an intermediate problem,
Stripe Range Retrieval (SRR), and design a hierarchical sampling data structure
tailored for narrow-range queries. Our method achieves practical scalability in
both data size and dimensionality. We prove near-optimal bounds on the
efficiency of our algorithms and validate their performance through extensive
experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating scalability to
millions of tuples and hundreds of dimensions.

Motivation: 之前关于节点PageRank中心性局部估计复杂度的上下界存在差距，尤其是考虑入度时，在入度较小时差距大，需要缩小该差距。

Method: 提出新算法，假设提前知道节点数、入度和出度的界，采用基于蒙特卡罗估计PageRank分数的随机反向传播过程。

Result: 新算法达到了之前的下界（至对数因子）。

Conclusion: 新算法有效缩小了节点PageRank中心性局部估计复杂度上下界的差距。

Abstract: We study the computational complexity of locally estimating a node's PageRank
centrality in a directed graph $G$. For any node $t$, its PageRank centrality
$\pi(t)$ is defined as the probability that a random walk in $G$, starting from
a uniformly chosen node, terminates at $t$, where each step terminates with a
constant probability $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
  To obtain a multiplicative $\big(1\pm O(1)\big)$-approximation of $\pi(t)$
with probability $\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is
$O(n^{1/2}\min\{ \Delta_{in}^{1/2},\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}\})$ from [Wang,
Wei, Wen, Yang STOC '24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and
edges in $G$, and $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees
and out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the
previously best lower bound of
$\Omega(n^{1/2}\min\{\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},m^{1/4}\})$,
where $\gamma=\frac{\log(1/(1-\alpha))}{4\log\Delta_{in}-2\log(1/(1-\alpha))}$
if $\Delta_{in}>1/(1-\alpha)$, and $\gamma=1/2$ if
$\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$. As $\gamma$ only depends on $\Delta_{in}$, the
known upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$,
and $\Delta_{out}$. However, there remains a gap of $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ when
considering $\Delta_{in}$, and this gap is large when $\Delta_{in}$ is small.
In the extreme case where $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$, we have $\gamma=1/2$,
leading to a gap of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ between the bounds $O(n^{1/2})$ and
$\Omega(1)$.
  In this paper, we present a new algorithm that achieves the above lower bound
(up to logarithmic factors). The algorithm assumes that $n$ and the bounds
$\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ are known in advance. Our key technique is a
novel randomized backwards propagation process which only propagates
selectively based on Monte Carlo estimated PageRank scores.

Motivation: 现有的快速矩阵乘法算法很多只能用于极大矩阵，在实际中无法使用，需要寻找更实用的快速算法。

Method: 使用三线性聚合方法，利用 de Groote 等价替换部分算法，通过寻找稀疏分解和降低首项系数改进加法复杂度。

Result: 得到复杂度为 $O(n^{2.773203})$ 的算法，在小基准情形下是最快的，在许多小基准情形和大基准情形下都有更好的渐近复杂度。

Conclusion: 这是在实际中超越现有快速矩阵乘法算法的重要一步。

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental kernel in high performance computing.
Many algorithms for fast matrix multiplication can only be applied to enormous
matrices ($n>10^{100}$) and thus cannot be used in practice. Of all algorithms
applicable to feasible input, Pan's $O(n^{2.773372})$ algorithm (1982) is
asymptotically the fastest. We obtain an $O(n^{2.773203})$ algorithm applicable
to the same input sizes as Pan's algorithm. This algorithm is the fastest
matrix multiplication algorithm with base case smaller than $1000$. Further,
our method obtains the best asymptotic complexity for many small base cases,
starting at $n_0=28$. We also obtain better exponents for larger base cases. To
construct our algorithm, we use the trilinear aggregation method. We find parts
of the algorithms that are equivalent to matrix multiplication with smaller
base case, and use the de Groote equivalence to replace these parts in a way
that allows further optimization of our algorithms. Finally, we improve the
additive complexity of our algorithms by finding a sparse decomposition and
reducing the leading coefficient. These mark a fundamental step towards
outperforming existing fast matrix multiplication algorithms in practice.

Conclusion: MAT机制有效解决图算法中SVT误差放大问题，能为多个图问题提供更优算法。

Abstract: Many differentially private and classical non-private graph algorithms rely
crucially on determining whether some property of each vertex meets a
threshold. For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic
peeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls
below a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to
transform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small
additive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph
setting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to
composition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this
problem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we
call the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT
(applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As
an application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better
bounds than previous work.
  We apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety
of problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree
ordering, and vertex coloring. We give a tight local edge DP algorithm for
$k$-core decomposition with $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error and no
multiplicative error in $O(n)$ rounds. We also give a new $(2+\eta)$-factor
multiplicative, $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error algorithm in $O(\log^2
n)$ rounds for any constant $\eta > 0$. Both of these results are
asymptotically tight against our new lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for any
constant-factor approximation algorithm for $k$-core decomposition. Our new
algorithms for $k$-core also directly lead to new algorithms for densest
subgraph and low out-degree ordering. Our novel private defective coloring
algorithms uses number of colors proportional to the arboricity of the graph.

Abstract: A cover (or quasiperiod) of a string $S$ is a shorter string $C$ such that
every position of $S$ is contained in some occurrence of $C$ as a substring.
The notion of covers was introduced by Apostolico and Ehrenfeucht over 30 years
ago [Theor. Comput. Sci. 1993] and it has received significant attention from
the combinatorial pattern matching community. In this note, we show how to
efficiently test whether $S$ admits a cover. Our tester can also be translated
into a streaming algorithm.

Motivation: 经典聚类问题对异常值敏感，无约束异常值去除会引发公平性问题，需研究带公平约束的变体。

Method: 为带公平异常值的设施选址和k - 中位数问题分别设计双准则近似算法，并进行实证分析。

Result: 带公平异常值的设施选址问题有O(1/ϵ)近似因子和(1 + 2ϵ)异常值违反因子；k - 中位数问题有4(1 + ω/ϵ)近似因子和(ω + ϵ)异常值违反因子，避免了异常值违反依赖k。证明问题W[1] - 难。

Conclusion: 能以可忽略的成本增加实现公平性，标准LP的整数间隙在实践中较小。

Abstract: Classical clustering problems such as \emph{Facility Location} and
\emph{$k$-Median} aim to efficiently serve a set of clients from a subset of
facilities -- minimizing the total cost of facility openings and client
assignments in Facility Location, and minimizing assignment (service) cost
under a facility count constraint in $k$-Median. These problems are highly
sensitive to outliers, and therefore researchers have studied variants that
allow excluding a small number of clients as outliers to reduce cost. However,
in many real-world settings, clients belong to different demographic or
functional groups, and unconstrained outlier removal can disproportionately
exclude certain groups, raising fairness concerns.
  We study \emph{Facility Location with Fair Outliers}, where each group is
allowed a specified number of outliers, and the objective is to minimize total
cost while respecting group-wise fairness constraints. We present a bicriteria
approximation with a $O(1/\epsilon)$ approximation factor and $(1+ 2\epsilon)$
factor violation in outliers per group. For \emph{$k$-Median with Fair
Outliers}, we design a bicriteria approximation with a $4(1+\omega/\epsilon)$
approximation factor and $(\omega + \epsilon)$ violation in outliers per group
improving on prior work by avoiding dependence on $k$ in outlier violations. We
also prove that the problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by $\omega$, assuming
the Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  We complement our algorithmic contributions with a detailed empirical
analysis, demonstrating that fairness can be achieved with negligible increase
in cost and that the integrality gap of the standard LP is small in practice.

Result: 得到一个polylog(opt)竞争的均匀性跟踪算法。

Conclusion: 提出的均匀性跟踪问题及算法可解决现有均匀性测试任务的不足。

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an
unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide
whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total
variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This
question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,
by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of
interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a
prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity
tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity
(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be
competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in
hindsight. Our main contribution is a
$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking
algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on
Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

Result: 使用TF - IDF的ALMM实现比基线模型在冷启动场景下有更好的推荐准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion:  minimally modified状态下的ALMM不适合下一条新闻推荐。

Abstract: This replication study modifies ALMM, the Adaptive Linear Mapping Model
constructed for the next song recommendation, to the news recommendation
problem on the MIND dataset. The original version of ALMM computes latent
representations for users, last-time items, and current items in a tensor
factorization structure and learns a linear mapping from content features to
latent item vectors. Our replication aims to improve recommendation performance
in cold-start scenarios by restructuring this model to sequential news click
behavior, viewing consecutively read articles as (last news, next news) tuples.
Instead of the original audio features, we apply BERT and a TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to news titles and abstracts to extract
token contextualized representations and align them with triplet-based user
reading patterns. We also propose a reproducibly thorough pre-processing
pipeline combining news filtering and feature integrity validation. Our
implementation of ALMM with TF-IDF shows relatively improved recommendation
accuracy and robustness over Forbes and Oord baseline models in the cold-start
scenario. We demonstrate that ALMM in a minimally modified state is not
suitable for next news recommendation.

Conclusion: TWISTER生成的评论更有用、真实和具体，能平滑结构信号以改善推荐。

Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference
signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users
rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the
effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate
missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques
-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose
contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook
structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual
Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by
jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent
user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge
attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and
employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction
lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's
natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized
review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER
consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,
delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced
recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more
helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for
improved recommendations.

Abstract: Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of
contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that
optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the
objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw
together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity
mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit
hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within
the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among
extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our
hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment
through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with
similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within
the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity
between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution,
thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities
within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship
between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity
function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce
a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of
modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to
the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five
real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing
baselines. We also shown that the proposed methods can achieve up to a 5.4%
increase in NDCG@20 performance via the integration of MLLM-extracted features.

Abstract: Providing customized products and services in the modern business world is
one of the most efficient solutions to improve users' experience and their
engagements with the industries. To aim, recommender systems, by producing
personalized recommendations, have a crucial role in the digital age. As a
consequence of modern improvements in the internet and online-based
technologies, using gamification rules also increased in various fields. Recent
studies showed that considering gamification concepts in implementing
recommendation systems not only can become helpful to overcome the cold start
and lack of sufficient data, moreover, can effectively improve user engagement.
Gamification can motivate individuals to have more activities on the system;
these interactions are valuable resources of data for recommender engines.
Unlike the past related works about using gamified recommendation systems in
different environments or studies that particularly surveyed gamification
strategies or recommenders separately, this work provides a comprehensive
review of how gamified recommender systems can enhance user engagement in
various domain applications. Furthermore, comparing different approaches for
building recommender systems is followed by in-depth surveying about
investigating the gamified recommender systems, including their approaches,
limitations, evaluation metrics, proposed achievements, datasets, domain areas,
and their recommendation techniques. This exhaustive analysis provides a
detailed picture of the topic's popularity, gaps, and unexplored regions. It is
envisaged that the proposed research and introduced possible future directions
would serve as a stepping stone for researchers interested in using gamified
recommender systems for user satisfaction and engagement.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) is crucial for
accurately matching users with items. To improve recommendation performance for
cold-start and long-tail items, recent studies focus on leveraging item
multimodal features to model users' interests. However, obtaining multimodal
representations for items relies on complex pre-trained encoders, which incurs
unacceptable computation cost to train jointly with downstream ranking models.
Therefore, it is important to maintain alignment between semantic and behavior
space in a lightweight way.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic-Behavior Alignment for
Cold-start Recommendation framework, which mainly focuses on utilizing
multimodal representations that align with the user behavior space to predict
CTR. First, we leverage domain-specific knowledge to train a multimodal encoder
to generate behavior-aware semantic representations. Second, we use residual
quantized semantic ID to dynamically bridge the gap between multimodal
representations and the ranking model, facilitating the continuous
semantic-behavior alignment. We conduct our offline and online experiments on
the Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, and have achieved
an increase of 0.83% in offline AUC, 13.21% clicks increase and 13.44% orders
increase in the online A/B test, emphasizing the efficacy of our method.

Motivation: 项目成败与识别利益相关者及其需求密切相关，选择合适的需求获取技术是高效需求工程的挑战，推荐系统可用于与利益相关者进行个性化互动交流。

Method: 提出Req - Rec方法，它是基于协同过滤方法和量表网格技术的混合推荐系统。

Result: 该方法能有效克服常见需求获取技术的弱点，如时间限制、地域限制和需求获取过程中的偏差。

Conclusion: 推荐相关需求有助于利益相关者更全面了解项目不同方面。

Abstract: The success or failure of a project is highly related to recognizing the
right stakeholders and accurately finding and discovering their requirements.
However, choosing the proper elicitation technique was always a considerable
challenge for efficient requirement engineering. As a consequence of the swift
improvement of digital technologies since the past decade, recommender systems
have become an efficient channel for making a deeply personalized interactive
communication with stakeholders. In this research, a new method, called the
Req-Rec (Requirements Recommender), is proposed. It is a hybrid recommender
system based on the collaborative filtering approach and the repertory grid
technique as the core component. The primary goal of Req-Rec is to increase
stakeholder satisfaction by assisting them in the requirement elicitation
phase. Based on the results, the method efficiently could overcome weaknesses
of common requirement elicitation techniques, such as time limitation,
location-based restrictions, and bias in requirements' elicitation process.
Therefore, recommending related requirements assists stakeholders in becoming
more aware of different aspects of the project.

Conclusion: 集成LLM可提升推荐系统的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and
diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant
suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability
remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback
or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid
recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with
Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used
to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful
profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These
enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie
bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering
model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that
combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust
negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated
recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language
justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark
datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms
strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the
cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work
demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and
interpretability of recommender systems.

TL;DR: 为解决化学文献检索中通用文本嵌入模型表现不佳问题，提出ChEmbed模型，在新基准上表现优于现有模型，有效提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型难以充分表示复杂化学术语，导致检索质量不佳，且缺乏针对化学文献检索的专业嵌入模型。

Method: 基于PubChem、Semantic Scholar和ChemRxiv语料库的特定化学文本数据集微调ChEmbed模型；用大语言模型合成生成约170万个高质量查询 - 段落对；在分词器中添加900个化学专业标记；保持8192个标记的上下文长度。

Result: 在新引入的ChemRxiv Retrieval基准测试中，ChEmbed将nDCG@10从0.82提高到0.91（提高9个百分点）。

Conclusion: ChEmbed是一种实用、轻量级且可复现的嵌入解决方案，能有效改善化学文献搜索的检索效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on
accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However,
general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent
complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality.
Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not
yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this
challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding
models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the
PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training
data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries,
resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs.
Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized
tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the
fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains
a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer
passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically
have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced
ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general
embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents
a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively
improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

Motivation: 现有互惠推荐系统因日志数据中热门用户过度代表，存在反馈循环，影响学习和公平性。

Method: 引入Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender Systems (CFRR)因果框架，使用逆倾向得分、自归一化目标。

Result: CFRR使NDCG@10最多提升3.5%，长尾用户覆盖率最多增加51%，基尼曝光不平等最多降低24%。

Conclusion: CFRR为更准确和公平的用户匹配提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems (RRS) in dating, gaming, and talent platforms
require mutual acceptance for a match. Logged data, however, over-represents
popular profiles due to past exposure policies, creating feedback loops that
skew learning and fairness. We introduce Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender
Systems (CFRR), a causal framework to mitigate this bias. CFRR uses inverse
propensity scored, self-normalized objectives. Experiments show CFRR improves
NDCG@10 by up to 3.5% (e.g., from 0.459 to 0.475 on DBLP, from 0.299 to 0.307
on Synthetic), increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51% (from 0.504 to
0.763 on Synthetic), and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24% (from
0.708 to 0.535 on Synthetic). CFRR offers a promising approach for more
accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly explored as
general-purpose tools for recommendation tasks, enabling zero-shot and
instruction-following capabilities without the need for task-specific training.
While the research community is enthusiastically embracing LLMs, there are
important caveats to directly adapting them for recommendation tasks. In this
paper, we show that LLM-based recommendation models suffer from position bias,
where the order of candidate items in a prompt can disproportionately influence
the recommendations produced by LLMs. First, we analyse the position bias of
LLM-based recommendations on real-world datasets, where results uncover
systemic biases of LLMs with high sensitivity to input orders. Furthermore, we
introduce a new prompting strategy to mitigate the position bias of LLM
recommendation models called Ranking via Iterative SElection (RISE). We compare
our proposed method against various baselines on key benchmark datasets.
Experiment results show that our method reduces sensitivity to input ordering
and improves stability without requiring model fine-tuning or post-processing.

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，新模型在准确性和多样性方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 生成注意力机制为序列推荐提供了比传统注意力机制更灵活和富有表现力的替代方案。

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) focuses on personalizing user experiences by
predicting future preferences based on historical interactions. Transformer
models, with their attention mechanisms, have become the dominant architecture
in SR tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in user behavior
sequences. However, traditional attention mechanisms, where attention weights
are computed through query-key transformations, are inherently linear and
deterministic. This fixed approach limits their ability to account for the
dynamic and non-linear nature of user preferences, leading to challenges in
capturing evolving interests and subtle behavioral patterns. Given that
generative models excel at capturing non-linearity and probabilistic
variability, we argue that generating attention distributions offers a more
flexible and expressive alternative compared to traditional attention
mechanisms. To support this claim, we present a theoretical proof demonstrating
that generative attention mechanisms offer greater expressiveness and
stochasticity than traditional deterministic approaches. Building upon this
theoretical foundation, we introduce two generative attention models for SR,
each grounded in the principles of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion
Models (DMs), respectively. These models are designed specifically to generate
adaptive attention distributions that better align with variable user
preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our models
significantly outperform state-of-the-art in both accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research
attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains
limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly
in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23
empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been
conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate,
turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours
are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges,
including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address
these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative
analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for
LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more
transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods
still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling
annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical
queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional
relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces
two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from
multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate
structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from
intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial
elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and
prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance
annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the
generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method
to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed
a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k
Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and
rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,
benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and
validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training
and benchmarking.

Conclusion: 在重排序中显式建模用户退出情况有益。

Abstract: Re-ranking is critical in recommender systems for optimizing the order of
recommendation lists, thus improving user satisfaction and platform revenue.
Most existing methods follow a generator-evaluator paradigm, where the
evaluator estimates the overall value of each candidate list. However, they
often ignore the fact that users may exit before consuming the full list,
leading to a mismatch between estimated generation value and actual consumption
value. To bridge this gap, we propose CAVE, a personalized Consumption-Aware
list Value Estimation framework. CAVE formulates the list value as the
expectation over sub-list values, weighted by user-specific exit probabilities
at each position. The exit probability is decomposed into an interest-driven
component and a stochastic component, the latter modeled via a Weibull
distribution to capture random external factors such as fatigue. By jointly
modeling sub-list values and user exit behavior, CAVE yields a more faithful
estimate of actual list consumption value. We further contribute three
large-scale real-world list-wise benchmarks from the Kuaishou platform, varying
in size and user activity patterns. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks,
two Amazon datasets, and online A/B testing on Kuaishou show that CAVE
consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the benefit of
explicitly modeling user exits in re-ranking.

Motivation: 现有学习哈希方法的学习能力受质疑，且受限于三种哈希函数类型，因此探索Voronoi图在哈希中的潜力。

Method: 提出Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing (VDeH)方法，通过数据依赖的相似性度量构建哈希函数，通过编码哈希产生独立二进制位。

Result: 在多个基准数据集实验中，VDeH在相同比特长度下比现有方法性能更优，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Voronoi图在哈希中有潜力，VDeH方法简单高效。

Abstract: The goal of learning to hash (L2H) is to derive data-dependent hash functions
from a given data distribution in order to map data from the input space to a
binary coding space. Despite the success of L2H, two observations have cast
doubt on the source of the power of L2H, i.e., learning. First, a recent study
shows that even using a version of locality sensitive hashing functions without
learning achieves binary representations that have comparable accuracy as those
of L2H, but with less time cost. Second, existing L2H methods are constrained
to three types of hash functions: thresholding, hyperspheres, and hyperplanes
only. In this paper, we unveil the potential of Voronoi diagrams in hashing.
Voronoi diagram is a suitable candidate because of its three properties. This
discovery has led us to propose a simple and efficient no-learning binary
hashing method, called Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing (VDeH), which constructs
a set of hash functions through a data-dependent similarity measure and
produces independent binary bits through encoded hashing. We demonstrate
through experiments on several benchmark datasets that VDeH achieves superior
performance and lower computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods under the same bit length.

Conclusion: 向自适应、生成性和利益相关者感知系统发展对于满足时尚消费者和品牌不断变化的期望至关重要。

Abstract: Fashion recommender systems (FaRS) face distinct challenges due to rapid
trend shifts, nuanced user preferences, intricate item-item compatibility, and
the complex interplay among consumers, brands, and influencers. Traditional
recommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to
effectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user
satisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic
and industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder
ecosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users,
brands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and
modeling challenges that arise.
  We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five
representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and
multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to
combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a
particularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose
an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal
encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap
between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories. Our work
shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and
stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of
fashion consumers and brands.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is critical for reducing hallucinations
and incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, advanced RAG systems face a trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Multi-round RAG approaches achieve strong reasoning but incur
excessive LLM calls and token costs, while Graph RAG methods suffer from
computationally expensive, error-prone graph construction and retrieval
redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose T$^2$RAG, a novel framework
that operates on a simple, graph-free knowledge base of atomic triplets.
T$^2$RAG leverages an LLM to decompose questions into searchable triplets with
placeholders, which it then iteratively resolves by retrieving evidence from
the triplet database. Empirical results show that T$^2$RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art multi-round and Graph RAG methods, achieving an
average performance gain of up to 11\% across six datasets while reducing
retrieval costs by up to 45\%. Our code is available at

Conclusion: STIM 方法有效，已部署在大规模本地生活服务推荐系统中服务数亿日活用户。

Abstract: In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a
key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling
user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity
of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be
addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This
is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect
and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the
forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)
with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates
three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,
which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic
spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that
can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling
the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical
multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by

TL;DR: 本文提出R3A模型解决UGC平台检索增强生成中查询 - 文档相关性评估问题，实验显示其效果优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGC平台在检索增强生成的相关性评估中存在用户意图模糊和语言噪声大的问题，现有大语言模型应用有局限。

Method: 提出R3A模型，引入分解推理框架，利用辅助高排名文档推断潜在查询意图，进行逐字片段提取，基于强化学习框架优化。

Result: R3A在离线基准测试和在线实验中，相关性准确性显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: R3A能有效解决UGC平台相关性评估问题，在该场景具有较好效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated
content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate
relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in
applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms
present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback
in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and
unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced
Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed
reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A
first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer
latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify
relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a
reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions
arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results
show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of
relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.

TL;DR: 本文分析Inverted Softmax方法，提出概率平衡框架，引入Sinkhorn Normalization (SN) 及Dual Bank Sinkhorn Normalization (DBSN) 减少跨模态检索中的枢纽性问题，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有减少枢纽性问题的方法机制不明，且当前仅依赖查询库估计目标枢纽性的方法效果不佳。

Method: 分析Inverted Softmax方法，提出概率平衡框架，引入SN平衡查询和目标概率，提出DBSN结合目标库缩小分布差距。

Result: 在图像 - 文本、视频 - 文本和音频 - 文本等跨模态检索任务中取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: SN和DBSN在减少跨模态检索枢纽性问题上有效，代码公开。

Abstract: The past decade has witnessed rapid advancements in cross-modal retrieval,
with significant progress made in accurately measuring the similarity between
cross-modal pairs. However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where
a small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous
queries, continues to hinder the precision of similarity measurements. Despite
several proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain
poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we analyze the widely-adopted Inverted
Softmax approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing target
probabilities during retrieval. Building on these insights, we propose a
probability-balancing framework for more effective hubness reduction. We
contend that balancing target probabilities alone is inadequate and, therefore,
extend the framework to balance both query and target probabilities by
introducing Sinkhorn Normalization (SN). Notably, we extend SN to scenarios
where the true query distribution is unknown, showing that current methods,
which rely solely on a query bank to estimate target hubness, produce
suboptimal results due to a significant distributional gap between the query
bank and targets. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn
Normalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the
query bank to narrow this distributional gap. Our comprehensive evaluation
across various cross-modal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval,
video-text retrieval, and audio-text retrieval, demonstrates consistent
performance improvements, validating the effectiveness of both SN and DBSN. All
codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ppanzx/DBSN.

Method: 提出更新和简化的PCS工作流，结合生成式AI，通过运行示例和案例研究展示。

Result: 展示了PCS框架的实际应用，以及数据清理阶段判断对下游预测不确定性的影响。

Conclusion: 更新的PCS工作流结合生成式AI能为数据科学中解决不确定性问题提供有效途径。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Result: 通用神经元对模型预测有显著功能影响，且在训练检查点中稳定性高，深层更明显。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练中会出现稳定且通用的表征结构。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained
GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with
consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout
training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k
steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of
activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Result: LLM引导的代理在回报和风险指标上优于标准RL

Conclusion: 基于LLM引导RL代理的混合系统能有效改进算法交易表现

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

TL;DR: 本文提出动态个性化框架识别危险驾驶行为，评估不同模型和指标，指出自适应个性化风险检测方法对提升交通安全有价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有危险驾驶行为监测框架依赖固定时间窗口和静态阈值，难以应对现实驾驶的随机性，需新方法。

Method: 利用比利时自然驾驶数据，采用滚动时间窗口和双层优化动态校准风险阈值和模型超参数，用随机森林、XGBoost和深度神经网络评估两个安全指标。

Result: DNN在捕捉驾驶行为细微变化和高召回任务中表现出色；XGBoost性能平衡稳定；随机森林对动态阈值调整敏感；速度加权车头时距是更稳定、上下文敏感的风险指标。

Conclusion: 自适应、个性化风险检测方法对提升智能交通系统实时安全反馈和驾驶员支持有价值。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Result: 在Allen - Cahn、Klein - Gordon和Navier - Stokes方程实验中，相对MSE最多降低三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合深度学习与物理驱动建模差距，为多尺度和时变PDE系统提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Motivation: 现代神经网络主流范式依赖简单单调激活函数，需大量参数近似复杂函数，有提升空间。

Method: 引入Periodic Linear Unit (PLU)激活函数，采用Repulsive Reparameterization防止其退化为无表现力的线性函数。

Result: 仅含两个PLU神经元的最小MLP可解决螺旋分类任务，而使用标准激活函数的等效网络无法完成。

Conclusion: 可从分段泰勒近似器范式转变为傅里叶函数合成器范式，将智能置于神经元中以提升参数效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

TL;DR: 传统SVD压缩技术在推理时存在激活内存开销问题，无法减少峰值推理内存。本文提出FlashSVD框架，可削减激活内存和中间瞬态内存，且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往基于SVD的方法主要关注模型权重内存占用，忽略推理时激活内存开销，导致无法减少峰值推理内存，限制实际设备部署。

Method: 引入FlashSVD框架，将低秩投影内核融合到自注意力和前馈网络管道中，加载小图块进行计算并及时逐出，保持高GPU占用且无额外延迟。

Result: 在标准编码器基准测试中，FlashSVD最多削减70.2%的峰值激活内存和75%的中间瞬态内存，且不损失精度。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩大语言模型在内存受限环境下的部署提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics

overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency

Result: 在大规模压力测试的真实微服务基准上评估，相比现有基线模型，预测准确性有显著提高。

Conclusion: USRFNet 网络能有效解决微服务性能监控和资源管理问题，提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

Motivation: 传统基于模型的感应电机诊断方法需复杂动态模型，实现困难且计算成本高，因此提出无模型方法。

Method: 提出GNN - ASE模型，以原始电流和振动信号为输入，自动学习和提取特征，利用图结构捕捉信号与故障模式关系，进行单故障检测和多故障分类评估。

Conclusion: 该基于GNN的框架轻量级且强大，简化实现同时保持高诊断性能，是传统方法的有前景替代方案。

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Method: 提出使用Polya - Gamma增强的可扩展Gibbs采样器和Laplace近似，并与MFVI和HMC进行比较，处理词嵌入的非可识别性。

Result: Gibbs采样器和HMC能正确估计不确定性，Laplace近似在大样本下可行，Gibbs采样器在真实数据集上可行，后验均值在保留似然方面优于MAP估计。

Conclusion: 词嵌入的后验采样很有必要，尤其是在小样本情况下，所提出的Gibbs采样器是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Conclusion: 该框架集成到工程设计生命周期可提高设计师生产力和整体设计性能。

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在温和条件下继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性，可用于解决随机最优控制问题。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Motivation: 现有投影松弛方法解决图匹配QAP问题时扩大可行集，带来数值尺度敏感和几何不对齐误差。

Method: 将投影步骤重新表述为Frobenius正则化线性分配问题（FRA），提出Scaling Doubly Stochastic Normalization（SDSN）算法求解FRA，开发混合精度架构加速。

Result: CPU基准测试显示FRAM在相同精度设置下优于所有基线方法，结合GPU混合精度架构比CPU - FP64版本加速达370倍，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 提出的FRA框架和SDSN算法有效，能解决现有方法的问题并实现加速。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Conclusion: GRAD能有效应对现代广告商不断变化和多样的需求。

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return

Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and

Conclusion: CRINN的成功表明强化学习增强的大语言模型可作为自动化复杂算法优化的有效工具。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Result: 在五个不同的真实世界图上实验，框架在各类图中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于学习的最短路径搜索提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Result: 发现潜在边界分布与检测器对后处理图像的泛化能力有强相关性。

Conclusion: 可以通过在不同条件下训练模型并选择潜在边界最大的模型来构建更鲁棒的拼接检测器。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究将Gibbs测度用作随机数值积分算法，探讨调整其参数使平衡测度为目标分布的问题，利用大偏差方法证明随机近似势可使算法表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出用Gibbs测度作为随机数值积分算法，但需调整其交互核和约束势使平衡测度为目标分布，通常需蒙特卡罗近似势，因此研究随机近似势对算法性能的影响。

Method: 运用Garcia - Zelada (2019)的大偏差方法进行分析。

Result: 证明随机近似势能保留快速大偏差原理，使积分算法优于独立或马尔可夫求积法；对非奇异交互核，对随机近似假设极少；对库仑交互核，需基于另一个Gibbs测度近似，并证明了势近似的一致收敛性。

Conclusion: 随机近似势可保证所提出的积分算法有良好表现。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

TL;DR: 随着大语言模型工具使用增加，需高效推理系统。本文提出理论框架，设计RAD和SLAI调度器，实验显示SLAI效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型工具广泛使用，其推理系统的两阶段计算结构需要新的请求路由和调度策略。

Method: 开发理论框架，确定最优平铺和动态资源分配两个关键原则，提出RAD调度器并证明其吞吐量最优性，设计SLAI调度器以满足服务水平目标。

Result: 在Openchat ShareGPT4数据集和Mistral - 7B模型上实验，与Sarathi - Serve相比，SLAI使中位TTFT降低53%，最大服务容量增加26%，满足尾部TBT延迟约束。

Conclusion: 所设计的调度器能有效提升大语言模型推理系统性能。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Motivation: 实际机器学习场景有特征相关数据，当前容量分析未考虑此情况，需研究特征相关性对DAM容量的影响。

Method: 开发实证框架，用信息论的汉明距离构建不同特征相关性和模式分离度的数据集，用二分搜索算法计算存储容量。

Result: 记忆容量随输入空间分离度指数增长，特征相关性不改变此关系但会稍降低容量，在能量函数多项式次数更高时影响更明显。

Conclusion: 研究成果连接了DAM的理论和实际应用，可能启发更多以数据为中心的方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Motivation: 现有自监督时间序列异常检测方法依赖单一代理任务，且需特定领域手工转换，泛化能力受限。

Method: 引入NeuCoReClass AD框架，结合对比、重建和分类代理任务，采用神经转换学习生成增强视图。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NeuCoReClass AD始终优于经典基线和多数深度学习方法，能以完全无监督方式刻画不同异常特征。

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了时间序列异常检测性能。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Motivation: 商业大语言模型服务隐藏推理痕迹并对所有生成代币收费，存在代币膨胀和过度计费问题，需要可靠代币审计方法。

Method: 提出用户侧框架PALACE，通过推理代币计数估计来估算隐藏推理代币数量，引入GRPO增强适应模块和轻量级领域路由器。

Result: 在数学、编码、医学和通用推理基准测试中，PALACE实现了低相对误差和强预测准确性，支持细粒度成本审计和膨胀检测。

Conclusion: PALACE为标准化预测审计迈出重要一步，有助于提高透明度、问责性和用户信任。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Conclusion: 改进分类器和OOD检测器的校准对安全半监督学习至关重要，CaliMatch方法有效。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

Conclusion: 启发式加权虽简单，但能使训练更稳定高效。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

Conclusion: HHN框架在复杂分类任务中有效。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习存在通信开销、系统异构和掉队效应问题，AFL需进一步扩展以处理非凸目标函数和异构数据集。

Method: 进行严格的收敛分析，引入陈旧感知聚合和动态学习率调度，分析客户端选择策略，用PyTorch和Python的asyncio实现。

Result: 实验证明该方法在异步、异构和非凸联邦学习场景中性能和可扩展性得到提升。

Conclusion: 所提框架能适应计算能力、数据分布和通信延迟的变化，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出OKG - LLM框架用于全球海表温度（SST）预测，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法未充分利用领域知识，限制SST预测精度提升，且大语言模型在SST预测应用未充分探索。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），开发图嵌入网络学习OKG知识，将知识与细粒度SST数值数据融合，用预训练大语言模型建模预测。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验，OKG - LLM始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OKG - LLM有效、稳健，有提升SST预测能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

TL;DR: 提出U^2QT框架解决多源用户表示学习现有问题，实验显示其在多任务有优势且支持工业应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多源用户表示学习的晚期融合策略有缺乏统一框架、数据压缩可扩展性和存储问题及跨任务泛化不灵活等局限。

Method: 提出U^2QT框架，采用两阶段架构，先通过因果Q - Former投影特征到共享空间，再用多视图RQ - VAE离散嵌入成紧凑令牌。

Result: U^2QT在下游任务表现优于特定基线，在存储和计算上有效率提升。

Conclusion: 统一的令牌化框架能与语言模型无缝集成，支持工业规模应用。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Result: 在代表性CV任务实验中，FedDPQ收敛速度和能效表现优越。

Conclusion: FedDPQ是首个在不可靠无线条件下从数据、计算和通信角度联合优化FL性能的工作。

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Motivation: 传统方法在复杂多变量时间序列因果关系发现中存在依赖线性假设或条件独立性测试在非线性动态下失效的问题。

Method: 提出TD2C范式，从统计测试转向模式识别，用信息论和统计描述符学习因果特征，在合成时间序列上训练。

Result: TD2C零样本泛化能力强，在高维、非线性场景中表现超越现有方法，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义问题，为复杂系统因果结构发现提供了强大且可扩展的新工具。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

Result: 在14个公开数据集和1个行业数据集上，相比现有方法平均多减少15%特征，计算时间最多减少99.6%；与PSO结合时，多减少25%特征，计算时间减少66%，且保持模型性能。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts开销小，可用于企业应用中的大型数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Motivation: 异步性和去中心化使联邦学习中客户端退出后恢复困难，现有缓解方法不足。

Method: 提出基于客户端重建的自适应策略，在表格和图像数据集上评估，涉及三种DFL算法和三种数据异质性场景。

Result: 实验表明提出的自适应策略能有效维持联邦学习的鲁棒性，即便不能精确重建缺失客户端数据。

Conclusion: 自适应策略可缓解客户端退出导致的性能损失，文章还指出了局限性和未来研究方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Motivation: 解决现有主动特征获取方法中强化学习训练困难和贪婪最大化条件互信息导致短视获取的问题。

Method: 引入有监督训练的潜变量模型，在随机潜空间中对多个可能未观察到的特征实现进行推理来进行特征获取。

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法可靠地优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的潜变量模型能有效解决现有主动特征获取方法的不足，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Motivation: 数据隐私问题及获取源数据困难催生无数据源迁移学习，现有方法依赖源数据，且实际场景存在模型选择和使用难题。

Method: 提出一个模型回收框架，用于模型的参数高效训练，能在白盒和黑盒设置中识别相关源模型子集进行复用。

Result: 该框架使模型即服务（MaaS）提供商能够构建高效预训练模型库。

Conclusion: 此框架为多源无数据监督迁移学习创造了机会。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia上准确率分别达91%和84%，引入未见类别后准确率变化小。

Conclusion: 基于提示的语义推理在有限监督下进行细粒度分类有效。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Result: 数值结果显示SplitMe在成本和收敛性上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O - RANFed等框架。

Conclusion: SplitMe能有效解决O - RAN中联邦学习的训练时间、通信成本和资源分配问题，有更好性能。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Conclusion: 为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法指明新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Conclusion: 所提出的技术可根据数据可用性、资源和建模目标进行定制，克服各种场景下的可扩展性挑战。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Result: 在11个真实数据集上实验，最佳情况精度提升15%，平均精度高3%，计算成本降低超90%。

Conclusion: PTBCC方法能有效解决现有问题，实现更可靠、丰富的标注者估计。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Result: 在三个真实数据集和五个流行推荐系统模型上实验表明，DLDA比先前攻击实现更强物品推广且更难被检测。

Conclusion: 现代推荐系统比之前认为的更脆弱，急需更强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Motivation: 现代深度网络训练动态理解不足，多依赖经验调整，研究内部结构选择如何影响学习系统行为。

Method: 基于引入简单架构约束的前期工作，采用富集变换层，结合理论分析和对合成及结构化任务的实证研究。

Result: 发现结构影响梯度流等的机制，实现了更好的鲁棒性、更平滑的优化和可扩展的深度行为。

Conclusion: 架构设计不仅是性能调优，是塑造可扩展且可信神经系统学习动态的关键因素。

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Method: 引入包含大量实体、关系三元组和关系类型的FinKario数据集，自动整合实时信息；提出FinKario - RAG两阶段图检索策略优化知识检索。

Conclusion: FinKario数据集和FinKario - RAG检索策略能有效解决大语言模型利用研报辅助投资者决策时的问题，提升股票趋势预测准确性。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

TL;DR: 论文提出BOOST框架自动化选择贝叶斯优化（BO）的核函数与采集函数组合，经实验验证其优于固定超参的标准BO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BO性能受超参选择影响大，现有研究忽视核函数与采集函数的联合自主选择，从业者依赖启发式方法或手动训练。

Method: 提出BOOST框架，通过轻量级离线评估阶段，将数据划分为参考子集和查询子集，对所有核 - 采集函数对进行内部BO运行，评估其在查询子集的寻优效果，选出最佳配置。

Result: 在合成基准函数和实际超参优化任务实验中，BOOST始终优于固定超参的标准BO方法。

Conclusion: BOOST在不同问题场景中有效且鲁棒，能自动化选择最佳核 - 采集函数对。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究互补特征域对多模态深度学习生物医学信号分类模型性能的影响，重新定义多模态设计原则。

Method: 设计并评估五个深度学习模型（三个单模态和两个多模态），采用自举法和贝叶斯推理进行验证，开展针对性消融研究。

Result: Hybrid 1在各指标上优于2D - CNN基线，Hybrid 2加入频率域无提升甚至有下降，存在表征冗余。

Conclusion: 多模态设计中最优域融合取决于特征域互补质量而非数量，提出可量化框架识别理想域组合。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

TL;DR: 提出VAULT，一种自动化对抗性RAG管道，通过三个阶段提升NLI模型，在多个基准测试中提高了模型准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统地发现并弥补NLI模型的弱点，提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过检索、对抗性生成和迭代再训练三个阶段，先进行平衡少样本检索，再生成对抗性假设并验证，最后将验证后的对抗性示例注入训练集。

Result: 在标准基准测试中提升了RoBERTa - base模型在SNLI、ANLI和MultiNLI上的准确率，且在各数据集上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: VAULT实现了大规模高质量对抗性数据的自动化管理，能在NLI推理任务中实现快速、无需人工干预的鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI
inference tasks.

Motivation: 单纯组织病理学在分子特征和临床结果分析方面不足，需结合多组学数据。

Method: 引入基于transformer的MORPHEUS框架，将组织病理学和多组学数据编码到共享潜空间，使用掩码建模目标学习跨模态关系。

Result: 在大规模泛癌队列上预训练，在多种模态组合和任务中性能超现有方法。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是有前景的肿瘤多模态基础模型开发框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

Motivation: 传统谱嵌入方法嵌入空间表达能力有限，无法全面捕捉潜在结构特征。

Method: 使用图分数傅里叶变换将GEFFE扩展到分数域得到GEFRFE，利用图分数域滤波和分数化图拉普拉斯矩阵的特征向量分量的非线性组合，引入基于搜索的优化和基于ResNet18的自适应学习两种策略确定分数阶。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，GEFRFE能捕获更丰富的结构特征，显著提高分类性能。

Conclusion: GEFRFE方法有效，能提升嵌入信息和分类性能，且计算复杂度与GEFFE相当。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Conclusion: v - PuNNs桥接数论和深度学习，为分层数据提供精确、可解释和高效模型。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset
and evaluation code are available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

Result: 在包括高维WeatherBench数据集变体等多个具有挑战性的动力系统上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效应对动力系统学习中变量缺失和数据噪声问题，可用于复杂高维动力系统的概率预测。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Motivation: 用户属性对现代推荐系统很重要，可缓解冷启动问题，提升新用户体验。

Method: 提出BUS树，以NDCG为目标函数构建，结合社交图生成连接感知的推荐，融合用户自身和连接段的行为模式。

Conclusion: 该研究是首个大规模工业级树状推荐的列表式学习排序框架，有效整合多样用户属性并保留语义可解释性。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Motivation: PRNGs是大语言模型优化关键，Transformers擅长处理复杂非线性关系，因此探索基于Transformer生成高质量伪随机数的可能性。

Method: 从理论上证明仅解码器的Transformer模型结合思维链可模拟线性同余生成器和梅森旋转算法PRNGs，通过实验验证理论发现。

Result: Transformer-based PRNGs生成的随机数通过多数NIST测试，热图展现出明显统计随机性。

Conclusion: 对数精度的仅解码器Transformer可表示非均匀AC⁰ 。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Method: 识别影响合并的两个有害因素，提出DisTaC方法，利用知识蒸馏调整任务向量范数和增加源模型置信度。

Result: 通过DisTaC预处理任务向量，现有合并技术能成功整合有有害特征的模型，取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: DisTaC方法能有效解决模型合并中存在的问题，提升合并性能。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

TL;DR: 提出Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S)统一框架解决终身模仿学习问题，实验证明其有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理减轻灾难性遗忘和获取新技能问题，忽略了二者在终身技能获取中的内在联系。

Method: 提出T2S框架，通过对模型参数进行标记化，将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转换为输入与可学习标记之间的交叉注意力；引入语言引导的技能扩展。

Result: 有效防止灾难性遗忘（三个LIBERO任务套件平均NBT为1.0%）；在新技能扩展方面表现出色，可训练参数增加极少（终身任务平均只需8.0%可训练标记）；实现任务间高效知识转移（三个LIBERO任务套件平均FWT为77.7%）。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

Motivation: 强化学习在自动投资组合管理中平衡风险和回报面临挑战，许多模型无法适应动态市场条件。

Method: 提出MARS框架，使用异质智能体集成，每个智能体有独特风险偏好，由安全批评网络和风险容忍阈值控制；采用元自适应控制器动态协调智能体。

Result: 在主要国际股票指数实验中，该框架在风险调整标准上表现有效，显著降低最大回撤和波动性，同时保持有竞争力的回报。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过利用行为多样性而非显式市场特征工程，实现了风险和回报的更好平衡，生成了对市场波动具有鲁棒性的投资组合。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

Method: 提出Risk - Seeking Policy Optimization (RSPO)方法，利用给定响应在k次采样中为最大值的闭式概率解决“搭便车”问题，生成有效无偏梯度估计器。

Result: 通过严格理论分析和全面实验结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RSPO方法能解决大语言模型后训练与评估风险偏好不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

Result: GOODIE在少量特征和丰富特征情况下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE框架能有效处理图节点特征缺失问题，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

### [231] [Exploitation Is All You Need... for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01287)

TL;DR: 研究发现在特定条件下，仅训练最大化贪婪目标的元强化学习代理可出现探索行为，探索与利用可统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练元强化学习代理在新环境中充分探索的挑战。

Method: 提出三个条件，在随机多臂老虎机和时间扩展网格世界中实验，并进行控制消融实验。

Result: 有环境结构和代理记忆时，贪婪目标策略有探索行为；缺少环境结构或代理记忆探索行为消失；去除长时信用分配不一定阻止探索行为。

Conclusion: 在合适前提条件下，探索和利用可从统一的奖励最大化过程中产生。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

TL;DR: 传统交叉验证方法有局限，文章提出融合抽样验证（FSV）混合模型优化数据划分，实验表明FSV表现优于传统方法，在数据划分上更准确可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交叉验证方法（如KFCV）存在计算需求高、数据混洗多影响泛化评估的问题，简单随机抽样（SRS）在处理不平衡数据时会产生非代表性集，因此需要优化数据划分方法。

Method: 引入结合SRS和KFCV的混合模型FSV，使用三个不同规模的正态分布数据集，对KFCV设置五折十次重复并加入缩放因子，FSV加入加权因子，评估指标包括ME、VE、MSE等。

Result: FSV在各项评估指标上表现优于SRS和KFCV，ME为0.000863，VE为0.949644，MSE为0.952127等。

Conclusion: FSV在数据划分上具有更高的准确性和可靠性，尤其适用于资源受限环境和大规模数据集，为机器学习有效实施提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Method: 提出新的实用次优性估计器。

Result: 不同环境和RL算法实验显示，最佳生成经验比策略学习性能好2 - 3倍。

Conclusion: 深度RL方法仅利用了其生成的一半好经验。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Result: 证明SP和PS聚合方法都满足收敛条件，但达到最优收敛率的能力不同，标准基准测试实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 理论分析为各种聚合策略提供了原则性理解。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Method: 提出Concept - and Physics - enhanced Transformer（CPformer），通过五个自监督、领域无关概念进行预测，同时施加来自第一性原理约束的可微残差。

Result: 在六个公开数据集测试中，CPformer在12个MSE/MAE指标中的8个取得最低误差，相对FEDformer在部分数据集显著降低均方误差。

Conclusion: CPformer模型在多变量时间序列预测中有效，能结合潜在透明度与科学指导，保留长上下文注意力。

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Result: 实验表明UniExtreme在极端和一般气象预报上优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: UniExtreme具有在不同极端场景下的优越适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Result: 在32个基准不平衡回归数据集上评估，该方法始终优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的完全数据驱动的方法能有效解决不平衡回归问题，效果良好。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet无需训练和调参，泛化能力好，是现实分类任务可扩展高效的选择。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的时间序列编辑器依赖预定义属性向量，条件格式缺乏灵活性，编辑强度不可定制，需要改进。

Method: 引入基于指令的时间序列编辑，提出InstructTime，将时间序列和指令嵌入共享多模态表示空间，使用多分辨率编码器处理局部和全局编辑。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实验，InstructTime能实现高质量、强度可控的编辑，可泛化到未见指令，能通过少样本学习适应未见条件。

Conclusion: InstructTime是一种先进的时间序列编辑器，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

Motivation: 现代深度预测模型因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知归纳先验，难以捕捉时间序列的周期性结构。

Method: 通过快速傅里叶变换引导的坐标下降提取主导低频分量，用这些分量初始化正弦嵌入，并采用双速学习策略，该方法与模型无关，可集成到现有的基于Transformer的架构中。

Conclusion: 向深度时间模型中注入频谱先验有助于实现稳健且可解释的长程预测。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在刚性系统中，训练时控制快速衰减模式的参数敏感性变得极小，导致优化困难，需探究梯度消失现象的本质。

Method: 分析一般刚性积分方案的有理稳定函数，给出常见刚性积分方案的显式公式，并进行严格证明。

Result: 发现梯度消失现象是所有A - 稳定和L - 稳定刚性数值积分方案的普遍特征，得出稳定函数导数最慢衰减率为$O(|z|^{-1})$。

Conclusion: 所有A - 稳定时间步长方法在刚性区域不可避免地抑制参数梯度，对刚性神经ODE的训练和参数识别构成重大障碍。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

Conclusion: 所提概率方法能有效解决基本最短路径问题，具有良好性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Conclusion: KAN可作为长时序列预测新核心，分析了KANMixer优劣，给出使用KAN的实用指引。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

Conclusion: DC - PFL能有效解决联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Conclusion: CAMEL框架能有效应对多数据流学习中的异构性和概念漂移问题，具备良好的泛化性和抗漂移能力。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

TL;DR: 提出TCDiff框架生成电子健康记录，构建TCM - SZ1数据集，实验显示TCDiff优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子健康记录数据稀缺，现有合成方法在处理异构多模态数据、捕捉依赖关系和处理数据不完整方面有局限，尤其是在中医领域。

Method: 提出TCDiff框架，级联三个扩散网络学习真实电子健康记录数据特征，构建多阶段生成过程；构建TCM - SZ1数据集用于基准测试。

Result: TCDiff在不同缺失率下数据保真度平均比现有基线高10%，并能保证隐私。

Conclusion: TCDiff在现实医疗场景中有效、稳健且具有通用性。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受攻击且存在隐私泄露风险，现有机器学习遗忘算法依赖原始训练数据或有其他不足，需改进。

Method: 提出Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU)方法，使用梯度上升，基于数据影响动态分配遗忘强度。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务中，IMU始终优于现有的无保留数据的机器学习遗忘方法。

Conclusion: IMU方法简单有效，能在增强遗忘效果的同时保持模型效用。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

TL;DR: 提出EAC - MoE解决MoE扩展大语言模型时GPU内存消耗大及推理加速效果不佳问题，经实验能降低内存使用并提升推理速度且性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE在扩展大语言模型时存在的GPU内存消耗大以及低激活参数无法有效转化为推理加速效果的问题。

Method: 提出EAC - MoE，包括通过Quantization with Expert - Selection Calibration (QESC)校准路由器减轻低比特量化导致的专家选择偏差；通过Pruning based on Expert - Selection Frequency (PESF)剪枝不常用专家提升推理速度。

Result: 显著减少内存使用，提高推理速度，且性能仅有极小下降。

Conclusion: EAC - MoE能有效解决MoE面临的问题，在降低内存和提升推理速度方面表现良好。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决生成式机器学习模型安全推理的开销问题，实现高效安全推理。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

Motivation: 现有方法在处理结构化表格数据时，难以对数值和分类特征进行有效编码，也无法保留表格结构，因此需新的数据表示方法。

Method: 提出混合标记化方法，结合预定义固定标记和字节对编码（BPE）学习的子词词汇表，将表格数据转换为统一序列格式。

Result: 在CIDDS - 001数据集上，该方法高效处理超3100万个网络流，数据压缩比达6.18:1，生成超10亿个标记的语料库。

Conclusion: 该方法为在结构化数据上训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的途径。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

Result: PHAR表现与原生基于规则方法相当，能高效处理长序列、扩大实例覆盖，解决解释冲突问题。

Conclusion: 在UCI数据集实验表明，PHAR提升了时间序列分类任务的可解释性、决策透明度和实际适用性。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Conclusion: CcGAN - AVAR能在保持采样效率的同时实现最优生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Method: 提出OccamVTS知识蒸馏框架，利用预训练大视觉模型作为教师，采用金字塔式特征对齐、相关性和特征蒸馏来传递有益模式并过滤语义噪声。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，OccamVTS仅用1%原始参数就能持续达到最优性能，在少样本和零样本场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: OccamVTS通过去除对无关视觉特征的过拟合、保留关键时间模式，在减少参数的同时提高了预测准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: AGFT能显著提高现有LLM推理集群的能源效率和经济效益，且不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Conclusion: SemGuide能有效解决扩散模型在时间序列预测中的语义对齐问题，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient

gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference

ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable

Conclusion: PCPO框架为约束下的策略优化提供了强大解决方案，对未来研究和实际应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

Motivation: 当前语言模型内部表征干预有效条件不明确，常靠启发式和试错验证，需填补该空白。

Method: 提出“干预检测器”（ID）框架，通过隐藏状态和表征分析揭示线性可操纵性在训练中的演变，引入ID指标并跨模型族应用。

Result: 线性可操纵性在训练中间阶段出现，相关概念的可操纵性在不同训练阶段出现，训练中概念在隐藏空间线性可分性增加，与线性可操纵性出现强相关。

Conclusion: 研究明确了语言模型内部表征干预有效条件的相关情况，所提方法和指标可用于解释和验证不同模型族的可操纵性动态。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

Motivation: 大语言模型预训练在新数据可用时需从头开始，持续预训练可避免此问题，但新数据会导致分布偏移，降低旧任务性能，因此研究解决分布偏移的方法。

Method: 对Llama架构模型进行大规模跨语言持续预训练，评估经验回放和梯度对齐方法，提出高效元经验回放实现方法并进行不同模型规模和回放率的缩放分析。

Result: 经验回放和梯度对齐能实现稳定学习且不忘旧知识，梯度对齐技术在大语言模型预训练中有效，小比例回放旧样本比增大模型规模更有计算价值，增大模型规模比高比例回放旧样本计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 经验回放和梯度对齐是解决大语言模型持续预训练分布偏移问题的有效方法，可实现稳定学习，还提出了高效的元经验回放实现方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Method: 采用邻域距离最小化（NDM）方法，无监督学习非基对齐子空间。

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释，定量实验表明子空间与电路变量有强联系，且该方法可扩展到2B模型。

Conclusion: 研究为理解模型内部和构建电路提供新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Conclusion: 所提方法能提升解释鲁棒性和质量，可灵活集成不同架构。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了现有自动机推理方法的局限，能高效进行自动机推断。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Conclusion: 结构化、流感知的GNN有加速物理网络系统组合优化的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型多任务微调时，需要参数高效且表达性强的适配器的问题。

Method: 将冻结线性更新分解为Kronecker积，再对其中一部分进行低秩LoRA分解。

Result: Kron - LoRA比标准LoRA使用参数少，量化时精度损失小，在多任务基准测试中表现佳，跨任务迁移性能好。

Conclusion: Kron - LoRA为大语言模型多任务适应提供了可扩展、可持续且适用于持续学习的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Conclusion: 早期拒绝是提高大语言模型推理计算效率的有力机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架是首个结合基于大语言模型的图引导知识检索方法与结构化数据以改善临床结果预测的医疗预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

Method: 提出KAFNet架构，包含Pre - Convolution、Temporal Kernel Aggregation和Frequency Linear Attention模块。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上达到了最先进的预测性能，参数减少7.2倍，训练推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet架构有效，保留CPA并合理处理预对齐序列能超越不使用CPA的图基模型。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于演化场景的自动驾驶测试方法中，驾驶员模型构建方法对生成安全关键场景至关重要，背景车辆间的协作对抗驾驶特性有助于高效生成高测试价值场景。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法训练生成具有非对抗和对抗驾驶模式的双模态驾驶员模型（Dual - DM），连接连续模拟交通环境，通过演化场景生成方法生成场景并从保真度、测试效率、复杂性和多样性方面评估。

Result: 在不降低场景保真度（与现实场景相似度>85%）和复杂性（复杂度指标0.45，比两个基线分别高32.35%和12.5%）的情况下，Dual - DM在生成安全关键场景的效率上大幅提升（效率指标0.86，比两个基线高195%），且生成的场景在对抗交互模式上具有多样性。

Conclusion: Dual - DM可通过演化场景生成方法大大提高安全关键场景的生成性能。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

TL;DR: 本文分析大语言模型编码输出可靠性，提出自信 - 多样性双信号，建立三层工作流，经多领域验证可用于定性研究校准AI判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽能大规模定性编码，但在人类专家难达成共识的领域评估其输出可靠性有挑战。

Method: 分析8个先进大语言模型在10个主题类别下的5680个编码决策，利用模型平均自信度和模型多样性构建双信号，并建立三层工作流。

Result: 模型平均自信度与模型间一致性密切相关，自信 - 多样性双信号能几乎完全解释一致性；三层工作流可自动接受35%片段且审计错误率<5%，最多削减65%人工工作量；跨领域验证有显著效果。

Conclusion: 建立了可推广、基于证据的定性研究中校准AI判断的标准。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph
structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph
influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces
challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: Epi² - Net为未来疫情防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Result: MolReasoner增强可解释性，提升模型分子理解和泛化能力，实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MolReasoner实现从基于记忆输出到强大化学推理的显著转变。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Method: 引入新SNN架构，嵌入时间特征和自适应矩阵，用OBS Block学习序列特征，MSSA层次聚合邻域信息，DSF Block融合空间图特征和时间动态。

Result: 模型在所有数据集上超越基于SNN的iSpikformer，在长时预测中优于传统时间模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为高效时空建模建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 解决LoRA微调时即使微小更新也会导致对齐漂移，削弱安全和行为约束的问题。

Method: 引入主要任务损失监督、基于Fisher信息矩阵的正则化、特定任务正则化和碰撞感知正则化，构建DriftCaps诊断基准。

Result: AGL在关键安全基准上减轻高达50%的对齐漂移，不影响下游任务，各组件对保留潜在安全行为有独特贡献，推导并验证缩放定律。

Conclusion: AGL是对LoRA的结构性改进，能以最小的权衡确保对齐保留，已开源实现以促进进一步探索。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 所提基于LSTM的合流冲突预测方法优于基线方法，可提升大货车在施工区合流安全性。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Conclusion: 该工作开创激活稀疏新领域，为下一代AI系统设计提供基础见解。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习有重大威胁，需开发确保联邦学习环境安全的对策。

Method: 将联邦学习聚合过程建模为线性问题，转化为线性代数优化挑战，通过提取独立线性组合识别潜在攻击。

Result: 实验显示，FedLAD在不同恶意节点比例下比五种基线防御方法更有效，能保持低攻击成功率和高模型准确率。

Conclusion: FedLAD有潜力提升联邦学习系统面对数据投毒攻击时的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构 - 功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，弥合了结构预测和治疗发现之间的差距。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

TL;DR: 提出基于MLP、MSCNN和CA的轨迹预测模型，能在可接受推理时间内降低预测误差，实验结果优于对比模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹预测对制定前瞻性策略很重要，现有挑战包括轨迹数据中全局和局部时间信息复杂及用户行为时间尺度不同，需降低预测误差并控制推理时间。

Method: 提出基于MLP、MSCNN和CA的轨迹预测模型，MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息，CA融合二者。

Result: 与ModernTCN相比，在12步预测中，模型的均方误差（MSE）降低5.04%，平均绝对误差（MAE）降低4.35%，推理时间相近。

Conclusion: 所提出的轨迹预测模型能有效降低预测误差，同时保持可接受的推理时间。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人贷款平台优化信贷决策需反事实估计连续多维处理变量，但随机试验受限，现有因果方法难处理连续多维情况，且需保证处理 - 结果关系单调性。

Method: 提出Multi - Treatment - DML框架，利用双重机器学习去偏观测数据、处理多维连续处理变量并强制处理和结果间的单调约束。

Result: 在公共基准和真实工业数据集上实验有效，在真实个人贷款平台的A/B测试中展现实际优势。

Conclusion: Multi - Treatment - DML框架能有效解决个人贷款平台信贷决策优化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

TL;DR: 提出上下文感知自适应解码方法提升大语言模型真实性，在多个基准测试中表现良好，有跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提升大语言模型真实性的方法需大量标注数据和计算资源，解码策略存在问题，需轻量级方法。

Method: 提出上下文感知自适应解码方法，利用少量标注示例构建参考接地空间，推理时进行基于检索的对数概率调整。

Result: 在三个问答基准测试中平均提升2.8%，优于现有基线，有跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型无关、可扩展且高效的方法凸显了上下文感知解码对大语言模型事实可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Result: 广泛模拟表明，聚合响应比单个大语言模型的准确性更高，参与的大语言模型性能相近时提升更显著。

Conclusion: 利用小的专业语言模型聚合输出是提升大语言模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Conclusion: LeanK方法能在不牺牲精度的情况下减少GPU显存并加速解码，还可分析模型通道和注意力头。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务实验中，MPFT方法超体积性能优于基准，减少交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架有效，能提升MORL问题的求解效果。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Split Learning顺序更新过程易受单个恶意客户端影响，导致模型精度下降。

Method: 引入基于鸽巢原理的Pigeon - SL方案，将客户端分成N + 1个集群独立训练，选损失最低集群；用Pigeon - SL+在选定集群重复训练提升效率。

Result: 在三种攻击模型下验证了方法的鲁棒性和有效性，相比基线SL方法在精度和弹性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: Pigeon - SL和Pigeon - SL+方案能提高未来智能无线网络中模型的准确性和抗攻击能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: FAIR - Pruner是一种有效的神经网络结构化剪枝方法，能自动确定分层剪枝率，无需剪枝后微调，用户可灵活获得不同剪枝率的模型。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Result: 基于Transformer的生成器能保留94 - 97%的真实数据预测性能，同时保持对运营决策有信息价值的特征重要性模式；仅使用计划信息时，即使是真实数据预测准确性也有限。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可在保护商业机密性的同时，使更多人获得航空分析能力，但鉴于飞行运营的随机性，利益相关者需对战术前预测准确性保持现实期望。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Conclusion: CAPO是一种简单有效的方法，能实现更细粒度的信用分配，在多个基准测试中表现良好，可解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明NMS在模型准确率上优于当前SOTA方法DQ、DQAS和NeSSA。

Conclusion: NMS是首个能缓解泛化问题和降低DDR能耗的无DNN近内存采样技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法能从动力系统和压缩角度有效处理分类问题。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information

TL;DR: 提出MicroMix混合精度量化算法和矩阵乘法内核，适配Blackwell架构，在多任务中表现出色，执行速度和内存效率优于TensorRT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INT4内核无法充分利用NVIDIA Blackwell架构新FP4 Tensor Cores能力，需设计新算法和内核。

Method: 提出基于Microscaling (MX)数据格式的MicroMix算法和内核，支持MXFP4、MXFP6、MXFP8通道组合，引入量化阈值平衡精度和效率。

Result: 在多种下游任务中表现有竞争力或更优，在消费级和服务器级GPU上执行速度比TensorRT - FP8快至少20%，应用于多种模型时改善预填充延迟和内存效率。

Conclusion: MicroMix算法和内核在性能和效率上表现良好，代码开源。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

*Moritz Piening,Robert Beinert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的Gromov - Wasserstein (GW)及其融合扩展(FGW)切片技术，降低计算负担，有诸多优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原GW和FGW计算有挑战，切片版本受限，需新方法克服问题。

Method: 基于合适下界、分层OT和1D OT问题的求积规则提出新切片技术。

Result: 新的切片FGW减少数值计算量，保持等距变换不变性，可比较任意几何形状，定义伪度量，数值更稳健可靠。

Conclusion: 新切片距离在形状检索和图同构测试等场景比原GW和FGW更优。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

TL;DR: 提出针对大语言模型的PPF剪枝框架，消除手动设计依赖，支持动态和静态剪枝，实验表明其性能优于现有方法且能大幅加速评估过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非均匀结构化网络剪枝方法依赖手动设计策略，无法适应动态剪枝比例需求，且评估策略耗时，限制了寻找最优策略的可行性。

Method: 提出PPF框架，利用代理产生自适应实时剪枝动作，使用轻量级性能预测器在几秒内评估剪枝策略。

Result: 在Llama2 - 7B和Llama3 - 8B上实验，PPF可生成动态/静态剪枝策略，降低困惑度，性能预测器实现高精度秒级预测，评估延迟从分钟级降至秒级，加速超64倍。

Conclusion: PPF框架有效解决现有剪枝方法的局限性，在动态和静态剪枝场景均表现出色，优于手动设计的剪枝策略。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

Motivation: 现有对称损失函数因对称条件过严存在欠拟合问题，需缓解标签噪声。

Result: 实验表明该方法在缓解合成和真实世界标签噪声方面表现优越。

Conclusion: ε-softmax方法简单有效，结合对称损失能更好地平衡鲁棒性和有效学习。

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Result: 实验展示了ASMR在组织病理学数据集的图像分类任务中的检测能力，也呈现了动态调整决策边界的重要性的相关发现。

Conclusion: ASMR方法能有效应对联邦学习中故障客户端问题，且无需超参数和故障客户端数量的知识，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Conclusion: ML分类器可作为3D器官形状生成中的轻量级、与任务相关的质量指标，支持医学形状建模中更透明和临床一致的评估协议。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Conclusion: 提出的临床专家不确定性感知基准和标签平滑方法能有效解决医学图像分析中的标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Conclusion: JacobiNet能有效解决PINNs处理不规则边界的问题，具有泛化性、准确性和高效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

Conclusion: 该视角转变了对Transformer注意力机制的理解，为架构设计和与注意力汇聚的关系提供了新见解。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

Conclusion: XAI方法需要特定领域的适配和验证，之前神经影像研究的解释需重新评估，为XAI在神经影像中的实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法能增强决策可解释性，在特征选择上有优势。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

TL;DR: 提出自适应黎曼图神经网络(ARGNN)框架，可学习图上连续各向异性黎曼度量张量场，在基准数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何图神经网络难以捕捉图数据复杂的几何异质性。

Method: 引入ARGNN框架，对节点度量张量进行有效参数化，采用受Ricci流启发的正则化确保几何规则性和稳定训练。

Result: 理论上为ARGNN建立严格的几何演化收敛保证，提供连续泛化统一先前的固定或混合曲率GNN；实证上在同质性和异质性基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: ARGNN能自适应捕捉图的多样结构，学习到的几何为图结构提供可解释见解并验证理论分析。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在专业领域表格数据应用中因数据稀缺受限，传统生成模型在低数据场景表现不佳，大语言模型忽略表格数据依赖结构的问题。

Method: 引入StructSynth框架，采用两阶段架构，先进行结构发现学习有向无环图，再用该结构引导大语言模型生成数据。

Result: StructSynth生成的合成数据在结构完整性和下游实用性上显著优于现有方法，在低数据场景效果尤其好。

Conclusion: StructSynth能有效解决表格数据生成问题，平衡隐私保护和统计保真度。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长程预测中存在可解释性和噪声、动态不确定性下的稳定性问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出DeepKoopFormer框架，采用模块化的编码器 - 传播器 - 解码器结构，在潜在空间通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子学习时间动态，并施加结构保证。

Result: 在合成动力系统、气候、金融和电力数据集上，DeepKoopFormer在准确性、抗噪性和长期预测稳定性方面优于标准LSTM和基线Transformer模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是高维动态环境下灵活、可解释且稳健的预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Result: 学习到的卷积核有对角结构，能根据输入特征产生音乐效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练有从少量数据中发现音频转换的潜力，可用于新的效果设计。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Conclusion: LOST方法能在效率约束下有效训练大语言模型，具有应用价值。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Abstract: Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to
present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission,
storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a
substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our
choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial
neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply
evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by
power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved
critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation
of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image
classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task
achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The
result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the
performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover, the proposed
critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due to its
robustness to extreme initial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在异构设备上部署时，现有推理性能预测方法硬件特定且缺乏泛化性，需新方法。

Method: 引入LIFE框架，含模块化算子分析模型，可硬件和数据集无关地表征推理工作负载，考虑软件和模型优化影响。

Result: 用AMD和NVIDIA等硬件及Llama2 - 7B变体验证，LIFE能通过系统效率视角预测性能。

Conclusion: LIFE可实现不同硬件平台上大语言模型的高效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents
on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting
inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging
due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU
benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often
hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a
lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular
analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference
workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the
influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache
compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator
fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT),
time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables
performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and
memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate
LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA
V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in
forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable
efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的回归测试自动化生成方法存在程序执行推理能力有限、覆盖率增长停滞的问题。

Method: TestWeaver引入三个创新点：用目标行的反向切片替代完整程序上下文；识别并纳入与目标行路径有控制流相似性的近邻测试用例；用执行内联注释增强LLM推理。

Result: TestWeaver加速了代码覆盖率增长，生成的回归测试用例比现有基于LLM的方法更有效。

Conclusion: TestWeaver通过提供有针对性和上下文的输入，改善了覆盖率引导的测试生成，减少了冗余探索。

Abstract: Regression testing ensures that code changes do not unintentionally break
existing functionality. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they
often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in
stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this
paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates
lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.
TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and
improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target
line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close
test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the
target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and
(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode
variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these
targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test
generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate
that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective
regression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: 	ool能发现传统工具遗漏的响应性问题，提高性能调试效率。

Abstract: GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile
applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead
to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived
delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that
evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions.
Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful,
may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively.
  In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box
technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts --
video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user
interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance
issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user
interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key
metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish
time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually
annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool
achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures
response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for
over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing
pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness
issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging
efficiency.

Conclusion: 该框架在识别语义克隆方面有效，未来将探索跨语言克隆检测和优化框架用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at
identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software
systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,
particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement
identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code
semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields
suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines
LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic
clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to
filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not
identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation
approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence
through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct
LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying
semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection
and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously
integrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing
reliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is
important to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential
for sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to
understand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to
equilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature
request, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of
contributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue
resolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to
provide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical
foundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this
paper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by
experimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest
that (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more
feasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)
improved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with
ascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves
the overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical
dataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align
stability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the
viability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide
concrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.

Conclusion: 可持续的工具采用需要转向采用导向设计，对自动化软件工程工具有实际指导意义。

Abstract: System tracing has become essential for understanding complex software
behavior in modern systems, yet sophisticated trace analysis tools face
significant adoption gaps in industrial settings. Through a year-long
collaboration with Ericsson Montr\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine
Learning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to
trace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation
needs, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into
actionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting
automated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the
Excellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when
conflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL
addresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in
interfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental
adoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's
integration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed
consistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and
trust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer
semi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative
feedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results
validate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise,
and transparency-based trust. This challenges conventional capability-focused
tool development, demonstrating that sustainable adoption requires
reorientation toward adoption-focused design with actionable implications for
automated software engineering tools.

Conclusion: 全面上下文集成对有效元提示至关重要，三大主要LLM均可作为有效元提示器，为工业从业者提供可行见解。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,

*Lukas Kirschner,Ezekiel Soremekun*

TL;DR: 提出自动测试生成方法FdLoop，通过学习输入属性生成特定目标输入，在多数情况下优于基线方法，能有效实现单一及多测试目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试生成器大多未针对特定目标，基于语法的测试生成器实现任意测试目标的概率低，需解决生成特定目标输入的问题。

Method: 提出FdLoop方法，通过测试反馈和概率语法迭代选择、演化和学习特定目标测试输入的分布，针对四个测试目标实现该方法。

Result: 在86%的设置中，FdLoop优于五个测试基线；在诱导错误行为方面，比最佳基线EvoGFuzz有效达2倍；各组件对其有效性有积极贡献。

Conclusion: FdLoop能有效实现单一测试目标，且可扩展到不同参数设置下的多测试目标。

Abstract: To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate
goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal.
However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target
specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly)
produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar)
have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work
addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach
(called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from
existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a
testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input
distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic
grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code
coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long
execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats
(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,
FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based
test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),
EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best
baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that
the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test
feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation
demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing
erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution
time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源软件生产自动化普及，需了解GitHub Marketplace趋势、特征和动态，且学术研究与行业实践存在脱节。

Method: 对GitHub Marketplace进行系统分析，对比行业工具趋势和学术文献进展。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: GitHub, a central hub for collaborative software development, has
revolutionized the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem through its GitHub
Marketplace, a platform launched in 2017 to host automation tools aimed at
enhancing the efficiency and scalability of software projects. As the adoption
of automation in OSS production grows, understanding the trends,

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文基于Wonderless数据集方法创建OpenLambdaVerse数据集，分析使用Serverless框架和AWS Lambda函数的GitHub仓库，为从业者和研究者提供无服务器工作负载的最新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无服务器计算生态系统快速发展，需要对相关工具在实际项目中的使用情况有最新的了解。

Method: 基于Wonderless数据集的方法，应用多个新的过滤步骤，创建使用Serverless框架和包含一个或多个AWS Lambda函数应用的GitHub仓库数据集，并进行分析。

Result: 通过分析数据集，了解当前应用的规模、复杂性、使用的语言和运行时、函数触发方式、项目成熟度和安全实践等情况。

Conclusion: OpenLambdaVerse为从业者和研究者提供了有价值的最新资源，有助于更好地理解不断发展的无服务器工作负载。

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is at the core of serverless computing, enabling
developers to easily deploy applications without managing computing resources.
With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless
Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows,
and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction
development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for
updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building
on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless
computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse
addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that
use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS
Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an
understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this
stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and
complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ,
how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their
security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable,
up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better
understand evolving serverless workloads.

TL;DR: 研究使用大语言模型进行代码修改，对比两种提示策略，发现开发者采用迭代工作流，策略各有优劣，需更易用的提示交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型用于代码生成研究多，但代码修改研究少，构建有效代码修改提示存在挑战。

Method: 研究两种提示策略（直接指令提示和摘要介导提示），让15名开发者在多场景下完成修改任务。

Result: 开发者采用迭代工作流，两种策略各有优劣，策略选择受任务目标和上下文影响。

Conclusion: 需要更易用的提示交互，如可调整摘要粒度、可靠的摘要 - 代码可追溯性等。

Abstract: This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in
modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely
studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although
"prompting" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate
intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification
introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that
natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches
have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study
investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:
Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in
free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by
editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study
with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques
across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an
iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating
outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy
presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier
to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt
scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task
goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and
code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt
interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code
traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.

Motivation: 解决软件工程大模型训练中基础设施昂贵、评估管道低效、训练数据稀缺和质量控制成本高等瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出RepoForge管道，结合存储高效沙箱、Ray分布式评估、自动数据生成、SPICE标签和无气泡RL支架等技术。

Result: RepoForge - 8B - Agent在SWE - Bench - Verified取得17.4%成绩；自动生成7304个执行环境；实现14倍存储减少；评估速度提升超70%；标签成本降低19000倍。

Conclusion: RepoForge解决了软件工程大模型训练的关键瓶颈，即使≤8B模型也能在基准测试达到新SOTA。

Abstract: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive
infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and
costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end
pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key
contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on
SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new
state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable
environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual
intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per
instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\%
faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge
harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated
SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying
storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data
generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate
that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on
demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical
bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based
evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of
high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL
pipeline bottlenecks.

TL;DR: 提出CG - FSPTA解决基于控制流图的流敏感指针分析效率低的问题，实验证明其能在保持精度的同时提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于控制流图的流敏感指针分析方法在解决指向信息时因控制流图结构复杂而效率低。

Method: 提出基于流敏感约束图（FSConsG）的流敏感指针分析方法CG - FSPTA，利用集合约束图结构优势并保持流敏感性，结合图优化和动态求解技术。

Result: 在基准程序实验中，CG - FSPTA平均减少33.05%内存使用，比现有方法加速7.27倍，且保持精度。

Conclusion: CG - FSPTA是分析大型软件系统的可扩展解决方案，为高效程序分析框架发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise
program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating
control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias
analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc.
Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based
on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer
analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information.
However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when
resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of
control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph
(FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of
control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to
leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly
used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity
of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated
graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA
achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of
flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs
demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and
execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the
FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and
accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the
state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of
CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems,
establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program
analysis frameworks.

TL;DR: Python第三方库升级有兼容性问题，现有工具不足，提出PCREQ方法自动推断兼容需求，评估显示效果好，提升自动化程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python第三方库升级存在版本和代码兼容性问题，现有工具无法完全自动化推断兼容版本，需填补此空白。

Method: 提出PCREQ方法，集成六个模块，通过收集候选版本、检查冲突、识别API使用等步骤生成兼容的requirements.txt和详细修复报告。

Result: 构建REQBench评估，PCREQ推断成功率达94.03%，优于其他方法，平均处理时间60.79s。

Conclusion: PCREQ显著减少升级故障排除的人工工作量，推动Python依赖维护自动化。

Abstract: Python third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential in modern software
development, but upgrades often cause compatibility issues, leading to system
failures. These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues
(VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect
dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no
solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs
and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to
automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code
compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition,
version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code
compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ
collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage,
evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a
compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ,
we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases
(including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03%
inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and
LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each
case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency.
PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades,
advancing Python dependency maintenance automation.

we proposed BiFuzz, a two-stage fuzzer designed for automated testing of
open-world video games, and investigated its effectiveness. The results
revealed that BiFuzz mutated the overall strategy of gameplay and test cases,
including actual movement paths, step by step. Consequently, BiFuzz can detect
`stucking' failures. The tool and its video are at

TL;DR: 本文提出可有效管理和优化粗粒度可重构阵列（CGRA）编译时的控制流的方法，框架比现有方法提速达2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CGRA编译器大多处理应用程序数据流，对控制流支持不足，限制其广泛应用，需解决控制流管理和优化问题。

Method: 提出模块化编译框架，包含转换和优化过程，支持任意控制流应用；引入新映射方法作为编译后端，解决硬件资源限制问题。

Result: 框架通过编译优化，相比现有方法实现了高达2.1倍的加速。

Conclusion: 控制流可在编译层面有效管理和优化，能以硬件无关方式实现高性能，适用于广泛应用。

Abstract: Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility
and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive
workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is
posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space
spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art
compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of
applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they
mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of
control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.
  Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively
managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of
applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high
performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework
consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for
applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We
also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end,
addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and
guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework
achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through
compilation optimizations.

Motivation: 传统测试方法与HIDEs工具脱节，执行粒度粗且缺乏运行时上下文，破坏开发流程。

Method: 开发提供测试运行时表示的库，实现与HIDEs紧密集成。

Result: 实现了与HIDEs的紧密集成，能在测试失败时立即访问HIDE工具，达到亚秒级测试重执行时间。

Conclusion: 该库及增强测试的工作流有助于保持开发者的专注度。

Abstract: Highly interactive development environments (HIDEs) enable uninterrupted
development flow through continuous program evolution and rapid hypothesis
checking. However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed
separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers,
value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse
execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks
development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we
present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing
tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in
the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced
with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times
crucial for maintaining developer focus.

Result: 揭示了15种方法论方法、9种主要威胁和25种缓解策略，提出PRIMES 2.0框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于LLM的MSR研究建立了更透明和可重复的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering
research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks.
However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of
LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood.
Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance
benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across
the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method
study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of
LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the
empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15
methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies.
Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical
framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps,
each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies,
providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类行为不可预测，AMR可能未接受过应对所有未知和不确定行为的训练，且在真实环境中测试AMR成本高、不实际且有潜在危险，因此需有效测试方法确保AMR安全行为。

Method: 提出基于VLM的测试方法RVSG，根据功能和安全需求，利用VLM生成违反这些需求的多样人类行为。

Result: 在模拟器中评估显示，与基线相比，RVSG能有效生成违反需求的场景，且增加机器人行为变异性。

Conclusion: RVSG是一种有效的工业AMR测试方法，有助于揭示机器人的不确定行为。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g.,
warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans.
Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been
trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important
to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe
behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is
often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in
human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based
testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain.
Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate
diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with
several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR
from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can
effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated
scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their
uncertain behaviors.

Motivation: 第三方库复用管理混乱带来维护和伦理问题，Java缺少专门的克隆式软件成分分析工具，直接应用其他工具技术存在问题。

Method: 开发JC - Finder，通过捕获类级别特征、维护函数间关系和排除琐碎或重复元素，识别Java项目中通过代码克隆引入的第三方库复用。

Result: 应用JC - Finder到9965个流行Maven库和1000个GitHub项目，F1分数0.818，解决复用平均用时14.2秒；应用到7947个GitHub项目，发现789个项目存在复用，共识别2142个库，能多检测26.20%未声明库。

Conclusion: JC - Finder在识别Java项目中第三方库复用方面准确且高效，能检测到未声明的库。

Abstract: While reusing third-party libraries (TPL) facilitates software development,
its chaotic management has brought great threats to software maintenance and
the unauthorized use of source code also raises ethical problems such as
misconduct on copyrighted code. To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software
Composition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques
are used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and
package-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones
is prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.
Also, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is
problematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA
tool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL
reuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves
both accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by
capturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function
relationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the
efficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as
reference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result
shows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other
function-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is
14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We
further applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code
clones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of
2,142 TPLs. JC-Finder successfully detects 26.20% more TPLs that are not
explicitly declared in package managers.

TL;DR: 本文用QML为PAL Robotics的自主移动机器人开发测试预言机，提出QuReBot框架，结果显示QuReBot收敛且比经典神经网络基线降低15%预测误差，还给出最佳配置建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人软件升级需回归测试，但确定机器人预期正确行为（测试预言机）因未知环境而具挑战性，ML测试预言是可行方案。

Method: 提出结合量子储层计算（QRC）和简单神经网络的混合框架QuReBot来预测机器人预期行为。

Result: QRC单独使用不收敛、预测误差高，QuReBot收敛且比经典神经网络基线降低15%预测误差。

Conclusion: 进一步研究不同配置下的QuReBot，为未来机器人软件测试提供最佳设置的实用指导。

Abstract: Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with
both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such
robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix
bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of
robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct
behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially
unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this
challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.
This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression
testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using
quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the
construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid
framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a
simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected
behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,
yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%
reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network
baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations
and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot
software testing.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级、模型无关的用语言模型对静态补全排序的新评分方法，可将语言模型集成到 IDE 现有工具中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码补全系统在捕捉上下文信息和跨项目及编码风格泛化方面有待提升，补全排序影响其有用性。

Method: 将所有有效补全组织成前缀树，进行一次贪心解码收集树中标记级分数，实现精确标记感知排序。

Result: 该方法快速、与架构无关，且与已部署的代码补全模型兼容。

Conclusion: 为将语言模型集成到 IDE 现有工具提供了实用有效的途径，能提供更智能响应的开发者辅助。

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

Motivation: 现有将自然语言指令转化为代码编辑的解决方案有依赖人工指令输入、延迟高的局限，阻碍融入开发工作流，而开发者历史编辑模式可解决此问题。

Method: 提出NES框架，采用双模型架构，用高质量SFT和DAPO数据集训练，优化推理以降低延迟。

Result: NES在预测下一编辑位置的两个任务中准确率分别达75.6%和81.6%，意图对齐编辑的ES为91.36%、EMR为27.7%，开源数据集可提升开源CodeLLMs性能。

Conclusion: NES是可扩展、适用于行业的解决方案，能提升开发者工作效率。

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

TL;DR: 研究开源软件项目弹性，基于CSI框架验证提交频率模式，发现不同时间尺度稳定性情况及稳定项目示例，提出拓宽弹性评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织对开源软件依赖增加，现有指标对项目弹性研究不足，需理解项目弹性。

Method: 基于Composite Stability Index (CSI)框架，对100个高排名仓库的提交频率模式进行实证验证。

Result: 仅2%仓库有每日稳定性，29%实现每周稳定，50%有每月稳定，一半仓库各时间尺度都不稳定；编程语言和区块链应用最稳定；找到两个各粒度都稳定的仓库；大的年度提交量不一定与稳定性相关。

Conclusion: 可结合问题解决时间、PR合并率和社区参与度指标拓宽弹性评估和基于稳定性的风险评估。

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value
and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As
organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is
critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one
dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to
normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security
vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit
patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance,
sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable
resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we
empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked
repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily
stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly
stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming
languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two
exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities,
whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as
reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not
necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched
with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics
to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.

Motivation: 了解LLM在开源技术文档翻译中的需求和潜力，因开源社区文档多为英文且LLM在该领域能力未知。

Method: 评估社区翻译活动，用ChatGPT 4和Claude对50个README文件进行英德翻译。

Result: 社区翻译活动少，主要在大型仓库；LLM能提供准确翻译，但存在保真挑战，如结构组件保存和格式不一致。

Conclusion: LLM辅助文档国际化有前景也有挑战，TRIFID框架为自动化支持开源文档奠定基础。

Abstract: While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few
repositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is
known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical
documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown
formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical
documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and
English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and
Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger
repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison
suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed
fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components
(e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings
highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation
internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous
integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity
scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve
code, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated
LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We propose the Financial Connectome, a new scientific discipline that models
financial markets through the lens of brain functional architecture. Inspired
by the foundational work of group independent component analysis (groupICA) in
neuroscience, we reimagine markets not as collections of assets, but as
high-dimensional dynamic systems composed of latent market modules. Treating
stocks as functional nodes and their co-fluctuations as expressions of
collective cognition, we introduce dynamic Market Network Connectivity (dMNC),
the financial analogue of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC). This
biologically inspired framework reveals structurally persistent market
subnetworks, captures regime shifts, and uncovers systemic early warning
signals all without reliance on predictive labels. Our results suggest that
markets, like brains, exhibit modular, self-organizing, and temporally evolving
architectures. This work inaugurates the field of financial connectomics, a
principled synthesis of systems neuroscience and quantitative finance aimed at
uncovering the hidden logic of complex economies.

Conclusion: 直接从字节空间学习是建模复杂金融系统的有前景且灵活的范式，可避免分词偏差。

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a
critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust
market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often
constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern
deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that
affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through
discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,
a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB
events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte
prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed
binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core
novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and
tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most
fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,
a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to
discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.
Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework
for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a
comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million
events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized
facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,
heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that
learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm
for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on
standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study
properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in
quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis
tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main
tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be
recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol
{\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine
arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to
demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the
matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity)
yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation.
In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a
measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately
defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also
consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary
solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the
confusion matrix.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to
accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural
networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from
the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic
neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a
validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations.
We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in
particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is
essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence
intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and
achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques.
Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform
to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.

Result: 实现了在非可分模型中的反事实推断，准确恢复了潜在结果函数。

Conclusion: 提出的Flow IV方法有助于解决识别因果关系和反事实推理的难题。

Abstract: To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate
causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual
reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this
task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for
mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects.
While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the
population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically
assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under
standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in
treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the
treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed
data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We
implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the
likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the
underlying outcome function. We call our method Flow IV.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite
imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level
wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can
be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training
objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently
suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of
causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing
debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this
attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the
downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in
data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction
methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that
substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled
data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear
transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's
correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address
shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's
learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using
Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods
meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to
training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may
represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference
when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a "one map,
many trials" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces
predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用中计算机实验运行成本高，现有黑盒方法 'pick - the - winner' 在高维空间优化性能差。

Method: 提出基于边际均值函数估计全局优化器的 BOMM 方法，用变换加性高斯过程代理模型实现。

Result: 证明 BOMM 估计器优化的一致性，缓和维数灾难，在数值实验和中微子探测器优化应用中有效。

Conclusion: BOMM 方法能在高维空间实现更好的优化性能。

Abstract: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly
used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,
the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require
hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over
a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs
$\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated
inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''
(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address
this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)
approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$
that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently
inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can
select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.
Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with
unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM
estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization
rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,
thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a
practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive
Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector
optimization in nuclear physics.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效加速低维高斯过程推理，代码可在指定链接获取。

Abstract: To speed up Gaussian process inference, a number of fast kernel matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM) approximation algorithms have been proposed over the
years. In this paper, we establish an exact fast kernel MVM algorithm based on
exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution
functions, compatible with a class of kernels which includes multivariate
Mat\'ern kernels with half-integer smoothness parameter. This algorithm uses a
divide-and-conquer approach, during which sorting outputs are stored in a data
structure. We also propose a new algorithm to take into account some linear
fixed effects predictor function. Our numerical experiments confirm that our
algorithm is very effective for low-dimensional Gaussian process inference
problems with hundreds of thousands of data points. An implementation of our
algorithm is available at

Conclusion: 考虑学习表征空间和原始协变量特征空间的相关性可解决分布平衡和信息损失的权衡问题，SMRL算法有效。

Abstract: Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest
from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment
effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation
learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by
introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the
baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high
dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers
to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the
proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation
error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information
loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space
and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with
simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure
Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic
health record data from the MIMIC-III database.

Result: 明确了方法的效率权衡以及采用基于学习方法带来的计算成本。

Conclusion: 讨论了不同方法在不同用例下的优势。

Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the
development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for
addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of
determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In
large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of
tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In
this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from
the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to
perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative
approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We
highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs
that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the
advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

Result: 通过物理科学中的多个案例研究，证明了FreB方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FreB能在直接似然评估不可行或成本过高的领域提供有效性保证和可解释诊断，实现可信的科学推理。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data
structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples.
Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models
to ``inverse problems'' to infer hidden parameters from observed data. While
these methods can handle intractable models and large-scale studies, they can
also produce biased or overconfident conclusions. We present a solution with
Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes
AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that
consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while
achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate
FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences:
identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing
theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in
observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable
diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where
direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.

Result: 开发出riemtan和riemstats两个R包。

Conclusion: 两个包的模块化设计便于与现有R工作流集成，为流形值数据分析的未来方法发展提供可扩展框架。

Abstract: Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices arising from functional
connectivity analysis of neuroimaging data can be endowed with a Riemannian
geometric structure that standard methods fail to respect. While existing R
packages provide some tools for SPD matrix analysis, they suffer from
limitations in scalability, numerical stability, and metric flexibility that
hinder their application to modern large-scale connectomics studies. We present
riemtan, a comprehensive R package that addresses these challenges through a
unified, high-level interface supporting multiple Riemannian metrics, efficient
parallel computation, and seamless conversion between manifold, tangent, and
vectorized representations. Building on riemtan's foundation, we also introduce
riemstats, which implements advanced statistical methods including Fr\'echet
ANOVA, Riemannian ANOVA with classic test statistics, and harmonization
techniques for multi-site studies. The modular design facilitates integration
with existing R workflows and provides an extensible framework for future
methodological developments in manifold-valued data analysis.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a self-supervised scan-specific deep learning framework
for reconstructing accelerated multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI).
  Methods: We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural
representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural
representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that
incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative
learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric
quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled
optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational
efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes
rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated
multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous
estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton
fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain
data.
  Results: Under 4x and 5x accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved
superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized
root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to
baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning
approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference
values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction
efficiency by approximately fivefold.
  Conclusion: REFINE-MORE enables accurate and efficient scan-specific
multiparametric qMRI reconstruction, providing a flexible solution for
high-dimensional, accelerated qMRI applications.

Conclusion: 提出的从平滑经验分布生成提议的方法可有效解决粒子耗尽问题，适用于递归贝叶斯推理。

Abstract: Recursive Bayesian inference, in which posterior beliefs are updated in light
of accumulating data, is a tool for implementing Bayesian models in
applications with streaming and/or very large data sets. As the posterior of
one iteration becomes the prior for the next, beliefs are updated sequentially
instead of all-at-once. Thus, recursive inference is relevant for both
streaming data and settings where data too numerous to be analyzed together can
be partitioned into manageable pieces. In practice, posteriors are
characterized by samples obtained using, e.g., acceptance/rejection sampling in
which draws from the posterior of one iteration are used as proposals for the
next. While simple to implement, such filtering approaches suffer from particle
depletion, degrading each sample's ability to represent its target posterior.
As a remedy, we investigate generating proposals from a smoothed version of the
preceding sample's empirical distribution. The method retains computationally
valuable properties of similar methods, but without particle depletion, and we
demonstrate its accuracy in simulation. We apply the method to data simulated
from both a simple, logistic regression model as well as a hierarchical model
originally developed for classifying forest vegetation in New Mexico using
satellite imagery.

Abstract: Aleatoric and Epistemic uncertainty have achieved recent attention in the
literature as different sources from which uncertainty can emerge in stochastic
modeling. Epistemic being intrinsic or model based notions of uncertainty, and
aleatoric being the uncertainty inherent in the data. We propose a novel
decision theoretic framework for outlier detection in the context of aleatoric
uncertainty; in the context of Bayesian modeling. The model incorporates
bayesian false discovery rate control for multiplicty adjustment, and a new
generalization of Bayesian FDR is introduced. The model is applied to
simulations based on temporally fluctuating outlier detection where fixing
thresholds often results in poor performance due to nonstationarity, and a case
study is outlined on on a novel cybersecurity detection. Cyberthreat signals
are highly nonstationary; giving a credible stress test of the model.

Abstract: Machine learning has revitalized causal inference by combining flexible
models and principled estimators, yet robust benchmarking and evaluation remain
challenging with real-world data. In this work, we introduce frengression, a
deep generative realization of the frugal parameterization that models the
joint distribution of covariates, treatments and outcomes around the causal
margin of interest. Frengression provides accurate estimation and flexible,
faithful simulation of multivariate, time-varying data; it also enables direct
sampling from user-specified interventional distributions. Model consistency
and extrapolation guarantees are established, with validation on real-world
clinical trial data demonstrating frengression's practical utility. We envision
this framework sparking new research into generative approaches for causal
margin modelling.

Abstract: In classical density (or density-functional) estimation, it is standard to
assume that the underlying distribution has a density with respect to the
Lebesgue measure. However, when the data distribution is a mixture of
continuous and discrete components, the resulting methods are inconsistent in
theory and perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we point out that a minor
modification of existing methods for nonparametric density (functional)
estimation can allow us to fully remove this assumption while retaining nearly
identical theoretical guarantees and improved empirical performance. Our
approach is very simple: data points that appear exactly once are likely to
originate from the continuous component, whereas repeated observations are
indicative of the discrete part. Leveraging this observation, we modify
existing estimators for a broad class of functionals of the continuous
component of the mixture; this modification is a "wrapper" in the sense that
the user can use any underlying method of their choice for continuous density
functional estimation. Our modifications deliver consistency without requiring
knowledge of the discrete support, the mixing proportion, and without imposing
additional assumptions beyond those needed in the absence of the discrete part.
Thus, various theorems and existing software packages can be made automatically
more robust, with absolutely no additional price when the data is not truly
mixed.

Conclusion: 此方法让不确定性可视化对从业者更易获取，可作为教学工具

Abstract: Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is
often hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and
representing uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a
general approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the
statistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of
first calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method
propagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling
from the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for
each sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are
aggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is
versatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create
the basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees
for standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a
reference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's
utility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty
visualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly
extends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and
tables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to
practitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.

Abstract: Advanced bioimaging technologies have enabled the large-scale acquisition of
multidimensional data, yet effective metadata management and interoperability
remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose a new
ontology-driven framework for the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics
Database (SSBD) that adopts a two-tier architecture. The core layer provides a
class-centric structure referencing existing biomedical ontologies, supporting
both SSBD:repository -- which focuses on rapid dataset publication with minimal
metadata -- and SSBD:database, which is enhanced with biological and
imaging-related annotations. Meanwhile, the instance layer represents actual
imaging dataset information as Resource Description Framework individuals that
are explicitly linked to the core classes. This layered approach aligns
flexible instance data with robust ontological classes, enabling seamless
integration and advanced semantic queries. By coupling flexibility with rigor,
the SSBD Ontology promotes interoperability, data reuse, and the discovery of
novel biological mechanisms. Moreover, our solution aligns with the Recommended
Metadata for Biological Images guidelines and fosters compatibility.
Ultimately, our approach contributes to establishing a Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable data ecosystem within the bioimaging community.

### [393] [The Attribution Crisis in LLM Search Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00838)
*Ilan Strauss,Jangho Yang,Tim O'Reilly,Sruly Rosenblat,Isobel Moure*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 分析搜索增强大模型存在的引用差距问题，给出利用模式、结果并提出建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络大模型回答查询时不标注引用网页来源的引用差距问题。

Method: 分析约14000条真实世界LMArena对话日志，采用负二项式障碍模型。

Result: 发现三种利用模式，不同模型引用效率差异大，GPT - 4o引用差距小可能是日志披露问题。

Conclusion: 推荐基于标准化遥测和搜索痕迹、引用日志完全披露的透明大模型搜索架构。

Abstract: Web-enabled LLMs frequently answer queries without crediting the web pages
they consume, creating an "attribution gap" - the difference between relevant
URLs read and those actually cited. Drawing on approximately 14,000 real-world
LMArena conversation logs with search-enabled LLM systems, we document three
exploitation patterns: 1) No Search: 34% of Google Gemini and 24% of OpenAI
GPT-4o responses are generated without explicitly fetching any online content;
2) No citation: Gemini provides no clickable citation source in 92% of answers;
3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant
pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model
shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3
relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained
by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation
efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited
- varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries,
underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem
impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on
standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 本文在信息科学背景下重新审视专利，分析新技术对专利相关传统概念的挑战，指出组织信息等方面的重要性，呼吁以协作、透明和道德的方式管理专利知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在技术快速变革时代，将专利置于信息科学背景下重新审视，探讨新技术对专利传统概念的挑战。

Method: 聚焦人工智能发明、生物技术专利和国际专利竞争三个领域进行分析。

Result: 确定了组织信息、创建原创性元数据标准、实施检索系统和进行道德思考的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在专利环境中以协作、透明和道德的方式管理知识，强调信息专业人员和政策对创新公平获取的作用。

Abstract: In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into not
only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage
containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation.
This chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science,
by focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as
fundamentally tied to the global movement of scientific and technological
knowledge. With a focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents,
and international competition with patents, this work considers how new
technologies are challenging traditional notions of inventorship, access, and
moral accountability.The chapter provides a critical analysis of AI's
implications for patent authorship and prior art searches, ownership issues
arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology to ethical dilemmas, and the
problem of using patents for strategic advantage in a global context of
innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified the importance
of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality,
implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical
contemplation about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems.
Ultimately, the chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and
ethically-based approach in managing knowledge in the patenting environment
highlighting the role for information professionals and policy to contribute to
access equity in innovation.

TL;DR: 提出用于多模态实体链接任务的框架Intra - and Inter - modal Collaborative Reflections，通过多轮迭代策略提升匹配精度，在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多模态实体链接方法存在在某些场景下不必要纳入图像数据和仅一次性提取视觉特征的问题，影响有效性和准确性。

Method: 提出Intra - and Inter - modal Collaborative Reflections框架，优先利用文本信息，文本不足时采用多轮迭代策略整合图像关键视觉线索。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公开数据集上，框架始终优于当前最先进方法，分别实现3.2%、5.1%和1.6%的提升。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决现有方法问题，提升多模态实体链接任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/I2CR/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对Ad - hoc Video Search（AVS）任务提出LPD方法，通过构建特定特征公共空间和去相关损失，设计熵基公平多空间三元组排序损失，实验证明其有效性和提升结果多样性的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVS任务的主要挑战是相关视频的视觉多样性，当前解决方案忽视了多样化空间的需求，为充分利用单个特征的表达能力，提出LPD方法。

Method: 提出LPD方法，包括为每个视频和文本特征学习单独的公共空间，采用去相关损失使不同空间中负样本排序多样化，设计熵基公平多空间三元组排序损失增强多空间收敛的一致性。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS基准（2016 - 2023）上的大量实验证明了LPD的有效性，其空间的多样性可视化突出了增强结果多样性的能力。

Conclusion: LPD方法在AVS任务中是有效的，能够提升结果的多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

TL;DR: 提出Uni - Layout框架实现布局统一生成、类人评估及二者对齐，实验表现优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局生成方法有任务特定性和评估指标感知不一致问题，适用性受限且测量无效。

Method: 将布局任务纳入单一分类法开发统一生成器；构建含100,000个标注布局的数据集Layout - HF100k，引入类人评估器；采用DMPO整合生成器和评估器。

Result: Uni - Layout显著优于任务特定和通用方法。

Conclusion: Uni - Layout框架有效，代码公开。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Motivation: 现有时间动作定位方法存在领域偏差和部署效率低的问题，近期零样本时间动作定位工作有粗粒度估计和开环管道的局限，阻碍了时间交互定位性能提升。

Method: 提出EgoLoc方法，引入自适应采样策略生成视觉提示用于大视觉语言模型推理，结合2D和3D观测，根据3D手速在可能的交互时间戳附近采样初始猜测，还生成闭环反馈来细化定位结果。

Result: 在公开数据集和新提出的基准上的综合实验表明，EgoLoc在第一人称视频的时间交互定位上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EgoLoc能更好地实现第一人称视频的时间交互定位，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep

TL;DR: 提出HoneyImage方法用于图像识别模型数据集所有权验证，实验表明效果好且对下游性能影响小，能保护数据所有权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像数据集含敏感或专有内容，现有验证方案在验证效果和数据完整性间有固有权衡，需可靠机制验证数据是否被第三方模型滥用。

Method: 提出HoneyImage方法，选择性修改少量难样本以嵌入难以察觉但可验证的痕迹。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多个模型架构上的广泛实验表明，HoneyImage能始终实现高验证准确率，对下游性能影响极小且难以察觉。

Conclusion: HoneyImage可为数据所有者提供实用机制，保护有价值图像数据集所有权，促进安全共享，释放数据驱动AI的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

Method: 评估结合自动编码器特征提取能力与循环神经网络、3D卷积神经网络等进行时间序列建模的混合深度学习方法，并在三个不同数据集上评估。

Result: 方法表现良好，SSIM指标从0.69提升到0.82，利用3DCNNs和ConvLSTMs的混合模型最有效，灰度真实视频最易预测。

Conclusion: 利用3DCNNs和ConvLSTMs的混合模型在视频帧预测中效果最佳，灰度真实视频相对容易预测。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法存在效率低和语义失真问题，且忽视颜色在其中的双重作用，为解决这些问题开展研究。

Method: 提出DC3框架，经校准选择策略后，利用潜在扩散模型增强图像颜色多样性而非创建新图像，还使用压缩数据集微调预训练扩散模型。

Result: 广泛实验表明DC3在多个基准上优于SOTA方法，FID结果证明使用高质量数据集训练网络可行，无模型崩溃等问题。

Conclusion: DC3框架性能优越、泛化性好，是首个用压缩数据集微调预训练扩散模型的研究。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制采用统一标准，未考虑用户个体偏好，忽略了年龄、心理健康和个人信仰等因素塑造的不同安全边界。

Method: 提出PSA框架，将个性化用户配置文件集成到扩散过程中，引入新数据集Sage，通过交叉注意力机制纳入用户配置文件。

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制方面优于现有方法，生成内容更符合用户约束，获得更高胜率和通过率分数。

Conclusion: PSA是一种有效的个性化安全对齐框架，可在生成模型中实现用户特定的安全控制。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Result: 研究结果准确率超90%。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来快速且经济高效地评估路面网络铺平道路。

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存增强TTA方法依赖低熵标准选样本构建原型，在分布偏移下低熵样本不可靠，原型无法保证类内紧凑性。

Method: 提出MCP方法，有熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存；开发MCP++框架，含跨模态原型对齐和残差学习及原型残差微调。

Result: 在15个下游任务的对比和消融实验中，所提方法和框架达到SOTA泛化性能。

Conclusion: MCP和MCP++方法能有效提升零样本测试时自适应的泛化性能。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决现有问题，提高了WSI分类性能

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Conclusion: CSINet能有效解决现有方法局限，在遥感图像分割任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Conclusion: ViLaCo框架有效解决了弱监督下图像伪造定位问题，通过引入外部语义监督提升了定位性能。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: VLMs为可扩展的动态交通视频分析提供了经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Method: 提出SFAE框架，将频带“空间化”，开发跨域融合注意力模块，对两个域预测并应用不同的伽马参数进行自适应非线性调整。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Conclusion: MiraGe方法在可泛化的AI生成图像检测方面表现出色，能有效应对未知生成器。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than

adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run

Result: 在目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等下游任务取得了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: TESPEC能有效学习事件的时空信息，适用于循环模型。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Conclusion: DMTrack架构有效，能以较少参数实现良好的多模态跟踪性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Result: 模型性能依赖于领域，对复杂航天器能生成高质量图像，对简单小行星能实现更好几何重建，Hunyuan - 3D在航天器上感知得分最高，在小行星上几何精度最佳。

Conclusion: 相比之前工作有显著进展，建立了新的基准。

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

<details>

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题，现有方法多针对局部区域，本文从新的地图级视角解决该问题。

Method: 提出Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP)方法，运用Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention聚合信息，用Global-Local Logit Fusion机制融合对数几率进一步优化预测。

Result: 该方法在POPE、MME和MMHal - Bench等基准测试中持续提升了大视觉语言模型的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: 地图级解码策略在减轻大视觉语言模型幻觉问题上有潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Motivation: 探索提升多种图像编辑任务性能的策略。

Method: 采用统一处理文本和视觉标记的自回归多模态模型，研究监督微调、强化学习和思维链推理三种策略。

Result: RL结合大模型验证器最有效，发布EARL模型，在多种编辑任务上表现出色且使用更少训练数据。

Conclusion: EARL推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑上的发展。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at
https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

TL;DR: 提出Prompt - in - Image方法嵌入文本指令到图像，在三个开源VLMs上评估，对Qwen2.5 - VL有提升，对LLaVA - 1.5和InstructBLIP有性能下降，分析了原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision - Language Models (VLMs)因多模态信息对齐困难导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Prompt - in - Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，让模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Prompt - in - Image提高了Qwen2.5 - VL的性能，POPE准确率提升4.1%，减少MS - COCO上的幻觉率；LLaVA - 1.5和InstructBLIP性能严重下降。

Conclusion: CLIP基编码器对嵌入文本区域有过度注意力偏差，Qwen的视觉编码器能稳健处理文本嵌入图像，Prompt - in - Image减少了Qwen的模态差距，增强跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频检索方法多利用视觉线索，忽视音频语义或采用粗融合策略，导致多模态表示不佳。

Method: 提出GAID框架，包含帧级门控融合（FGF）和定向自适应语义扰动（DASP）两个组件。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验，所有检索指标达SOTA，且有显著效率提升。

Conclusion: GAID框架能有效解决现有方法问题，生成更稳定和有表现力的表示。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Conclusion: 需要更复杂的多模态和时间感知方法，HateClipSeg数据集公开可用。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing
datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both
video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments
labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting,
Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results
highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more
sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Conclusion: 提出了适用于机器人辅助手术场景的增强型类增量语义分割方法TOPICS+及相关基准和标签集，代码和模型公开供研究。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Method: 设计O - Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，用辅助模糊感知网络捕捉非典型模式，引入基于HSIC的对比去偏模块。

Result: 在多种多视图基准测试中，框架持续提升未知类识别能力，保持强封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 提出的多视图开放集学习框架有效可行。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Result: 方法能对模型进行基于概念的深度解释，首次在细粒度层面识别与特定视觉概念相关的电路。

Conclusion: 验证了GCC方法在各种深度图像分类模型中的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

Method: 提出统一的两阶段框架INSIGHT，第一阶段从手-物交互区域提取特征并使用动名词共现矩阵增强动作表示；第二阶段引入基于强化学习的模块，通过视觉感知、意图推断和动作预测的结构化过程模拟显式认知推理。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC - Kitchens - 55和EGTEA Gaze+基准测试中，INSIGHT达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: INSIGHT有效且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型使用含敏感信息的大数据集引发隐私担忧，差分隐私数据生成需大量数据，现有私有数据集蒸馏方法存在同步采样优化和依赖噪声训练信号问题，导致隐私信息利用低效。

Method: 引入新框架，将采样与优化解耦以实现更好收敛，通过在信息子空间匹配减轻差分隐私噪声影响来提高信号质量。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小为现有方法五分之一时提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的新框架有显著潜力推动隐私保护的数据集蒸馏发展。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Conclusion: 统一的多摄像头系统能在复杂室内环境实时跟踪奶牛，减少重叠摄像头冗余检测，保持跟踪连续性，有助于通过活动量化和行为分类实现早期疾病预测。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Motivation: 现有3D异常检测方法按特定类别训练，缺乏从新类别学习的能力。

Method: 提出C3D - AD框架，包括引入KAL提取广义局部特征、KAA机制正确持续重建数据、RPP模块保持任务间表示一致性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实验，在Real3D - AD、Anomaly - ShapeNet和MulSen - AD上AUROC平均性能分别达66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: 所提C3D - AD方法有效。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Motivation: RGB 3D任务存在标注稀缺昂贵、增强工具少，图像变换破坏几何一致性问题。

Method: 引入3DRot，围绕相机光心旋转和镜像图像，同步更新相关信息以保持投影几何。

Result: 在SUN RGB - D数据集上，提升了$IoU_{3D}$、$mAP_{0.5}$，降低了旋转误差，优于Cube R - CNN。

Conclusion: 3DRot可用于其他3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs核心特征，提出LetheViT对比遗忘方法，用掩码图像输入生成正对数，原始图像输入生成负对数。

Result: LetheViT取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LetheViT能有效平衡隐私合规与模型效能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Conclusion: PatchMap和启发式方法有助于加速定位感知防御和自适应攻击研究，相关成果将公开。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

Result: 在多个公共数据集和自有数据集上实验，IAUNet优于大多数最先进的全卷积、基于Transformer、基于查询的模型以及特定的细胞分割模型。

Conclusion: IAUNet为细胞实例分割任务设定了强大的基线。

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Result: 在CIFAR - 10和GTSRB上的实验结果表明，DBOM能在下游训练前稳健检测中毒图像。

Conclusion: DBOM能显著增强DNN训练管道的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Motivation: 现有研究未系统探究图像预处理步骤对不同医学成像模态分割性能的影响，尤其是边缘在基础模型预训练中的作用。

Method: 训练基础模型的两个版本，分别基于原始数据和边缘增强数据，微调后进行系统研究，提出基于原始图像标准差和熵的元学习策略。

Result: 边缘聚焦预训练使不同模态分割性能有增有减，集成元学习层比仅用边缘增强数据或原始数据预训练的模型，整体分割性能分别提升16.42%和19.30%。

Conclusion: 边缘聚焦预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能有效提升医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督异常检测假设训练数据均正常，需手动筛选数据，存在引入偏差和限制适应性的问题。

Method: 结合Soft Confident Learning和Meta - Learning，前者降低低置信度样本权重，后者根据训练验证损失协方差正则化更新以稳定训练，且该方法与模型无关。

Result: 在MVTec - AD、VIADUCT和KSDD2数据集上，使用两个最先进模型实验，持续优于基线方法，对训练集中异常不敏感，在所有数据集上达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: CoMet方法有效，可让深度异常检测模型从无筛选数据集学习，提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Conclusion: 全身表征作为独立筛查方式或多模态框架一部分，在临床工作流程的早期个性化风险分层中有转化潜力。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Conclusion: 鼓励深入探索提升VLMs的时空基础能力，为动态环境下更强大可靠的视觉智能发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

Conclusion: DreamEcom - 400K数据集和DreamPainter框架可有效解决电商场景背景生成挑战。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Result: 在多个基准测试中显示出参数和数据效率高，线性探测和小数据训练表现优于现有方法，全微调精度有显著提升。

Conclusion: GaussianCross方法有效，能解决当前3D场景理解中自监督预训练的挑战。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

TL;DR: 提出新方法利用泰勒展开加速Diffusion Transformers推理，平衡速度与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Diffusion Transformers推理速度慢，训练-free方法有内存和计算开销大、未考虑预测准确性变化等问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后块级，减少缓存特征；用第一个块的泰勒估计和实际输出的误差作为预测可靠性指标，实现动态缓存机制。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现3.17x、2.36x和4.14x加速，质量下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 新方法能更好地平衡Diffusion Transformers推理的速度和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

TL;DR: 提出一种通过相机推断道路布局来解释雷达点云数据，以定位非视距行人的新框架，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境非视距区域行人定位对自动驾驶系统是重大挑战，毫米波雷达点云数据易受多径反射干扰，相机图像缺乏深度感知且无法直接观测非视距物体。

Method: 利用相机视觉信息解释2D雷达点云数据，实现空间场景重建。

Result: 在真实车辆搭载的雷达 - 相机系统上进行实验，使用户外非视距驾驶环境数据集评估定位性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

TL;DR: 提出Text2Lip框架用于生成会说话的人脸，在多方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频驱动方法在生成会说话人脸时依赖高质量配对数据及声学映射唇部动作模糊的问题，提高可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Method: 构建以视位为中心的Text2Lip框架，将文本输入嵌入视位序列，设计渐进式视位 - 音频替换策略，使用地标引导渲染器。

Result: Text2Lip在语义保真度、视觉真实感和模态鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控且灵活的会说话人脸生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

TL;DR: 本文提出Hydra方法，结合毫米波雷达与相机技术检测叶片湿度及持续时间，实验表明其在不同场景下有较高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有叶片湿度持续时间（LWD）检测缺乏标准化技术，不同植物特性下效果不佳，先前方法不能直接测量自然叶片且在不同环境中缺乏韧性。

Method: 设计CNN选择性融合多个毫米波深度图像与RGB图像生成特征图像，开发基于Transformer的编码器捕捉特征图像联系生成特征图，再用分类器检测，训练时扩充数据集。

Result: Hydra在不同场景下对叶片湿度分类准确率最高达96%，在农场不同环境下准确率约90%。

Conclusion: Hydra方法具有创新性，能有效检测叶片湿度及持续时间，在实际农业场景中有应用潜力。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

TL;DR: 提出CoCoLIT框架用于从MRI合成淀粉样蛋白PET扫描，在公开数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用更易获取的MRI合成PET扫描进行大规模阿尔茨海默病筛查，现有MRI到PET转换方法因数据高维复杂面临挑战。

Method: 提出CoCoLIT，包含加权图像空间损失、潜在平均稳定化分析和基于ControlNet的条件调节三个创新点。

Result: 在公开数据集上，模型在图像和淀粉样蛋白相关指标上显著优于现有方法，在淀粉样蛋白阳性分类中表现出色。

Conclusion: CoCoLIT是一种有效的从MRI合成PET扫描的方法，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible
structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for
large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence
that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless
encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered
through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural
complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing
MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a
lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more
effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned
Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that
incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss
(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)
a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an
existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference
consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for
MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available
datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in
amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method
with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external
dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at
https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

Motivation: 传统CNN需要大量计算资源和训练数据集，为解决此局限开展研究。

Method: 应用迁移学习，对比EfficientNetV2、EfficientNet和ResNet50对脑肿瘤（胶质瘤、脑膜瘤和垂体瘤）进行分类。

Result: EfficientNetV2性能优于其他模型，但训练时间增加。

Conclusion: EfficientNetV2在脑肿瘤分类中有更好表现，但因模型复杂导致训练时间长。

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the
interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand
extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these
limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong
classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the
study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with
ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and
pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior
performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the
cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计生物脑年龄是识别神经退行性疾病相关加速衰老的关键成像生物标志物，但优化3D模型有梯度消失等问题，且性别差异影响衰老轨迹，需要提升预测模型准确性和泛化性。

Method: 提出DSMT - AE框架，采用深度监督稳定模型优化，多任务学习增强特征表示，同时优化脑年龄预测、性别分类和图像重建任务。

Conclusion: DSMT - AE框架能有效捕捉解剖和人口统计学变异性，提高脑年龄预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)
T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker
for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage
comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing
spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains
challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain
structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging
trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making
sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of
predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised
Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE
employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at
intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and
multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our
framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary
tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively
capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction
accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark
(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.
Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component
substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of
the overall architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤性SAH死亡率超30%，相关血肿类型的迁移学习有价值但未充分探索，LoRA方法在医学影像卷积神经网络中应用少。

Method: 实现预训练Unet架构，在30例患者上用3折交叉验证微调；开发基于张量CP分解的CP - LoRA方法和DoRA变体；对比不同方法和策略。

Result: LoRA方法始终优于标准Unet微调；性能随血肿体积变化，大体积时精度提高；CP - LoRA用更少参数达相似性能；高秩过参数化表现更好。

Conclusion: 不同血肿类型间迁移学习可行，LoRA方法在动脉瘤性SAH分割中显著优于传统Unet微调。

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological
emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related
hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach.
Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image
segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been
rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We
implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from
124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then
fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health
System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based
on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,
CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional
components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,
convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a
multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard
Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods
showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable
performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.
Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance
than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer
learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods
significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH
segmentation.

Conclusion: AMBER - AFNO在3D医学数据立方体分割任务中能降低模型复杂度，提高效率和性能。

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote
sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally
designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D
medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture
with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head
self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of
attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through
frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This
design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to
UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art
architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical
datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO
achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training
efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

Result: DRKF在IEMOCAP、MELD和M3ED数据集上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DRKF方法有效，可解决多模态情感识别的关键问题。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by
integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However,
inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain
key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a
Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF
consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module
and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual
information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to
decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features
while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight
self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality
and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused
representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality
selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion
Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to
retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even
if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion
Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging
preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In 1981, Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] conjectured that given a
set system $A \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ with degree at most $k$ (i.e., each
column of $A$ has at most $k$ non-zeros), its combinatorial discrepancy
$\mathsf{disc}(A) := \min_{x \in \{\pm 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$ is at most
$O(\sqrt{k})$. Previously, the best-known bounds for this conjecture were
either $O(k)$, first established by Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981],
or $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$, first proved by Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor.,
1998].
  We give an algorithmic proof of an improved bound of $O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$
whenever $k \geq \log^5 n$, thus matching the Beck-Fiala conjecture up to
$O(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ for almost the full regime of $k$.

Result: 在多个QA数据集实验中，动态规划工作流的方法能达到高答案质量，成本和延迟在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: MAO - ARAG框架有效，能在保证答案质量的同时控制成本和延迟。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Motivation: 实现端到端业务分析和市场报告的自动化生成。

Method: 采用专业代理（研究员、评审员、撰写员和检索员）协作，通过上下文学习借鉴亚马逊专业顾问资料，执行多步骤流程，并引入基于大语言模型的评估系统和迭代改进机制。

Result: 自动评审周期和顾问的非结构化知识能提升报告质量，7分钟生成6页详细报告，成本约1美元。

Conclusion: 该工作是自动创建经济实惠市场洞察的重要一步。

Abstract: We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automate end-to-end business analysis and market report generation.
At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

Motivation: 自动分析对话可理解和引导咨询等领域的行为，研究对动机性访谈治疗风格的行为代码建模以提供实时指导。

Method: 定义基于对话建模成功经验的神经网络模型，用于对治疗师和客户的行为代码分类以及预测即将到来的话语代码。

Result: 模型在两个任务上均优于多个基线。

Conclusion: 对网络设计权衡对治疗对话建模的影响进行了仔细分析并报告结果。

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Motivation: 人类辅导干预对学生学习很重要，但大规模收集、标注和分析辅导对话来开发机器学习模型是挑战且资源密集，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出SAGA22紧凑数据集，探索包括对话上下文、说话者信息、预训练数据集和进一步微调等多种建模策略，利用课堂教学现有数据集和模型。

Result: 在课堂数据上进行补充预训练能提升辅导场景下模型性能，尤其是结合更长上下文和说话者信息时。

Conclusion: 强调了谈话策略建模存在挑战。

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student
learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This
paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Motivation: 解决话语分析中多功能性和特定领域话语移动分类遗漏问题，以提供有效反馈改进数学教育教学实践。

Method: 提出集成特定领域谈话移动、对话行为和话语关系的多视角话语分析，采用自上而下分析框架，应用于两个数学教育数据集，通过分布一元分析、顺序谈话移动分析和多视图深入研究。

Conclusion: 强调将话语关系和对话行为纳入AI辅助教育系统以增强反馈和创建响应式学习环境，框架对提供教育者反馈和开发AI代理有帮助。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中因知识、能力和数据不足产生幻觉，且现有基准无法有效评估和解决，需要新的评估方法和解决方案。

Method: 引入EH - Benchmark评估MLLMs的幻觉，将幻觉分类，提出以智能体为中心的三阶段框架。

Result: 多智能体框架显著减少了两种类型的幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 所提出的EH - Benchmark和多智能体框架能有效解决MLLMs在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型会产生幻觉，在企业应用中危害大，且客服中心对话分析的事实性评估因缺乏真实标签而面临独特挑战。

Method: 在人工标注指南和LLM评判者提示中引入3D范式；创建FECT基准数据集；使LLM评判者对齐3D范式。

Result: 给出使LLM评判者对齐3D范式的研究结果。

Conclusion: 提出自动评估客服中心对话分析AI系统输出事实性的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

Method: 用斯坦福eConsult团队的145个专家模板评估前沿模型，通过多智能体管道结合提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析。

Result: 部分模型如o3综合度高，但生成模板过长，不能在长度限制下正确排序重要问题；不同专科表现不同，叙事驱动领域性能下降。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可加强医生间结构化临床信息交换，但需要能捕捉模型在现实交流时间限制下对临床重要信息排序能力的评估方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内容限制存在挑战，不同用户需求差异大、变化快，传统微调方法成本高，需轻量级策略。

Method: 提出AdaCoRe任务和SOP方法，在提示词后添加优化后缀；创建CoReBench基准评估。

Result: SOP在CoReBench上表现优于系统级基线；在POE平台上也有效。

Conclusion: SOP方法能有效防止大语言模型生成受限词，具有实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有网络基准聚焦简单交互，传统数据科学基准关注静态数据集，都无法评估端到端网络数据科学工作流，因此需要新基准。

Method: 引入包含870个跨29个不同网站的网络数据科学任务的WebDS基准进行评估。

Result: 当前SOTA LLM代理完成任务有显著性能差距，如Browser Use在WebDS中成功率远低于Web Voyager，且存在新失败模式。

Conclusion: WebDS提供更强大和真实的测试环境，将推动实用的基于LLM的数据科学发展。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

Conclusion: D - SCoRE简单且可扩展，能实现跨领域高效问答生成和高性能微调。

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Result: 在多个标准多跳问答基准测试中表现有竞争力，可与现有先进模型媲美，各组件有效。

Conclusion: ORACLE 框架有效，能生成更具逻辑性和可解释性的推理链。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

Conclusion: 提示结构意识和可控扰动对大模型可靠的对抗鲁棒性评估很重要。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测多为二分类，作者归属局限于单语言，而现代大语言模型是多语言的，需研究多语言作者归属问题。

Method: 聚焦18种语言和8个生成器，研究单语言作者归属方法的多语言适用性、跨语言可迁移性及生成器对归属性能的影响。

Result: 部分单语言作者归属方法可适配多语言场景，但存在显著局限和挑战，跨不同语系迁移问题突出。

Conclusion: 多语言作者归属问题复杂，需更鲁棒的方法以匹配现实场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文引入CUPID基准评估大语言模型推断用户上下文偏好的能力，发现当前模型存在不足，强调提升模型上下文个性化交互能力的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型个性化常假设用户偏好静态，而实际人类偏好是动态的，需评估模型推断和应用上下文偏好的能力。

Method: 引入CUPID基准，包含756个人工策划的用户与大语言模型聊天助手的交互会话历史，评估模型根据新请求和先前会话推断偏好并生成满足偏好响应的能力。

Result: 评估10个开源和专有大语言模型，发现当前最先进的模型在多轮交互中推断偏好以及辨别先前上下文与新请求相关性方面存在困难，精确率低于50%，召回率低于65%。

Conclusion: 强调需要提升大语言模型上下文个性化交互能力，并提出CUPID作为推动改进的资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

TL;DR: 提出Collaborative Chain - of - Agents框架，含CoCoA - zero和CoCoA策略，提升大语言模型在检索增强生成中对知识的协同利用，实验表现佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）方法在生成时难以充分利用知识，模型内部参数知识与外部检索知识协同有限。

Method: 提出CoCoA - zero多智能体RAG框架，先进行条件知识归纳再推理答案；在此基础上开发CoCoA长链训练策略，合成推理轨迹微调大语言模型。

Result: CoCoA - zero和CoCoA在开放域和多跳问答任务中取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 所提框架和策略能有效提升模型对参数和检索知识的集成与协同利用能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

TL;DR: 现有希伯来语NLP基准忽视语义维度，本文创建希伯来语MRC数据集HeQ，提出新标注指南、众包协议和评估指标，揭示标准评估指标不适用于希伯来语，模型在形态句法和MRC任务表现相关性低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前希伯来语NLP基准主要关注形态句法任务，忽略语义维度，需创建希伯来语MRC数据集填补空白。

Method: 设计新标注指南、受控众包协议和修订评估指标，创建HeQ数据集。

Result: 创建包含30147个问答对的HeQ数据集，发现标准评估指标不适用于希伯来语，模型在形态句法和MRC任务表现相关性低。

Conclusion: HeQ的开发和探索展示了形态丰富语言在NLU中的挑战，有助于推动希伯来语和其他形态丰富语言的NLU模型发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SPARQL方法在低资源领域泛化性差，难以处理跨图查询，在循环经济领域挑战大。

Method: 将KGQA分解为子任务，由专门代理管理，调度器用弱到强对齐策略分配子目标，两阶段验证器检测查询。

Result: 在循环经济知识图谱实验中，执行准确率提升17.3%，三元组F1提升25.4%，平均提示长度减少46.4%。

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式感知推理对可扩展KGQA有益，支持可持续领域决策。

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Conclusion: 所提方法和模型有效，能提升网络智能体的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

Motivation: 大语言模型在智能应用中广泛使用，需强大安全防护模型，但非英语语言因收集文化对齐标注数据集成本高而缺乏进展。

Method: 采用四阶段合成数据生成和过滤管道（文化数据分离、文化数据适应、机器翻译、质量过滤），将英文数据集转换扩展。

Result: 得到包含9种语言386,661个样本的多语言数据集，训练模型在多语言内容安全基准测试中达到SOTA表现。

Conclusion: 该工作是缩小多语言大语言模型安全差距的重要一步，有助于开发具有文化意识的安全防护模型。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型再训练，可集成到现有大语言模型管道作为实时验证机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型发展迅速，但低资源语言在NLP领域仍受忽视，旨在为旁遮普语开发大语言模型。

Method: 从35GB多领域语料从头训练PunGPT2，用优化分词器和预训练目标；引入Pun - RAG框架；开发Pun - Instruct变体；提出Quantum - RAG混合检索系统。

Result: 模型在困惑度、事实性和流畅性上显著优于多语言基线模型。

Conclusion: 为低资源语言扩展LLM能力提供可扩展、可复现蓝图，开创低资源NLP量子感知检索先河。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

Result: 实验证明LHF与词汇过度使用有关，参与者会系统地偏好包含特定词汇的文本变体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理视频长帧序列推理时存在局限，限制了其在具身场景中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归地将长视频轨迹分解为对应子任务的片段，采用上下文学习方法实现。

Result: 在多个视频推理任务中，ROVER优于强基线模型，减少了幻觉，时间复杂度随视频长度线性增长。

Conclusion: ROVER框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在长视频帧序列推理的问题，有更好的推理性能和时间复杂度。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中提示模板扩展导致难以维护、推理延迟和服务成本增加，需要解决该问题。

Method: 引入ProCut框架，将提示模板分段，量化各部分对任务性能的影响并修剪低效用组件，还引入LLM驱动的归因估计器。

Result: 在五个公共基准数据集和实际工业提示上实验，实现提示大小大幅减少，同时维持或提升任务性能，归因估计器降低压缩延迟超50%，且能与现有框架集成。

Conclusion: ProCut是一个灵活、与LLM无关、无需训练的框架，能产生简洁高效的提示。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

Motivation: 解决藏语作为低资源语言存在的严重数据稀缺问题。

Method: 通过大语言模型的思维链提示自动构建TIBSTC - CoT数据集，基于此数据集开发Sunshine - thinking大模型家族。

Result: Sunshine - thinking在推理和生成方面表现出色，与最先进的多语言大模型相当。

Conclusion: 通过资源创建和模型创新实现高质量藏语处理，是迈向包容性人工智能的重要一步。

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language
spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale,
multi-domain Tibetan dataset automatically constructed via chain-of-thought
prompting with large language models (LLMs). TIBSTC-CoT establishes a scalable
and reproducible framework for dataset creation in low-resource settings,
covering diverse domains and reasoning patterns essential for language
understanding and generation. Building on this dataset, we develop the
Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT,
Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance,
comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a
significant step toward inclusive AI by enabling high-quality Tibetan language
processing through both resource creation and model innovation. All data are

### [494] [The SMeL Test: A simple benchmark for media literacy in language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02074)
*Gustaf Ahdritz,Anat Kleiman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍合成媒体素养测试（SMeL Test）来测试语言模型过滤不可信信息的能力，对多种大语言模型进行基准测试，发现模型存在问题并希望为解决幻觉问题提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网存在大量不可信内容，大语言模型进行自主网页浏览时，不清楚其是否掌握人类研究者筛选信息的简单启发式方法。

Method: 引入SMeL Test基准测试，对多种常用指令调优的大语言模型进行测试。

Result: 没有模型能始终信任更可靠的来源；推理能力与较高分数相关，但最好的API模型也有高达70%的幻觉率；更大、能力更强的模型不一定优于较小的模型。

Conclusion: 希望研究能为解决这种重要的幻觉问题提供更多启示，指导新方法的开发。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

TL;DR: 现有大音频语言模型评估侧重表面感知，本文引入 SpeechR 基准评估其推理能力，发现转录准确率高不代表推理能力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大音频语言模型评估主要关注表面感知，对基于语音场景的上下文和推理驱动的推理能力考察不足。

Method: 引入 SpeechR 基准，从事实检索、程序推理和规范判断三个关键维度，以选择题、生成式、声学特征三种评估形式进行评估。

Result: 对 11 个最先进的大音频语言模型评估发现，高转录准确率不意味着有强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR 为评估口语推理建立了结构化基准，能对不同对话任务的模型能力进行更有针对性的分析。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

Motivation: 缓解大语言模型逐 token 解码的固有延迟，提高推理速度。

Method: 基于离散状态扩散构建模型，利用非顺序、并行生成的方式。

Result: 在 H20 GPU 上推理速度达 2146 token/s，在标准代码评估基准上表现有竞争力，比 Mercury 和 Gemini Diffusion 更快。

Conclusion: Seed Diffusion Preview 在代码模型的速度 - 质量权衡前沿上达到了新的最优状态。

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto
frontier for code models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理基准测试表现好，但输入稍有变化易失败，怀疑成功依赖记忆，尤其是思维链推理中记忆模式会导致错误。

Method: 引入STIM框架，基于预训练语料中统计共现情况，将推理链中每个标记归因于本地、中程或远程等多种记忆源。

Result: 跨任务和分布设置的标记级分析显示，复杂或长尾情况模型更依赖记忆，本地记忆是错误主因，可达67%错误标记，STIM记忆分数可有效预测错误推理步骤中的错误标记。

Conclusion: STIM是诊断和改进模型推理的有力工具，可推广到其他结构化逐步生成任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

Motivation: MoE架构大语言模型有计算和存储开销问题，且性能提升与专家参数增长不成比例，先前工作在性能和计算效率上有挑战。

Method: 引入微专家作为压缩单元，提出CAMERA框架识别冗余，在此基础上提出CAMERA - P修剪框架和CAMERA - Q量化思路。

Result: 在九个下游任务实验中，CAMERA - P在20% - 60%修剪率下优于基线，CAMERA - Q在激进2位量化下效果更好，能在单GPU上5分钟内完成Qwen2 - 57B - A14B微专家分析。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决MoE架构大语言模型的计算和存储开销问题，在性能和计算效率上有优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KGE模型仅适用于静态知识图，CKGE面临模型“灾难性遗忘”问题，需有效缓解。

Method: 提出BAKE模型，将新数据视为模型先验的贝叶斯更新，维护模型后验分布；提出持续聚类方法，约束不同快照新旧知识的演化差异。

Result: 在多个数据集上对BAKE进行大量实验，结果表明其显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE模型能有效缓解CKGE的“灾难性遗忘”问题，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

Motivation: 大语言模型强大但成本高，研究元学习能否让小语言模型预训练更好且更具可解释性。

Method: 将一阶MAML与子集掩码LM预训练相结合，构建四个LLama风格的仅解码器模型。

Result: 相比普通训练，模型更快达到相同损失，在多语言通用命名实体识别上提升F1分数，训练动态易于解读。

Conclusion: 所提出方法有效，训练动态的曲线可作为元适应的可解释特征。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Conclusion: 研究结果为大语言模型生成具有文化意义和形式约束的文学文本的优势和局限性提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Result: 使用AlgGeoTest对最先进大语言模型的广泛评估揭示了它们在代数几何理解上的严重不足。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准测试为人工智能系统数学智能的深入研究开辟了新道路。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Conclusion: Llama能在无明确语音或听觉基础下，形成用于完成语音任务的音素内部模型。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基于Transformer的语言模型在处理复杂技术工程文档的细粒度语法和实体关系时存在困难，特定领域需要更强上下文和结构感知的模型。

Method: 构建动态图，用GATv2Conv层处理进行局部结构学习，将丰富嵌入传递给Transformer编码器捕获全局依赖，采用两阶段训练方法。

Result: 集成到RAG管道中，比GPT - 2准确率高24.7%，参数少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT适应技术语言，能在现实应用中实现更好的基础、实体跟踪和检索增强响应。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

Motivation: 临床文本自动标注对提取结构化数据和决策支持至关重要，手动标注SNOMED CT概念劳动密集且难以大规模实施。

Method: 采用双向GRU模型，利用MIMIC - IV子集，用领域适配的SpaCy和基于SciBERT的分词方法预处理文本，将句子分割成19个标记的重叠块并添加多种特征，用Bi - GRU模型分配IOB标签识别概念范围。

Conclusion: 轻量级基于RNN的架构能以比基于Transformer的模型更低的计算成本提供高质量临床概念标注，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

Motivation: RLVR中策略的熵与性能交换很重要，但对其何时及如何有效运作理解有限，需深入探究。

Method: 将训练过程按熵动态分为上升和平台阶段，从阶段、实例、标记粒度系统研究交换机制；提出用困惑度和位置信息动态调整奖励信号的方法。

Result: 上升阶段负样本熵减少促进有效推理模式学习，带来性能快速提升；平台阶段学习效率与低困惑度样本中的高熵标记及序列末尾标记强相关。

Conclusion: 提出的两种方法在各种大语言模型上相比基线方法有改进。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

TL;DR: 当前自然语言处理大规模数据集面临许可、更新和质量保证问题，本文提出Dynaword方法和Danish Dynaword数据集，后者验证了方法可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自然语言处理大规模数据集在许可、更新和质量保证方面的挑战。

Method: 提出Dynaword方法作为创建可通过社区协作持续更新的大规模开放数据集的框架，并实现了Danish Dynaword数据集。

Result: Danish Dynaword的标记数量超可比版本四倍，仅采用开放许可，且获行业和研究界多次贡献，有轻量级测试确保数据质量。

Conclusion: Dynaword方法和Danish Dynaword数据集为社区持续贡献和数据集演化建立了可持续框架。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型KV缓存压缩方法有缺陷，提出CompressKV方法，实验显示其表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GQA的大语言模型KV缓存压缩方法忽略注意力头功能差异，会导致关键令牌被驱逐，降低模型性能。

Method: 识别能检索提示初始、最终令牌及文本内重要令牌并关注其上下文的注意力头，利用这些头确定重要令牌并保留对应KV缓存对，同时引入层自适应KV缓存分配策略。

Result: CompressKV在LongBench和Needle - in - a - Haystack基准测试的不同内存预算下，始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CompressKV方法有效提升了大语言模型KV缓存压缩性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出MArgE框架用于声明验证，能结构化多LLM证据，实验显示其性能优于单LLM和无结构多LLM辩论方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结合多LLM见解的方法多为无结构交互，导致模型生成结果无法合理解释，需改进。

Method: 引入MArgE框架，用ArgLLMs为给定声明构建结构化论证树。

Result: 实验表明MArgE显著优于单LLM、现有ArgLLMs和无结构多LLM辩论方法。

Conclusion: 结合多LLM输出时，融入正式的论证推理机制有优势。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

TL;DR: 使用特定长度Bloom过滤器构建图，证明在哈希函数黑盒情况下，找到图中特定大小团并求逆函数在多项式时间内可能无法完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在图构建中，基于Bloom过滤器和哈希函数，探讨找到特定大小团以及函数求逆的复杂度。

Method: 使用长度为2 log3 n位的Bloom过滤器，通过哈希函数处理节点对，选取log n个节点形成团，构建包含团选边和映射到开启位的边的图。

Result: 构建图可在n的多项式时间内完成，选择足够大的n的多对数Bloom过滤器，图中只有一个大小为log n的团，在哈希函数黑盒时，找到该团是难解的。

Conclusion: 在哈希函数黑盒情况下，将log n个节点映射到图的函数求逆在多项式时间内可能无法实现。

Abstract: Consider graphs of n nodes, and use a Bloom filter of length 2 log3 n bits.
An edge between nodes i and j, with i < j, turns on a certain bit of the Bloom
filter according to a hash function on i and j. Pick a set of log n nodes and
turn on all the bits of the Bloom filter required for these log n nodes to form
a clique. As a result, the Bloom filter implies the existence of certain other
edges, those edges (x, y), with x < y, such that all the bits selected by
applying the hash functions to x and y happen to have been turned on due to
hashing the clique edges into the Bloom filter.
  Constructing the graph consisting of the clique-selected edges and those
edges mapped to the turned-on bits of the Bloom filter can be performed in
polynomial time in n. Choosing a large enough polylogarithmic in n Bloom filter
yields that the graph has only one clique of size log n, the planted clique.
When the hash function is black-boxed, finding that clique is intractable and,
therefore, inverting the function that maps log n nodes to a graph is not
(likely to be) possible in polynomial time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化通信协议难以实现涌现性、群体智能，需要灵活、去中心化的协调方式，闲聊协议有潜力填补这一空白。

Method: 重新审视闲聊协议，分析其在智能体AI中作为上下文丰富、自适应通信层的潜力，提出研究议程而非新框架。

Result: 识别当前智能体间架构的关键差距，指出闲聊协议可能重塑协调假设的地方，列出意图传播、知识衰减和点对点信任等开放性问题。

Conclusion: 闲聊协议虽不是万能的，但忽视它可能错过构建有弹性、自反和自组织多智能体系统的关键途径。

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed
toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination.
Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent
messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in
enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents
continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This
paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their
fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing
layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables
scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises
unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,
and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new
framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a
complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical
gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could
reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around
intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a
silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,
reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Stackelberg博弈中领导者选择有偏差会导致不公平结果，特别是智能体自利时问题更严重。

Method: 提出在Stackelberg场景中以最小控制（领导者选择）集成调解者的多智能体强化学习框架。

Result: 调解者的存在使自利智能体采取公平行动，提高了智能体回报的整体公平性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决领导者选择的公平性问题。

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing
attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a
traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the
followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be
interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for
example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who
should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead
to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are
self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define
this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents'
returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously
been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control,
such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our
framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control
(leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to
self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall
fairness in agents' returns.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有社区搜索方法不足，提出基于传导性的社区搜索问题（CCS），证明其NP难，设计SCCS算法并通过实验验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社区搜索方法主要关注社区内部凝聚性，忽略外部稀疏性，导致结果不佳。

Method: 采用传导性指标衡量社区质量，提出CCS问题；证明其NP难；设计四阶段的SCCS算法，包括用局部采样缩小图规模，采用三阶段局部优化策略。

Result: 在包含十亿规模图的真实数据集和合成数据集上的大量实验表明，所提解决方案有效、高效且可扩展。

Conclusion: 所提出的CCS问题和SCCS算法能有效解决社区搜索问题，在效率和效果上表现良好。

Abstract: Community search is a widely studied semi-supervised graph clustering
problem, retrieving a high-quality connected subgraph containing the
user-specified query vertex. However, existing methods primarily focus on
cohesiveness within the community but ignore the sparsity outside the
community, obtaining sub-par results. Inspired by this, we adopt the well-known
conductance metric to measure the quality of a community and introduce a novel
problem of conductance-based community search (CCS). CCS aims at finding a
subgraph with the smallest conductance among all connected subgraphs that
contain the query vertex. We prove that the CCS problem is NP-hard. To
efficiently query CCS, a four-stage subgraph-conductance-based community search
algorithm, SCCS, is proposed. Specifically, we first greatly reduce the entire
graph using local sampling techniques. Then, a three-stage local optimization
strategy is employed to continuously refine the community quality. Namely, we
first utilize a seeding strategy to obtain an initial community to enhance its
internal cohesiveness. Then, we iteratively add qualified vertices in the
expansion stage to guarantee the internal cohesiveness and external sparsity of
the community. Finally, we gradually remove unqualified vertices during the
verification stage. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets containing one
billion-scale graph and synthetic datasets show the effectiveness, efficiency,
and scalability of our solutions.

Method: 对约1亿脸书页面成员中支持和反对疫苗观点的在线竞争进行独特映射，通过平台干预跟踪1356个相互关联的社区。

Result: 网络的基本架构没有变化，既定专业知识的孤立以及反疫苗和主流中立社区的共生现象持续存在。

Conclusion: 问题根源在于“全球 - 本地”演变，未来解决方案是聚焦系统网络，采用网络工程方法实现观点调节，从内容压制转向结构干预。

Abstract: What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money
spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this
using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination
views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected
communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's
fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established
expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist.
This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent,
nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in "glocal"
evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level
to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical
targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network. We
show how network engineering approaches can achieve opinion moderation without
content removal, representing a paradigm shift from suppression towards
structural interventions.

Result: 证明了算法的弱一致性，通过局部细化步骤确保强一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的谱聚类算法在软几何块模型的社区恢复问题上是有效的。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed
number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we
introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs
generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an
embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the
$k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a
value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means
clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple
local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an
application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control
eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the
limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial
and matrix techniques.

Motivation: 社交网络具有动态性，桥接节点可能被移除，需要有弹性的方法来维持社区间通信。

Method: 引入鲁棒桥接节点（RS），提出新颖的评分技术识别 RS 节点，给出基于 CUDA 的并行算法用于在大型网络中高效检测 RS 节点。

Result: 实证分析显示高得分节点跨社区能力与基准算法识别的节点相当且更鲁棒，在 Nvidia GPU 上实现比传统方法平均快 244 倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效在大型社交网络中识别 RS 节点。

Abstract: Social networks, characterized by community structures, often rely on nodes
called structural hole spanners to facilitate inter-community information
dissemination. However, the dynamic nature of these networks, where spanner
nodes may be removed, necessitates resilient methods to maintain
inter-community communication. To this end, we introduce robust spanners (RS)
as nodes uniquely equipped to bridge communities despite disruptions, such as
node or edge removals. We propose a novel scoring technique to identify RS
nodes and present a parallel algorithm with a CUDA implementation for efficient
RS detection in large networks. Empirical analysis of real-world social
networks reveals that high-scoring nodes exhibit a spanning capacity comparable
to those identified by benchmark spanner detection algorithms while offering
superior robustness. Our implementation on Nvidia GPUs achieves an average
speedup of 244X over traditional spanner detection techniques, demonstrating
its efficacy to identify RS in large social networks.

Motivation: 以往识别有影响力节点的方法要么只考虑网络结构的一个方面，要么使用高耗时的全局中心性作为节点特征，且未考虑不同中心性之间的关系。

Result: 两个FNGCN在识别有影响力的节点上比对比方法更准确。

Conclusion: 所提出的FNGCN框架在识别复杂网络中有影响力的节点方面是有效的。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and
has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in
e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase
intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help
locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying
influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in
networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying
influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of
the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as
node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not
consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these
problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature
Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as
GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency,
FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among
the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are
determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework,
two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used
Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with
the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results
show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately
than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective
in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.

<details>

Motivation: 许多标准分析方法在输入相异度不满足度量或欧氏公理时假设被违反，需要新的嵌入方法。

Method: 提出受物理启发、无梯度优化的Topolow框架，将对象建模为物理系统中的粒子，通过顺序、随机的成对交互进行优化。

Result: Topolow在重建稀疏和非欧氏数据几何结构上性能优于标准MDS方法。

Conclusion: Topolow无需输入相异度为度量，是嵌入非度量测量到有效欧氏空间的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: The problem of embedding a set of objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean
space based on a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities is fundamental in data
analysis, machine learning, and statistics. However, the assumptions of many
standard analytical methods are violated when the input dissimilarities fail to
satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. We present the mathematical and statistical
foundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization
framework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to
force-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by
its goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles
in a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through
sequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to
compute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local
optima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a
Laplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly
handles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input
dissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding
non-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use
of standard analytical tools. We demonstrate the superior performance of
Topolow compared to standard Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods in
reconstructing the geometry of sparse and non-Euclidean data. This paper
formalizes the algorithm, first introduced as Topolow in the context of
antigenic mapping in (Arhami and Rohani, 2025) (open access), with emphasis on
its metric embedding and mathematical properties for a broader audience. The
general-purpose function Euclidify is available in the R package topolow.

Method: 提出贝叶斯分层模型识别真实数据生成的有向无环图（DAG）结构，结合非高斯误差信息刻画DAG分布等价类，采用非标准DAG先验。

Result: 随着样本量增加，真实DAG分布等价类的后验概率收敛到1，方法达到后验DAG选择一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在学习变量因果结构方面有效，能实现后验DAG选择一致性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the underlying causal structure among a
set of variables, which are assumed to follow a Bayesian network or, more
specifically, a linear recursive structural equation model (SEM) with the
associated errors being independent and allowed to be non-Gaussian. A Bayesian
hierarchical model is proposed to identify the true data-generating directed
acyclic graph (DAG) structure where the nodes and edges represent the variables
and the direct causal effects, respectively. Moreover, incorporating the
information of non-Gaussian errors, we characterize the distribution
equivalence class of the true DAG, which specifies the best possible extent to
which the DAG can be identified based on purely observational data.
Furthermore, under the consideration that the errors are distributed as some
scale mixture of Gaussian, where the mixing distribution is unspecified, and
mild distributional assumptions, we establish that by employing a non-standard
DAG prior, the posterior probability of the distribution equivalence class of
the true DAG converges to unity as the sample size grows. This shows that the
proposed method achieves the posterior DAG selection consistency, which is
further illustrated with examples and simulation studies.

Conclusion: 这些结果为离线策略评估、最优策略恢复和转移概率假设检验提供了新工具。

Abstract: We develop a central limit theorem (CLT) for the non-parametric estimator of
the transition matrices in controlled Markov chains (CMCs) with finite
state-action spaces. Our results establish precise conditions on the logging
policy under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and reveal settings
in which no CLT can exist. We then build upon it to derive CLTs for the value,
Q-, and advantage functions of any stationary stochastic policy, including the
optimal policy recovered from the estimated model. Goodness-of-fit tests are
derived as a corollary, which enable us to test whether the logged data is
stochastic. These results provide new statistical tools for offline policy
evaluation and optimal policy recovery, and enable hypothesis tests for
transition probabilities.

TL;DR: 提出空间转录组学跨模态对比预训练基准HESCAPE，评估编码器，发现基因表达编码器对表征对齐重要，跨模态预训练在下游任务表现矛盾，指出批效应影响，呼吁鲁棒多模态学习方法并发布HESCAPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学领域缺乏评估结合组织学图像和基因表达数据的多模态学习方法的综合基准。

Method: 构建HESCAPE基准，基于精心策划的泛器官数据集，系统评估多种预训练策略下的图像和基因表达编码器，在基因突变分类和基因表达预测两个下游任务评估其有效性。

Result: 基因表达编码器是强表征对齐的主要决定因素；基于空间转录组学数据预训练的基因模型表现更好；跨模态预训练在基因突变分类上提升性能，但在基因表达预测上不如无跨模态目标的基线编码器；批效应干扰有效跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: 空间转录组学需要批鲁棒的多模态学习方法，发布HESCAPE以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community

Conclusion: GF构建了新的自适应生态系统，可加速科学发展、改变临床护理并促进个人成长，为人机共同发展提供平台。

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears?
Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed
to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment
demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry,
economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational
neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic,
multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior
across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior
and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional
tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across
perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as
a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes,
learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts
and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a
phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for
players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress
resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers
effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity),
uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how
clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way
for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to
cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem
designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual
growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines
co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAD流程复杂，需要专业绘图技能，对快速原型制作和生成式设计构成挑战，因此研究LLMs在自动化CAD工作流中的潜力。

Method: 提出一个框架，让LLMs从自然语言描述生成初始CAD脚本，根据错误反馈迭代执行和优化。

Result: 实验发现LLMs对简单到中度复杂设计表现良好，但处理高度约束模型有困难，需要多次优化。

Conclusion: 强调LLMs在设计工作流中的变革潜力，同时指出需改进内存检索、自适应提示工程和混合AI技术，未来可整合基于云的执行并探索高级LLM能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing
efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential
of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating
FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often
complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid
prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate
initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed
and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of
experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this
approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately
complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating
multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory
retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance
script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution
and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation.
This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows
while identifying critical areas for future development.

TL;DR: 研究通过实验揭示对话推荐系统用户交互偏好的影响因素，并提出适用对话式AI系统的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对影响对话推荐系统用户交互偏好的因素探索不足。

Method: 进行139人的受试者内研究，让参与者体验两种脚本化对话推荐系统对话，进行评分并表明系统质量重要性，采用逻辑回归、聚类和调节分析。

Result: 发现探索性交互偏好受享受感、有用性、新颖性和对话质量预测，感知有效性也与之相关；聚类出五种有不同对话风格偏好的潜在用户群；年龄、性别和控制偏好显著影响选择。

Conclusion: 研究将情感、认知和特质层面预测因素整合到用户建模中，为对话设计提供信息，提出的框架适用于对话式AI系统以满足用户需求。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised
recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly
support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors
shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this
within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS
dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight
system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the
exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and
conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also
associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user
profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses
indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced
these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level
predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive,
value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework
applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with
evolving user needs.

Result: 用户研究表明，与基线组相比，双DRL框架能提升用户表现。

Conclusion: 双DRL框架在增强用户表现方面具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide
intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to
improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback
could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user
attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL
policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this
trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may
require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose
a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user
performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user
cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the
feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user
performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社科与人文学科中，生物医学伦理模型不适用，部分地区缺乏定制化伦理培训、支持和专业REC，需解决这些问题。

Method: 借助宪法AI技术和协作式提示开发方法，构建EthicAlly系统进行结构化伦理评估。

Conclusion: 此类系统可支持研究者进行伦理研究设计和REC提交准备，减轻机构REC负担，且不试图自动化或取代人类伦理监督。

Abstract: In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an
indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social
science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with
scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies
involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result,
tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the
necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and
low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can
meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by
presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics
support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on
constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development
methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates
both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations
relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical
research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can
also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting
to automate or replace human ethical oversight.

Motivation: 准确估计手部姿态和手-物体接触事件在多领域重要，但因视觉遮挡等因素具有挑战性。

Method: 引入VibeMesh系统，集成骨传导扬声器和压电麦克风，发射和捕捉声学信号；提出基于图的注意力网络处理跨模态信号。

Result: 贡献了轻量级传感平台、跨模态图网络、数据集；VibeMesh在准确性和鲁棒性上优于仅视觉基线，尤其在遮挡或静态接触场景。

Conclusion: VibeMesh系统在手部接触和姿态估计方面表现良好，融合视觉与声学传感是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in
data visualization knowledge tasks. Through systematic comparative analysis of
responses to visualization questions, we find that differences exist between
two ChatGPT models and human outputs over rhetorical structure, knowledge
breadth, and perceptual quality. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT-4, as a more
advanced model, displays a hybrid of characteristics from both humans and
ChatGPT-3.5. The two models were generally favored over human responses, while
their strengths in coverage and breadth, and emphasis on technical and
task-oriented visualization feedback collectively shaped higher overall
quality. Based on our findings, we draw implications for advancing user
experiences based on the potential of LLMs and human perception over their
capabilities, with relevance to broader applications of AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代久坐活动增多引发健康等问题，现有姿势感应方法存在局限，需新的坐姿估计系统。

Method: 采用基于压力图训练的两阶段生成模型，将椅子形态纳入推理过程，引入物理驱动的数据增强管道。

Result: 在八名用户和四把不同椅子上评估，对未见用户和椅子的平均每关节位置误差为89.4毫米。

Conclusion: ChairPose具有鲁棒泛化性，可拓展姿势感知交互系统设计空间，在多领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments,
raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of
responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as
vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion,
privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We
introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation
system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of
chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on
pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the
inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving
pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we
introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic
variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and
four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of
89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust
generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the
design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications
in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

TL;DR: 提出IMUCoCo框架，将不同位置IMU信号映射到统一特征空间，支持灵活的运动感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IMU运动感知受限于传感器预设位置，适应性差，影响用户体验。

Method: 引入IMUCoCo框架，将身体表面任意数量IMU信号根据空间坐标映射到统一特征空间。

Result: IMUCoCo在典型和非典型传感器放置情况下都能实现准确的姿势估计。

Conclusion: IMUCoCo比现有技术更支持灵活使用IMU进行运动感知，允许用户按需放置传感器。

Abstract: IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and
estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in
predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors
and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the
increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited
adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few
well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we
rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured
from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates
(IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs
placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial
coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose
estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo
supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical
sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of
IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place
their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The
framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the
context and suggests placement depending on the use case.

Motivation: 传统心律失常监测方法依赖专业知识、接触式会让患者不适，现有非接触式监测在分析心律失常患者反射信号时有挑战。

Method: 引入精确目标定位（PTL）技术应对空间干扰，用编码器 - 解码器模型解决时间不一致问题。

Result: 在健康受试者和心律失常患者的大数据集上评估，mCardiacDx和PTL在心律失常监测诊断上优于现有方法，在健康受试者中表现也有提升。

Conclusion: mCardiacDx系统可有效用于心律失常监测和诊断，性能良好。

Abstract: Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe
complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is
essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as
electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on
specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature.
Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face
significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia
patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.
  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system
that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse
waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our
work include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates
reflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model
that transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.
Our evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients
shows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in
arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in
healthy subjects.

Result: 确定七个相互关联的关注领域。

Conclusion: 提出‘个性化路线图’，为开发者、临床医生和政策制定者提供利用行为数据并保留人文关怀的实用框架。

Abstract: Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective
computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented
opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy,
bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A
comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation
challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in
real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first
evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational,
technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP
technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers,
frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or
philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a
multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and
consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern
domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific
relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance;
(5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7)
philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic
safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that
predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared,
thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies
between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these
insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for
developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous
behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术技能获取依赖专家反馈，但存在获取受限和主观评估差异问题，自动能力评估虽可行，但AI驱动反馈对技能获取的作用不明，因此研究可解释AI生成反馈在手术训练中的有效性。

Method: 创建基于模拟的训练框架，利用XAI分析视频提取手术技能代理，通过比较学员表现与专家基准提供自动、特定用户反馈；进行前瞻性用户研究，对比XAI引导反馈与传统视频指导对任务结果、认知负荷和学员对AI辅助学习看法的影响。

Result: 干预后认知负荷和信心得到改善；两种反馈类型在缩小表现差距或练习调整上无差异，但XAI组有积极趋势，参与者更接近专家操作。

Conclusion: 鼓励研究可解释AI在手术教育中的应用，开发数据驱动、自适应反馈机制以改变学习体验和能力评估。

Abstract: Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet
direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective
assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of
personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of
self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning
have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility
of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill
acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI
(XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We
create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze
videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our
intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee
performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal
execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a
prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of
XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes,
cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results
showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no
differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps
or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects
where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages
the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of
data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning
experiences and competency assessment.

scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To
address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train
(TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and
scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation
of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling
optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates
gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank
representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on
Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical
analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization
stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across
quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum
simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior
performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway
toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised
learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We
introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation
strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR
decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby
enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods
across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German
Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform
leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under
limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect
of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement
entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some
level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased
circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current
quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical
insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and
stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in
advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained
by label availability and hardware limitations.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its
training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here,
through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both
classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their
response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle
memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum
models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase
transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point
beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further
establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process
of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show
that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories
of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum
model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate
unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can
possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability,
providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial
intelligence of the future.

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining
asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies.
Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and
financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional
imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional
structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting
in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we
introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion
framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing
multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key
innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional
heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal
smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving
slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation
accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity
scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed
data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial
data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also
significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio.
These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative
imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Conclusion: 所提基于RKHS的可计算估计器能有效确定稀疏加性非线性模型的结构。

Abstract: The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly
affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be
impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for
simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models
using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for
sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and
their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate
the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV)
system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and
indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the
NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV
coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse
estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)
framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural
relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined
by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and
the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two
computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The
sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical
simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: 所提机制能有效降低含恶意节点的无人机网络路由延迟，保障路由安全。

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster
rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due
to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing
security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the
routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes.
Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay,
which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to
tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management
mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify
low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance
algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism.
Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is
reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process.
Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is
designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with
attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed
mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent
proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and
methods without BTMM, respectively.

Abstract: Cross-process root-cause analysis of wafer defects is among the most critical
yet challenging tasks in semiconductor manufacturing due to the heterogeneity
and combinatorial nature of processes along the processing route. This paper
presents a new framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Potential
Loss Analysis (PLA), as a significant enhancement of the previously proposed
partial trajectory regression approach. The PLA framework attributes observed
high wafer defect densities to upstream processes by comparing the best
possible outcomes generated by partial processing trajectories. We show that
the task of identifying the best possible outcome can be reduced to solving a
Bellman equation. Remarkably, the proposed framework can simultaneously solve
the prediction problem for defect density as well as the attribution problem
for defect scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
using real wafer history data.

Result: 在非线性连续搅拌釜式反应器（CSTR）上展示出比现有一阶方法更快收敛和更高数据效率。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能在MPC中实现超线性收敛，提高训练鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its
interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in
reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data
requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most
RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter
spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy
update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC.
While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to
second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order
policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.
  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy
Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling
superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve
robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable
training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing
faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art
first-order methods.

Conclusion: 该方法结合因果图和机器学习，能准确预测故障并理解根源，是提高系统可靠性的实用工具。

Abstract: Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system
failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this
work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine
learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using
graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE).
Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as
voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence
each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and
GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of
the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable,
we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums
Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most
on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes
of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault
dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs
with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also
helps understand their root causes. This makes it a strong and practical tool
for improving system reliability.

Conclusion: TDMD在多维数据任务中能更高效计算，更好保留时空结构。

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a powerful data-driven method for
analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems.
However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations,
which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently
multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In
this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel
extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed
T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD
achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and
temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and
dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMD on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Motivation: 解决使用闪烁视觉刺激获取SSVEP时的眼疲劳问题和精确PWM建立困难导致的精度问题。

Method: 使用精确定制的LED硬件生成50 - 95%的PWM占空比，记录脑电图数据并测试十名受试者。

Result: 增加占空比可减少所有频率值下的视觉疲劳，SSVEP在占空比为85%时呈现与受试者无关的峰值响应。

Conclusion: 为SSVEP在实际应用中的更多使用铺平道路。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question,
given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized

the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter

Motivation: 孟加拉国农村面临医疗基础设施不足、信息系统不完善和医疗人员有限等障碍，阻碍疾病控制和疫情应对，需研究解决办法。

Method: 采用结构化方法开发和分析情景，对264名农村居民和103名医护人员进行问卷调查，用逻辑回归分析、Wilcoxon符号秩检验和Kendall系数评估。

Conclusion: AI驱动的本地化疾病控制策略可提升农村健康韧性和疫情应对能力，将生成式AI融入农村医疗需社区参与、提高数字素养和政府支持。

Abstract: Rural Bangladesh is confronted with substantial healthcare obstacles, such as
inadequate infrastructure, inadequate information systems, and restricted
access to medical personnel. These obstacles impede effective disease control
and pandemic preparedness. This investigation employs a structured methodology
to develop and analyze numerous plausible scenarios systematically. A purposive
sampling strategy was implemented, which involved the administration of a
questionnaire survey to 264 rural residents in the Rangamati district of
Bangladesh and the completion of a distinct questionnaire by 103 healthcare and
medical personnel. The impact and effectiveness of the study are assessed
through logistic regression analysis and a pre-post comparison that employs the
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kendall's coefficient for non-parametric paired
and categorical variables. This analysis evaluates the evolution of disease
control and preparedness prior to and subsequent to the implementation of the
Generative AI-Based Model 4.0. The results indicate that trust in AI (\b{eta} =
1.20, p = 0.020) and confidence in sharing health data (\b{eta} = 9.049, p =
0.020) are the most significant predictors of AI adoption. At the same time,
infrastructure limitations and digital access constraints continue to be
significant constraints. The study concludes that the health resilience and
pandemic preparedness of marginalized rural populations can be improved through
AI-driven, localized disease control strategies. The integration of Generative
AI into rural healthcare systems offers a transformative opportunity, but it is
contingent upon active community engagement, enhanced digital literacy, and
strong government involvement.

coding, which is structured, prompt-driven code generation with large language
models (LLMs) embedded in reproducible workflows, offers one pragmatic
response. It aims to compress the idea-to-analysis timeline, reduce staffing
pressure on specialized data roles, and maintain rigorous, version-controlled
outputs. This article defines the vibe coding concept, situates it against the
current academic resourcing crisis, details a beginner-friendly toolchain for
its implementation, and analyzes inherent limitations that necessitate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究工业5.0背景下生成式AI和自主系统成为关键地缘政治工具的战略影响。

Method: 综合技术、经济和伦理视角进行分析。

Result: 发现生成式AI影响全球权力层级和数字经济碎片化，带来治理挑战，影响国防、工业竞争力和供应链韧性。

Conclusion: 提出综合框架，呼吁构建平衡国家自主与国际协调、保障以人为本价值观的治理模式。

Abstract: Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing
human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of
advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI)
and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also
emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications
of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national
assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries
compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational
infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and
accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos
of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent
systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising
urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use
risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense
strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including
the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data
sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical
perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the
intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that
balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding
human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型参与导致在线行为研究有效性和完整性受威胁的问题。

Method: 识别大语言模型污染的三种变体（部分中介、完全委托、溢出效应），并提出跨研究者实践、平台责任和社区努力的多层应对策略。

Result: 三种变体相互作用产生级联扭曲，损害样本真实性、引入难以事后检测的偏差。

Conclusion: 需要协调适应以保障研究方法的完整性和有效性。

Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants
increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or
task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through
which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural
research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective
use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording
support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human
ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies
with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of
human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover
signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to
anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While
Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing
automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together,
these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise
sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc,
and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human
cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already
co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating
methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response
spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts.
As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard
methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域公平性至关重要，现有联邦学习研究多针对非医疗应用，且现有模型在医疗图像上表现不佳、忽视群体公平性。

Method: 建立医疗联邦学习公平性实验基准，评估六种联邦学习方法；引入FairFedMed数据集；提出基于SVD低秩逼近的公平感知联邦学习框架FairLoRA。

Result: FairLoRA在FairFedMed数据集上达到医疗图像分类的最优性能，显著提升不同群体公平性。

Conclusion: FairLoRA能有效解决医疗联邦学习中的公平性问题，代码和数据集可公开获取。

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to
services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While
Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving
approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to
heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily
addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first
experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six
representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging
modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically
designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:
FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six
demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real
cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they
support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and
demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and
overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose
FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank
approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group
while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.
Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but
also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and
dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

Method: 用四标准评分表评估67篇意大利语学生论文，每个模型对所有论文进行三次提示复制评分，评估模型内稳定性，分析人类与模型、模型间的一致性。

Result: 人类与模型评分一致性低且不显著，模型内可靠性弱，存在系统性评分差异，模型间在相关性和可行性上一致性可忽略。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在需要学科洞察和上下文敏感性的任务中难以复制人类判断，评估开放式学术作品时人类监督至关重要。

Abstract: This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large
Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral
24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A
total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university
psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence,
Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three
prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was
consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and
within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median
Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a
tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent
dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for
Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and
Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current
LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary
insight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when
evaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains.

Method: 提出基于服务发现的混合网络通信中间件RIMAOS2C，利用多级服务发现组播，核心机制Message Bridge优化数据转发和消息分发。

Result: 在L4车辆和Jetson Orin域控制器上测试，RIMAOS2C克服了原生CyberRT大消息传输瓶颈，消除消息冗余，提升大数据传输效率36 - 40%，减少回调延迟变化42 - 906%。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了机器人操作系统通信能力，为自动驾驶分布式计算架构通信优化提供新方法。

Abstract: Robotic middleware is fundamental to ensuring reliable communication among
system components and is crucial for intelligent robotics, autonomous vehicles,
and smart manufacturing. However, existing robotic middleware often struggles
to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission
efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in
large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a
service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to
tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast,
RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple
cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core
mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs
shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy
and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson
Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the
large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two
cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves
large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback
latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the
communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel
approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for
autonomous driving.

Abstract: We propose a novel Energy-Predictive Drone Service (EPDS) framework for

incorporates a formal modeling of an EPDS and an adaptive bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) machine learning model. This model predicts the
energy status and stochastic arrival times of other drones operating in the
same skyway network. Leveraging these predictions, we develop a heuristic
optimization approach for composite drone services. This approach identifies
the most time-efficient and energy-efficient skyway path and recharging
schedule for each drone in the network. We conduct extensive experiments using
a real-world drone flight dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework.

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能结合模型与学习的优势，实现样本高效学习与无特权信息下的枢转操作及仿真到现实的迁移。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

Motivation: 现有单特征距离启发式数据检索方法只能捕捉部分相关信息，可能引入有害演示。

Method: 提出COLLAGE方法，使用自适应后期融合机制，根据多线索组合选择相关演示，对数据集子集分配权重进行重要性采样。

Result: 在模拟的10个任务中，COLLAGE比现有检索和多任务学习方法高5.1%；在真实世界的6个任务中，高16.6%。

Conclusion: COLLAGE方法通用且与特征无关，能结合任意子集并识别对目标任务最有益的子集，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete

*Jiayuan Wang,Farhad Pourpanah,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文是关于CAV中多任务学习（MTL）的首个全面综述，介绍背景，探索其在关键功能模块应用，讨论现有方法优缺点并给出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法处理CAV多任务时成本高、计算开销大且难实时，MTL可在统一模型中联合学习多任务，提高效率和资源利用率，故开展此综述。

Method: 先介绍CAV和MTL基础背景，再探索MTL在感知、预测等关键功能模块的应用。

Result: 探讨了现有方法的优缺点，识别了关键研究差距。

Conclusion: 为推进CAV系统的MTL方法提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

TL;DR: 提出MoRe - ERL框架结合ERL和残差学习优化轨迹，实验表明残差学习效果好且模拟训练策略可部署到现实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预规划参考轨迹优化为安全、可行和高效的特定任务轨迹。

Method: MoRe - ERL框架结合ERL和残差学习，识别需修改的轨迹段，用B样条运动基元生成平滑残差调整。

Result: 残差学习在样本效率和任务性能上显著优于ERL从头训练，模拟训练的策略可直接部署到现实系统，模拟与现实差距小。

Conclusion: MoRe - ERL框架有效，能提升轨迹优化效果，且模拟训练策略可用于实际。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

TL;DR: 提出变分流匹配策略VFP解决传统流匹配方法多模态问题，在41个任务评估中展现效果和采样效率，成功率比基线提升49%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配方法在复杂操作任务中处理多模态有困难，常导致平均或模糊行为。

Method: 提出VFP，引入变分潜在先验进行模式感知动作生成，结合K-OT进行分布级对齐，使用MoE解码器进行模式专业化和高效推理。

Result: 在41个任务中评估，VFP任务成功率比标准流基线相对提高49%，保持快速推理和紧凑模型大小。

Conclusion: VFP在任务和路径多模态设置中有效且采样效率高。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合经典规划方法与大语言模型的技术在通用服务机器人应用上存在环境信息获取难和缺乏动态环境记忆的问题，需改进。

Method: 引入L3M+P框架，使用外部知识图谱表示世界状态，图谱可多源更新，执行格式规则保证一致性，规划时从图谱检索上下文生成问题定义。

Result: 在家庭机器人模拟器和真实服务机器人上评估，L3M+P在准确记录自然语言状态变化和正确生成规划方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: L3M+P框架通过知识图谱检索和验证，有效解决通用服务机器人规划难题。

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Conclusion: NaviMaster能有效统一GUI导航和具身导航，所采用策略和设计有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

Conclusion: CO - RFT算法在微调VLA模型上有效，能提升性能和具备良好的位置泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

TL;DR: 提出FedVLA框架解决VLA模型训练数据隐私和安全问题，经实验验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型训练依赖大规模用户特定数据，存在隐私和安全问题，限制广泛应用。

Method: 提出FedVLA框架，集成任务感知表示学习、自适应专家选择和专家驱动的联邦聚合；引入指令导向场景解析机制；设计双门控混合专家（DGMoE）机制；提出专家驱动聚合策略。

Result: DGMoE提高计算效率，FedVLA任务成功率与集中训练相当，有效保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedVLA框架能在不损失性能的前提下，有效保护数据隐私，可用于VLA模型的分布式训练。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 在物理人机协作中，为确保安全和促进有意义的工作流程，需对人机与物体的交互进行分析，过去的二元分类器不够详细，故研究三类人类/物体检测模型。

Method: 使用Franka Emika Panda机器人收集数据集，探索时间序列分析的预处理策略，在数据集上训练LSTM、GRU和Transformers等模型。

Result: 最佳模型在实时测试中达到91.11%的准确率，比较预处理策略发现滑动窗口方法最优。

Conclusion: 多类检测模型在物理人机协作的人类/物体检测中具有可行性。

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots
collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions
with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical
aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified.
Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish
between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by
evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed
contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot
manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis.
Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets.
The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing,
demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a
comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is
optimal for this task.

Result: HyCodePolicy显著提高了机器人操作策略的鲁棒性和样本效率。

Conclusion: HyCodePolicy为将多模态推理集成到自主决策管道提供了可扩展策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Motivation: 物联网设备计算能力有限采用协作DNN推理，信息交换存在隐私漏洞，需研究攻击手段。

Method: 提出基于对抗变分自编码器的AdVAR - DNN攻击，用分类器检测模型信息，VAE生成不可追踪的操作样本。

Result: 在CIFAR - 100数据集上对流行的对象分类DNN进行评估，攻击成功率高且几乎不会被检测到。

Conclusion: AdVAR - DNN攻击利用协作DNN推理敏感信息交换漏洞，效果显著。

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly
integral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing.
However, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the
adoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of
the inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often
requires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the
participants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel
privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial
variational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging
classifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable
manipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative
inference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange
vulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in
terms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is
partitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs
on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms
of high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究何种权重函数Γ(S,V,W)能使区块链在诚实方资源权重高于恶意方时，抵御私有双花攻击。

Method: 在理想“连续”模型和更现实的离散时间点模型中对权重函数进行分类研究。

Result: 在连续模型中，Γ(S,V,W)安全当且仅当它在定时资源V和W上是一次齐次的；在离散模型中，还需对S的依赖有温和假设。还指出不同PoW组合的其他安全权重函数。

Conclusion: 分类结果更通用，为设计新的最长链区块链提供强大工具，如不同PoW组合时某些权重函数在实践中是更好选择。

Abstract: The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went
into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a
majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the
highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to
secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of
space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a
VDF).
  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a
weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are
secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by
honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain
is secure against private double-spending attacks.
  We completely classify such functions in an idealized "continuous" model:
{\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only
if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,
{\alpha}{\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\Gamma}(S,{\alpha}V, {\alpha}W). This includes Bitcoin
rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic
model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs
some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not
grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).
  Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the
same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain
blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization,
say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to
use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using
{\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue
that in practice these are much better choices.

Motivation: 大语言模型代理动态非透明行为带来安全风险，尤其是提示注入攻击。

Method: 提出将代理运行时轨迹视为有可分析语义的结构化程序，构建AgentArmor框架，含图构造器、属性注册表和类型系统。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，TPR达95.75%，FPR为3.66%。

Conclusion: AgentArmor能检测提示注入漏洞并实施细粒度安全约束。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM技术在漏洞检测中存在深度分析困难、缺乏上下文信息和误判CWE等问题，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出多智能体LLM方法，分三步：多LLM智能体团队搜索潜在CWE，另一团队找相关外部上下文，最终智能体基于上下文决策。

Result: 在PrimeVul数据集，第一步40.9%正确识别CWE；在十个合成程序中，结合上下文显著减少误报，10个中有9个正确识别。

Conclusion: 提出的多智能体LLM方法在漏洞检测中识别CWE有良好效果。

Abstract: Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection
has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately,
state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even
distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to
three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs
often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques
typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability
detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus
on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but
associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead
developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the
challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a
team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the
function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external
context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes
informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered
context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In
the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\%
of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on
ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information
significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while

TL;DR: 现有静态分析工具难以检测小游戏代码深度混淆后的抄袭问题，提出动态分析框架JSidentify-V2并评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小游戏平台代码抄袭严重，现有静态分析工具难以应对复杂的深度混淆方法。

Method: 提出JSidentify-V2动态分析框架，采用四阶段流程：静态预分析与插桩、自适应热对象切片、构建内存依赖图、基于图的相似度分析。

Result: 在1200个小游戏的综合数据集上，针对八种混淆方法对JSidentify-V2进行评估。

Conclusion: 文档未明确给出，但推测JSidentify-V2在检测小游戏代码抄袭方面有较好效果。

Abstract: The explosive growth of mini-game platforms has led to widespread code
plagiarism, where malicious users access popular games' source code and
republish them with modifications. While existing static analysis tools can
detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code
injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as
encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely
destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis
ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel
dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing
memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while
obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory
behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage
pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential
memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution
coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to
represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based
similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.
  We evaluate JSidentify-V2 against eight obfuscation methods on a
comprehensive dataset of 1,200 mini-games ...

TL;DR: 提出用大语言模型自动生成测试网络协议实现序列的方法，在三种协议实现上评估，发现12个未知漏洞，证明方法有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协议测试构建马尔可夫模型需大量专业知识和人工，耗时且难扩展，需新方法。

Method: 定义协议可能状态集，让大语言模型选子集建模，生成状态序列代码作为序列生成器，生成测试输入。

Result: 在三种广泛使用的网络协议实现上评估，成功识别出12个先前未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的模糊测试框架在发现实际安全问题方面具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the
reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in
protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially
in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol
testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state
transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such
models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort,
making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse
protocols and implementations.
  We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations.
Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from
which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this
state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences
of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The
sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol
implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three
widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12
previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective
developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of
our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 文章引入新基准CUAHarm评估计算机使用代理（CUAs）的滥用风险，评估多种前沿语言模型，发现模型执行恶意任务成功率高，还评估了代理框架，探索监控方法但效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多未充分评估CUAs在完全访问计算机情况下的滥用风险，需新基准评估。

Method: 引入CUAHarm基准，包含104个专家编写的现实滥用风险，提供沙箱环境和基于规则的可验证奖励来衡量任务成功率，评估多种前沿语言模型和代理框架，探索用语言模型监控CUAs的行动和思维链。

Result: 前沿语言模型在执行恶意任务时成功率高，新模型滥用率更高，领先代理框架会放大滥用风险，监控CUAs比监控聊天机器人输出难，监控思维链效果有限。

Conclusion: CUAs存在显著安全风险，现有监控方法效果不佳，需更好的风险缓解策略。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠评估AI系统危险能力对确定其部署安全性至关重要，而模型或开发者的伪装行为是威胁，监控CoT推理是有前景的防御方法。

Method: 通过提示模型在对CoT监控不知情或知情的情况下进行伪装，测量模型在危险能力评估中对CoT监控的伪装能力。

Result: 前沿模型和小型开源模型可在无提示下零样本隐式伪装，但不可靠，监控感知时成功伪装后绕过监控的概率为16 - 36%。

Conclusion: 揭示了CoT监控的攻击面，给出五种隐式伪装策略，为CoT监控潜在失败模式提供信息，有助于构建更多样的伪装模型。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT - 4o自主解决初级进攻安全任务的能力。

Method: 将GPT - 4o连接到OverTheWire的Bandit夺旗游戏进行测试。

Result: 在25个技术上与单命令SSH框架兼容的关卡中，GPT - 4o独立解决18个，经提示又解决2个，成功率80%；擅长单步挑战，在多命令场景失败。

Conclusion: LLMs可自动化大量新手渗透测试工作流程，为攻防双方带来好处，未解决任务为安全加固提供方向，还可用于网络安全教育。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at

Motivation: RAG系统存在隐私和安全风险，现有防御策略存在可解释性有限、缺乏正式安全保证和易受自适应攻击等问题。

Method: 提出可证明安全的框架SAG，采用预存储全加密方案保护检索内容和向量嵌入，通过形式化安全证明验证方案在计算安全模型下的机密性和完整性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，框架能有效抵御一系列先进攻击。

Conclusion: 为可验证安全的RAG系统建立了理论基础和实践范式，推动AI服务向有正式安全保证的方向发展。

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

TL;DR: 本文提出四种针对Beta Poisoning攻击的防御策略，实验表明部分策略效果佳，并分析了不同参数下防御行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poisoning攻击威胁机器学习安全，Beta Poisoning会破坏模型准确性，需提出防御策略。

Method: 提出kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB)、Neighborhood Class Comparison (NCC)、Clustering-Based Defense (CBD)和Mean Distance Threshold (MDT)四种防御策略，基于对Beta Poisoning生成的中毒样本特征的观察。

Result: 使用MNIST和CIFAR - 10数据集实验，KPB和MDT能实现完美的准确率和F1分数，CBD和NCC也有较强防御能力。

Conclusion: 通过分析不同参数下的性能，为不同条件下防御策略的行为提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

Conclusion: BlockA2A和DOE能解决LLM驱动多智能体系统的安全问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DApp合约层攻击增多致660亿美元经济损失，未验证调用结果产生漏洞。

Method: 设计边缘预测、节点聚合、Conformer Block模块，结合图卷积网络检测漏洞。

Result: 审计608个DApp智能合约，UEChecker检测未检查外部调用漏洞准确率87.59%，优于GAT、LSTM和GCN基线模型。

Conclusion: UEChecker在检测未检查外部调用漏洞方面表现良好，准确率高且优于其他基线模型。

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Conclusion: 发布精细信任分数存在隐私风险，提出量化分数、校准噪声、混淆嵌入空间等对策。

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies,
has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

Motivation: 大语言模型在软件工程任务中结合运行时环境取得成功，但网络安全领域常缺乏此类环境，需新方法训练模型。

Method: 利用公开CTF记录，采用角色驱动的大语言模型模拟，逆向工程运行时行为，生成无实际环境的交互序列。

Result: 用Cyber - Zero合成的轨迹训练的模型在三个CTF基准测试中性能提升，Cyber - Zero - 32B达到新的先进水平。

Conclusion: 无运行时轨迹合成能有效推动先进网络安全代理的普及发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Motivation: 现有方法加密时忽略用户输入逻辑结构，导致数据效用降低和模型性能下降，需解决此局限以实现安全有效交互。

Method: 提出语义加密框架SE，包含语义编码和解码两部分，编码时用本地模型转换输入，解码时重构响应。

Result: SE有效保护数据隐私，不影响数据效用和用户体验，在各指标和数据集上优于InferDPT。

Conclusion: SE是与CLLMs安全交互的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

Motivation: 现有防御策略存在不足，检测方法依赖粗粒度特征统计，净化方法需全量重新训练或额外干净模型。

Method: 提出DUP框架，检测器利用类无关距离和层间转换捕捉特征异常，通过加权方案识别中毒输入；基于检测结果，用参数高效的遗忘机制净化模型，利用知识蒸馏引导学生模型对检测到的中毒样本增加与教师模型的输出差异。

Result: 在多种攻击方法和语言模型架构的实验中，DUP在检测精度和净化效果上取得了卓越的防御性能。

Conclusion: DUP框架能有效解决现有后门攻击防御策略的问题，实现更好的检测和净化效果。

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

Motivation: 解决合并的MoE模型中各专家知识产权归属和保护的未充分探索的问题。

Method: 设计专家路由指纹，构建RSF和RPF两种互补统计信息的专家级指纹，引入基于相似度的匹配算法。

Result: 在不同任务和CLIP - 基MoE架构上实验，对重用专家相似度高，与无关专家区分明显，对结构和参数篡改有鲁棒性，优于基于权重和激活的基线。

Conclusion: RouteMark为基于MoE的模型合并中的IP验证奠定了实用且广泛适用的基础。

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining
content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to
scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT
detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results
demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4)
% accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4
$\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity.
Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent
to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy
safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at

Result: 发现恶意应用为逃避检测减少权限请求，良性应用为增强功能增加请求，揭示不同应用权限使用模式有显著差异。

Conclusion: 应对权限滥用需持续监控、用户教育和监管。

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims
to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential
controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

Conclusion: FPEdit是首个同时实现抗适配鲁棒性、抗检测性和模型实用性的指纹方法，为对抗性部署场景下大语言模型的来源验证提供微创解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验证实了Coward的有效性以及对潜在自适应攻击的弹性。

Conclusion: Coward方法保留了主动防御处理数据异质性的优势，同时减轻了分布外偏差的不利影响。

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward
data security in LLMs.

Result: 基于作用的ML积分器消除了非结构保持ML预测器的病态行为，且可迭代应用，作为对计算成本较低的直接预测器的校正。

Conclusion: 学习数据驱动的结构保持映射是生成长时间步经典动力学的有效方法。

Abstract: The equations of classical mechanics can be used to model the time evolution
of countless physical systems, from the astrophysical to the atomic scale.
Accurate numerical integration requires small time steps, which limits the
computational efficiency -- especially in cases such as molecular dynamics that
span wildly different time scales. Using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to
predict trajectories allows one to greatly extend the integration time step, at
the cost of introducing artifacts such as lack of energy conservation and loss
of equipartition between different degrees of freedom of a system. We propose
learning data-driven structure-preserving (symplectic and time-reversible) maps
to generate long-time-step classical dynamics, showing that this method is
equivalent to learning the mechanical action of the system of interest. We show
that an action-derived ML integrator eliminates the pathological behavior of
non-structure-preserving ML predictors, and that the method can be applied
iteratively, serving as a correction to computationally cheaper direct
predictors.

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for
new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction
mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable
challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several
state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular
representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where
chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper
introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a
hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core,
Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes
3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a
3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two
pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and
reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a
progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With
prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional
performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task
prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10
datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing
methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.
This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular
computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic
reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism
understanding.

Method: 引入基于机器学习原子间势的FastCSP工作流，结合Genarris 3.0随机结构生成与UMA MLIP进行几何弛豫和自由能计算。

Result: 在28个刚性分子上测试，能生成已知实验结构并将其排在全局最小值5 kJ/mol范围内，表明通用MLIP无需特定系统调整。

Conclusion: UMA的速度和准确性使CSP早期无需经典力场，无需DFT最终重排，开源工作流降低CSP门槛，使高通量预测在多领域可行。

Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role
in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is
challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large
search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few
kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)
provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a
large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source,
high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with
geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the
Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of
28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently
generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per
molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs
can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning.
Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for
classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with
DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly
lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be
obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal
structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.

Method: 研究GTs和GPS网络在软注意力和平均硬注意力下的情况，分实数和浮点数两种场景研究。

Result: 实数场景下，GPS网络在一阶逻辑可定义的顶点属性上与带全局模态的分级模态逻辑（GML）表达能力相同；浮点数场景下，GPS网络与带计数全局模态的GML表达能力相同；GTs也有类似对应关系。

Conclusion: 明确了GTs和GPS网络在不同场景下的表达能力与相应逻辑的关系。

Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively
little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the
expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and
GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average
hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with
real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that
in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO),
GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with
the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally
expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is
absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We
also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic
with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for
floats).

Motivation: 未来网络需支持大量多样设备和应用，传统网络管理方法不足，自动化方案有误差，需网络数字孪生工具。

Method: 提出基于多层知识图谱架构和图神经网络的AI - NDT，评估四种图神经网络架构，用RIPE Atlas公开测量数据训练数字孪生。

Result: 四种评估架构中GraphTransformer性能最佳，其他架构在训练时间短场景也有可接受结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果暗示了主动式网络管理的常见做法，提供符合下一代网络要求的可扩展准确解决方案。

Abstract: Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of
interconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements.
While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated
solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone
to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to
learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins
are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI
models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents
an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered
knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network
metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation
of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was
conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We
trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE
Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world
applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated,
GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures
might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while
also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of
what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a
scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the
next-generation networks.

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks
is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial
observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with
Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage
connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links. Our key innovation is the
integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state
estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among
vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and
fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions.
Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant
configurations, demonstrate that MAAC-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art
terrestrial and satellite-assisted baselines by up to 14% in transmission
utility and maintains high estimation accuracy across varying vehicle densities
and sharing levels.

Method: 先系统比较卷积和Transformer，提出NetConv模型，采用堆叠流量卷积层，设计连续字节掩码预训练任务。

Conclusion: 卷积在加密流量分类预训练中有一定优势，NetConv模型能有效提高分类性能和模型吞吐量。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

Motivation: 多数先前工作假设纯随机生成模型，算法在现实扰动下可能脆弱，因此研究半随机模型。

Method: 确定半随机模型下检测的统计极限，设计新的计算高效且鲁棒的检测算法。

Result: 对于最大密度强亚对数的植入子图，在对手存在时检测在信息论上不可能；对于超对数密度子图，统计极限基本不变，最优似然比检验仍稳健。

Conclusion: 建立了首个鲁棒的植入子图检测框架，为半随机模型、计算 - 统计权衡和图推理问题的鲁棒性研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

Motivation: 现代电信系统定位引发隐私担忧，现有单天线发射机信号混淆策略仅对单天线接收机定位系统有效，需应对多天线接收机定位。

Method: 受盲多通道识别概念启发，提出多天线接收机CSI恢复方法，用实际信道测量对比评估信号混淆和恢复方法对不同定位技术性能的影响。

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果，但进行了对比评估。

Conclusion: 有必要进一步努力保护用户免受基于无线电的对抗性定位系统的位置隐私侵犯。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

Motivation: 解决现成大语言模型在地缘政治或战略场景中常建议升级行动的问题。

Method: 在实验性战争游戏设计中引入两种简单非技术干预措施。

Result: 在游戏中大幅降低了升级情况。

Conclusion: 限制大语言模型在国家安全应用中的使用还为时过早，应采取措施使其与国家安全目标对齐。

Abstract: U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models,
including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT)
familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent
studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest
escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We
demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these
tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame
design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the
game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security
applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will
continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting
courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study
acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides
actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including
escalation management.

Result: 广泛模拟和比较显示，在90%丢包率下MS - SSIM大于0.6，PSNR超过20 dB。

Conclusion: MSTVSC系统在抗丢包的视频语义通信中表现良好，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits
diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information
loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols,
packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing
erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a
packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication
(MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by
MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To
investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the
packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by
packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using
un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level
interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet
drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is
adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize
redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive
simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an
MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.

Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their
dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally
expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep
learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear
Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal
decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy
compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using
microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition,
we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode
essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in
the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition.
Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely
resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and
statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a
scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling
accelerated materials design and composition optimization.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The model of generalized automata, introduced by Eilenberg in 1974, allows
representing a regular language more concisely than conventional automata by
allowing edges to be labeled not only with characters, but also strings.
Giammaresi and Montalbano introduced a notion of determinism for generalized
automata [STACS 1995]. While generalized deterministic automata retain many
properties of conventional deterministic automata, the uniqueness of a minimal
generalized deterministic automaton is lost.
  In the first part of the paper, we show that the lack of uniqueness can be
explained by introducing a set $ \mathcal{W(A)} $ associated with a generalized
automaton $ \mathcal{A} $. By fixing $ \mathcal{W(A)} $, we are able to derive
for the first time a full Myhill-Nerode theorem for generalized automata, which
contains the textbook Myhill-Nerode theorem for conventional automata as a
degenerate case.
  In the second part of the paper, we show that the set $ \mathcal{W(A)} $
leads to applications for pattern matching and data compression. Wheeler
automata [TCS 2017, SODA 2020] are a popular class of automata that can be
compactly stored using $ e \log \sigma (1 + o(1)) + O(e) $ bits ($ e $ being
the number of edges, $ \sigma $ being the size of the alphabet) in such a way
that pattern matching queries can be solved in $ \tilde{O}(m) $ time ($ m $
being the length of the pattern). In the paper, we show how to extend these
results to generalized automata. More precisely, a Wheeler generalized automata
can be stored using $ \mathfrak{e} \log \sigma (1 + o(1)) + O(e + rn) $ bits so
that pattern matching queries can be solved in $ \tilde{O}(r m) $ time, where $
\mathfrak{e} $ is the total length of all edge labels, $ r $ is the maximum
length of an edge label and $ n $ is the number of states.

Conclusion: 该工作通过对声音特征的分层建模推进了语音病理分类，同时减少了性别偏差。

Abstract: AI-based voice analysis shows promise for disease diagnostics, but existing
classifiers often fail to accurately identify specific pathologies because of
gender-related acoustic variations and the scarcity of data for rare diseases.
We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific
pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs
gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through
multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged
dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time
warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC),
with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice
pathology classification while reducing gender bias through hierarchical
modeling of vocal characteristics.

Conclusion: BACH模型能有效解决现有歌曲生成方法的局限，是一种更优的歌曲生成方案。

Abstract: Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC;
nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent
limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and
duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing
paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task
that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we
present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly
designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH
introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored
to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in
the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation.
Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new
SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing
commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority across multiple subjective metrics.

Motivation: 提出自监督单音高估计方法，减少对标注数据依赖，提升模型性能与泛化能力。

Method: 采用孪生架构，处理VQT帧预测音高分布，用Toeplitz全连接层实现平移等变性，构建音高平移对，用基于类的转位等变目标训练。

Result: 模型参数少，在音乐和语音数据集上表现好，超越自监督基线，与监督方法竞争，有出色跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 开发可流式VQT实现，低延迟、参数少，使PESTO适合实时应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for
single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes
individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch
distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to
translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition,
we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and
train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,
eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and
training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very
lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets
(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms
self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting
superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical
utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached
convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and
minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time
applications.

Motivation: 现有符号音乐处理工具无法处理印度古典音乐的微音区别和拉格语法，需要新系统。

Method: 采用Shruti感知有限状态转换器（FST）进行音高序列校正，用语法约束的Shruti隐马尔可夫模型（GC - SHMM）完成旋律序列。

Result: ShrutiSense（FST模型）校正任务的什鲁蒂分类准确率达91.3%，在一定噪声下表现稳健，不同拉格中准确率保持稳定。

Conclusion: ShrutiSense系统能有效处理印度古典音乐的音高处理任务，保留其文化表达的真实性。

Abstract: Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22
shrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone
equal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to
account for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars
that govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic
pitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two
critical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and
(2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs
complementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state
transducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti
framework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that
incorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions.
Comprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that
ShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for
correction tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at
corruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under
pitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas
(90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical
music expression.

Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and
conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse
bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale
pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their
transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview
bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources
and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by
thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining
scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation
models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing
the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive
probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that
BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised
objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS,
BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model,
is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to
extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and
Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain
competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in
linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages
over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the
baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms
bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings
provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to
adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于ASR模型特征表示的新型鲁棒语音质量（SQ）预测器，在NISQA测试集上表现优于近期方法，领域适应性也更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来有很多开发基于神经网络的SQ预测器的研究，目标是开发非侵入式指标评估语音增强系统性能，也有研究在下游语音任务损失函数中直接推断神经SQ预测器。为辅助训练，创建了带人类质量标签的大型音频数据集。

Method: 提出基于从ASR模型提取的特征表示的新型SQ预测器。

Result: 该系统在所有NISQA测试集上与人类平均意见得分（MOS）评级的相关性高于近期方法，与常用的DNSMOS指标相比，领域适应性显著更好。

Conclusion: 基于ASR模型特征表示的SQ预测器是有效的，在性能和领域适应性上有优势。

Abstract: There has been significant research effort developing neural-network-based
predictors of SQ in recent years. While a primary objective has been to develop
non-intrusive, i.e.~reference-free, metrics to assess the performance of SE
systems, recent work has also investigated the direct inference of neural SQ
predictors within the loss function of downstream speech tasks. To aid in the
training of SQ predictors, several large datasets of audio with corresponding
human labels of quality have been created. Recent work in this area has shown
that speech representations derived from large unsupervised or semi-supervised
foundational speech models are useful input feature representations for neural
SQ prediction. In this work, a novel and robust SQ predictor is proposed based
on feature representations extracted from an ASR model, found to be a powerful
input feature for the SQ prediction task. The proposed system achieves higher
correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches on all NISQA test
sets and shows significantly better domain adaption compared to the commonly
used DNSMOS metric.

TL;DR: 研究通过丹麦参与者语音数据，用不同模型分析，发现语音分析对慢性阻塞性肺疾病（COPD）筛查有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COPD严重影响全球数百万人，早期非侵入性检测可改善患者生活质量和预后，需验证语音作为生物标志物在不同语言群体中的有效性。

Method: 收集96名丹麦参与者三种语音任务（阅读、咳嗽、持续元音）的音频数据，一半为不同程度COPD患者，一半为健康对照组，用openSMILE特征和学习的x - vector嵌入研究不同基线模型。

Result: 使用openSMILE特征和逻辑回归获得了67%的最佳准确率。

Conclusion: 支持基于语音的分析作为非侵入性、远程和可扩展的筛查工具，可用于未来COPD医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a serious and debilitating
disease affecting millions around the world. Its early detection using
non-invasive means could enable preventive interventions that improve quality
of life and patient outcomes, with speech recently shown to be a valuable
biomarker. Yet, its validity across different linguistic groups remains to be
seen. To that end, audio data were collected from 96 Danish participants
conducting three speech tasks (reading, coughing, sustained vowels). Half of
the participants were diagnosed with different levels of COPD and the other
half formed a healthy control group. Subsequently, we investigated different
baseline models using openSMILE features and learnt x-vector embeddings. We
obtained a best accuracy of 67% using openSMILE features and logistic
regression. Our findings support the potential of speech-based analysis as a
non-invasive, remote, and scalable screening tool as part of future COPD
healthcare solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多仅在话语级别分类口吃，而检测和分割口吃对言语治疗和实时反馈至关重要。

Method: 引入StutterCut半监督框架，将口吃分割建模为图划分问题，用伪神谕分类器细化节点连接，控制其影响；扩展FluencyBank数据集。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验表明，StutterCut的F1分数更高，口吃起始检测更精确。

Conclusion: StutterCut框架在口吃分割任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detecting and segmenting dysfluencies is crucial for effective speech therapy
and real-time feedback. However, most methods only classify dysfluencies at the
utterance level. We introduce StutterCut, a semi-supervised framework that
formulates dysfluency segmentation as a graph partitioning problem, where
speech embeddings from overlapping windows are represented as graph nodes. We
refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained
on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an
uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the
weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency
boundaries for four dysfluency types. This provides a more realistic benchmark
compared to synthetic datasets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that StutterCut outperforms existing methods, achieving higher F1 scores and
more precise stuttering onset detection.

Motivation: 现有扩散方法增加采样步骤提升音频质量受限于采样过程随机性，性能有限。

Method: 提出推理时间缩放范式，开发任务特定验证器，引入随机搜索和零阶搜索两种算法，通过验证器 - 算法组合引导高维解空间探索。

Result: 在不同音频领域和频率范围验证，语音超分辨率在美学、说话人相似度、字错误率和频谱距离等指标有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能实现更稳健、更高质量的音频输出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks,
including audio super-resolution (SR). In many applications like movie
post-production and album mastering, substantial computational budgets are
available for achieving superior audio quality. However, while existing
diffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the
performance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the
sampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs. Here,
rather than simply increasing the number of sampling steps, we propose a
different paradigm through inference-time scaling for SR, which explores
multiple solution trajectories during the sampling process. Different
task-specific verifiers are developed, and two search algorithms, including the
random search and zero-order search for SR, are introduced. By actively guiding
the exploration of the high-dimensional solution space through
verifier-algorithm combinations, we enable more robust and higher-quality
outputs. Through extensive validation across diverse audio domains (speech,
music, sound effects) and frequency ranges, we demonstrate consistent
performance gains, achieving improvements of up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88%
in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral
distance for speech SR from 4kHz to 24kHz, showcasing the effectiveness of our
approach. Audio samples are available at:

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for
Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise
conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement
task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The
model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the
proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or
masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further
introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and
efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show
consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the
baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech
enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust
speech processing.

TL;DR: 传统太阳能辐照度预测误差指标有缺陷，本文提出NICEk框架评估预测模型，经评估其优于传统指标，有更强统计显著性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准误差指标无法捕捉太阳能辐照度预测的多维特性，不适用于实际操作，需新评估方法。

Method: 引入NICEk框架，用蒙特卡罗模拟和西班牙SIAR网络68个站点数据评估自回归模型、极限学习和智能持久性等方法。

Result: 理论和实证结果相符，NICESigma判别能力更强，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: NICEk指标有更强统计显著性和泛化性，是确定性太阳能预测中标准误差指标的统一且实用替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate solar energy output prediction is key for integrating renewables
into grids, maintaining stability, and improving energy management. However,
standard error metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
Error (MAE), and Skill Scores (SS) fail to capture the multidimensional nature
of solar irradiance forecasting. These metrics lack sensitivity to
forecastability, rely on arbitrary baselines (e.g., clear-sky models), and are
poorly suited for operational use.
  To address this, we introduce the NICEk framework (Normalized Informed
Comparison of Errors, with k = 1, 2, 3, Sigma), offering a robust and
interpretable evaluation of forecasting models. Each NICEk score corresponds to
an Lk norm: NICE1 targets average errors, NICE2 emphasizes large deviations,
NICE3 highlights outliers, and NICESigma combines all.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and data from 68 stations in the Spanish SIAR
network, we evaluated methods including autoregressive models, extreme
learning, and smart persistence. Theoretical and empirical results align when
assumptions hold (e.g., R^2 ~ 1.0 for NICE2). Most importantly, NICESigma
consistently shows higher discriminative power (p < 0.05), outperforming
traditional metrics (p > 0.05).
  The NICEk metrics exhibit stronger statistical significance (e.g., p-values
from 10^-6 to 0.004 across horizons) and greater generalizability. They offer a
unified and operational alternative to standard error metrics in deterministic
solar forecasting.

Motivation: 探究关税在具有非位似偏好和部门互补性的经济中，除贸易保护外对产业结构和福利的影响。

Method: 定性刻画关税影响机制，并使用定量动态模型进行分析。

Result: 2001 年起美国制造业关税提高 20 个百分点，制造业增加值份额提高 1 个百分点，福利增加 0.36%；若贸易伙伴互惠回应，美国福利下降 0.12%。

Conclusion: 关税能通过改变相对价格和收入水平影响产业结构和福利，贸易伙伴的回应会改变关税政策效果。

Abstract: We examine how tariffs affect sectoral composition and welfare in an economy
with nonhomothetic preferences and sectors being complements -- key drivers of
structural change. Beyond their conventional role in trade protection, tariffs
influence industrial structure by altering relative prices and income levels.
We qualitatively characterize these mechanisms and use a quantitative dynamic
model to show that a counterfactual 20-percentage-point increase in U.S.
manufacturing tariffs since 2001 would have raised the manufacturing
value-added share by one percentage point and increased welfare by 0.36
percent. However, if all the U.S. trading partners responded reciprocally, U.S.
welfare would decline by 0.12 percent.

Conclusion: 讨论了ABCD设计对推进实验社会科学的潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in any study of the effects of beliefs on outcomes, such
as decisions and behavior, is the risk of omitted variables bias. Omitted
variables, frequently unmeasured or even unknown, can induce correlations
between beliefs and decisions that are not genuinely causal, in which case the
omitted variables are referred to as confounders. To address the challenge of
causal inference, researchers frequently rely on information provision
experiments to randomly manipulate beliefs. The information supplied in these
experiments can serve as an instrumental variable (IV), enabling causal
inference, so long as it influences decisions exclusively through its impact on
beliefs. However, providing varying information to participants to shape their
beliefs can raise both methodological and ethical concerns. Methodological
concerns arise from potential violations of the exclusion restriction
assumption. Such violations may stem from information source effects, when
attitudes toward the source affect the outcome decision directly, thereby
introducing a confounder. An ethical concern arises from manipulating the
provided information, as it may involve deceiving participants. This paper
proposes and empirically demonstrates a new method for treating beliefs and
estimating their effects, the Anchoring-Based Causal Design (ABCD), which
avoids deception and source influences. ABCD combines the cognitive mechanism
known as anchoring with instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Instead of
providing substantive information, the method employs a deliberately
non-informative procedure in which participants compare their self-assessment
of a concept to a randomly assigned anchor value. We present the method and the
results of eight experiments demonstrating its application, strengths, and
limitations. We conclude by discussing the potential of this design for
advancing experimental social science.

following the break. Employing a novel method for structural break analysis
within interactive effects panel data, we demonstrate that the break in retail
payment models is due to COVID-19, and the break in the wholesale payment model
is associated with the central bank's payment system policy.

Abstract: Behavioural finance offers a valuable framework for examining foreign
exchange (FX) market dynamics, including puzzles such as excess volatility and
fat-tailed distributions. Yet, when it comes to their interaction with the
`real' side of the economy, existing scholarship has overlooked a critical
feature of developing countries. They cannot trade in their national currencies
and need US dollars to access modern production techniques as well as maintain
consumption patterns similar to those of wealthier societies. To address this
gap, we present a novel heterogeneous agents model from the perspective of a
developing economy that distinguishes between speculative and non-speculative
sectors in the FX market. We demonstrate that as long as non-speculative demand
responds to domestic economic activity, a market-clearing output growth rate
exists that, in steady-state, is equal to the ratio between FX supply growth
and the income elasticity of demand for foreign assets, i.e., a generalised
dynamic trade-multiplier. Numerical simulations reproduce key stylised facts of
exchange rate dynamics and economic growth, including distributions that
deviate from the typical bell-shaped curve. Data from a sample of Latin
American countries reveal that FX fluctuations exhibit similar statistical
properties. Furthermore, we employ time-varying parameter estimation techniques
to show that the dynamic trade-multiplier closely tracks observed growth rates
in these economies.

Abstract: Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset
ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May
2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide
low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized
finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted
extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in
Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National
Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins
Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across
economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design,
evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a
multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary
literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial
structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a
performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs,
supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and
reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization
illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in
cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical
tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a
stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case
linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and
datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development
of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.

Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements
intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle
fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall
utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization
does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with
exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when
dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This
contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that
determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is
addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that
transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both
approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which
shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with
significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational
performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet
management.

Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical
operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding
aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel
continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this
integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,
our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional
discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked
against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is
demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational
results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to
proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40
aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all
tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly
outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic
benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between
solution time and optimality.

Abstract: One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest
vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a
non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and
work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries
and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that
this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest
absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The
algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a
threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value
determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity
norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In
particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given
polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.

Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful
balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic
Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but
their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms.
Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly
from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in
estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural
Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model
with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are
then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step.
In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that
replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and
succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN.
Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible,
improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using
explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a
versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve
forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for
computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture
solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn
multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a
pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated
under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the
model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a
unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to
capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial
relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular
representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements,
including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on
the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1%
in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling
and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further
demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of
0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and
advancing structure-based drug design.
