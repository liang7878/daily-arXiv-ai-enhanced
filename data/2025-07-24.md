### [1] [Towards Autonomous Sustainability Assessment via Multimodal AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17012)
*Zhihan Zhang,Alexander Metzger,Yuxuan Mei,Felix Hähnlein,Zachary Englhardt,Tingyu Cheng,Gregory D. Abowd,Shwetak Patel,Adriana Schulz,Vikram Iyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多模态AI代理重新构想传统LCA，可计算电子设备碳排放，还开发直接估算环境影响和生成排放因子的方法，分析其扩展性和对未来LCA工作流的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来对可持续性信息兴趣增加，但LCA所需数据常缺失，因此需新方法解决。

Method: 引入多模态AI代理，利用自定义数据抽象和软件工具提取信息计算碳排放；通过与相似产品对比直接估算环境影响；用数据驱动方法根据未知材料属性生成排放因子。

Result: 计算碳排放方法将专家时间从数周或数月减至不到一分钟，碳足迹估算与专家LCA误差在19%内；直接估算环境影响方法在笔记本电脑上运行时间3ms，MAPE为12.28%；生成排放因子方法比专家选择提高MAPE 120.26%。

Conclusion: 该方法能解决数据可用性问题，可应用于未来LCA工作流。

Abstract: Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However,
the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and
processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts
(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing
multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and
stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the
cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI
agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom
data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text
and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach
reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data
availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of
expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to
directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with
similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop
with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven
method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown
material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar
materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,
this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this
approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.

### [2] [New Mechanisms in Flex Distribution for Bounded Suboptimal Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17054)
*Shao-Hung Chan,Thomy Phan,Jiaoyang Li,Sven Koenig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文聚焦多智能体路径规划（MAPF）中EECBS算法，指出原灵活分配方法效率问题，提出基于冲突、延迟及混合策略的灵活分配机制，证明其完备性和有界次优性，实验表明新方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原EECBS算法使用灵活分配提高阈值时，会使路径成本总和超出界限，导致算法在不同路径集间切换，降低效率，需改进。

Method: 提出基于冲突的灵活分配，按冲突数量分配灵活性；估计满足约束所需延迟，提出基于延迟的灵活分配；结合二者提出混合策略灵活分配。

Result: 实验显示新的灵活分配机制比原（贪婪）灵活分配表现更优。

Conclusion: EECBS算法结合新的灵活分配机制具有完备性和有界次优性，新机制有效提升算法性能。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of
collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective
is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent
is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.
Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for
bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a
user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and
a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of
paths whose SOC is at most $w \cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve
collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its
optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually
bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower
bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up
EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though
EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,
increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \cdot LB$, forcing EECBS
to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a
particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,
we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion
to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy
constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we
propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical
framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is
complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches
outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.

### [3] [LoRA is All You Need for Safety Alignment of Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17075)
*Yihao Xue,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出安全对齐微调会降低大语言模型推理能力，提出用LoRA在拒绝数据集上进行SFT可有效实现安全对齐且不损害推理能力，实验证明有效，并探索减少权重更新重叠的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决安全对齐微调导致大语言模型推理能力下降的“安全税”问题。

Method: 使用LoRA在拒绝数据集上进行SFT，将安全权重更新限制在低秩空间；探索通过正则化或权重合并减少权重更新与初始权重重叠的方法。

Result: 该方法能产生高安全性的大语言模型，安全水平与全模型微调相当且不损害推理能力；LoRA权重更新与初始权重重叠更小，探索的方法在某些任务上有改进。

Conclusion: 希望该结果能推动设计在推理 - 安全权衡上更稳定改进的方法。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex
problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with
harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the
post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been
shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the
"Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets
effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning
capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a
low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our
extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding
show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels
comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with
smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We
also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or
during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope
this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent
improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.

*Mandar Pitale,Jelena Frtunikj,Abhinaw Priyadershi,Vasu Singh,Maria Spence*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文回顾架构方案、评估安全分析方法，提出HySAFE - AI框架，并对未来AI安全标准发展给出建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在安全关键领域日益重要，当前自主系统架构趋向端到端整体架构，需评估和改进安全分析方法。

Method: 回顾不同架构方案，评估常见安全分析方法，针对基础模型特性改进这些技术，提出HySAFE - AI混合框架。

Result: 展示了如何改进传统安全分析技术以适应基础模型，提出HySAFE - AI框架。

Conclusion: 给出未来工作提示和引导未来AI安全标准发展的建议。

Abstract: AI has become integral to safety-critical areas like autonomous driving
systems (ADS) and robotics. The architecture of recent autonomous systems are
trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large
language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we
review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of
common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and
fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the
intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and
utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety
Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts
traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer
hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety
standards.

### [5] [Improving LLMs' Generalized Reasoning Abilities by Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17168)
*Qifan Zhang,Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Miao Peng,Jing Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用图问题推理（GPR）增强大语言模型（LLM）通用推理能力，引入GraphPile数据集，在多模型上训练GraphMind取得更好推理效果，弥合特定领域预训练与通用推理能力的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在新的复杂问题上表现不佳，特定领域持续预训练方法缺乏可迁移性，需要提升通用推理能力。

Method: 使用GPR增强LLM通用推理能力，引入GraphPile数据集，在Llama 3、3.1和Gemma 2等基础模型上训练GraphMind。

Result: 在数学推理中准确率最高提升4.9%，在非数学推理任务中提升最高达21.2%。

Conclusion: 首次利用GPR增强推理模式并引入相关数据集，弥合特定领域预训练和通用推理能力的差距，提高了LLM的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks,
yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems.
Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for
mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader
reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning
(GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks,
spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological
reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them
ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce
GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR
data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes
chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph
data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and
3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in
mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical
reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first
to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first
dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific
pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability
and robustness of LLMs.

### [7] [Agent Identity Evals: Measuring Agentic Identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17257)
*Elija Perrier,Michael Timothy Bennett*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出语言模型代理（LMA）存在身份问题，提出代理身份评估（AIE）框架来衡量其代理身份的维持情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMA继承了大语言模型的缺陷，影响其身份的稳定性，进而削弱可靠性、可信度和实用性，因此需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 引入AIE框架，包含一组新颖的指标，给出可应用于LMA生命周期各阶段的正式定义和方法，并给出应用示例。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents
(LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time.
However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs)
(statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and
linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability,
continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode
their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their
agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these
challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous,
statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an
LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including
their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations.
AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of
performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of
optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out
formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA
life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

### [8] [CQE under Epistemic Dependencies: Algorithms and Experiments (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17487)
*Lorenzo Marconi,Flavia Ricci,Riccardo Rosati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究基于本体的受控查询评估（CQE），结合认知依赖（EDs）与最优GA审查器概念，分析交集方法安全性，给出重写算法并证明复杂度，通过实验验证可行性。


<details>

Motivation: 在本体的CQE中，用EDs调节信息披露，确保查询回答的安全性并具备良好计算性能。

Method: 结合EDs与最优GA审查器，分析交集方法安全性，针对特定子类EDs和DL - Lite_R本体给出一阶重写算法。

Result: 确定交集方法对全EDs安全，证明特定情况下回答布尔联合查询的数据复杂度为AC^0，实验验证重写函数可行。

Conclusion: 所提方法在保证安全性的同时具备良好计算性能和实际可行性。

Abstract: We investigate Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE) over ontologies, where
information disclosure is regulated by epistemic dependencies (EDs), a family
of logical rules recently proposed for the CQE framework. In particular, we
combine EDs with the notion of optimal GA censors, i.e. maximal sets of ground
atoms that are entailed by the ontology and can be safely revealed. We focus on
answering Boolean unions of conjunctive queries (BUCQs) with respect to the
intersection of all optimal GA censors - an approach that has been shown in
other contexts to ensure strong security guarantees with favorable
computational behavior. First, we characterize the security of this
intersection-based approach and identify a class of EDs (namely, full EDs) for
which it remains safe. Then, for a subclass of EDs and for DL-Lite_R
ontologies, we show that answering BUCQs in the above CQE semantics is in AC^0
in data complexity by presenting a suitable, detailed first-order rewriting
algorithm. Finally, we report on experiments conducted in two different
evaluation scenarios, showing the practical feasibility of our rewriting
function.

TL;DR: 开发基于ChatGPT - 4o - mini的聊天机器人SCRIPT支持编程新手学习，实验评估发现学生反馈请求有特定顺序，聊天机器人响应契合学生需求且符合系统提示约束，为GenAI学习支持系统设计提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前生成式AI在编程教育方面的研究，开发工具支持编程新手学习。

Method: 开发基于ChatGPT - 4o - mini的聊天机器人SCRIPT，在德国一所大学的编程入门课程中对136名学生进行实验，分析学生解决编程任务时与SCRIPT的交互及反馈偏好。

Result: 学生反馈请求有特定顺序，75%的聊天机器人响应契合学生反馈类型，且符合系统提示约束。

Conclusion: 研究结果为GenAI学习支持系统设计提供依据，指出AI辅助工具平衡指导与灵活性的挑战。

Abstract: Building on prior research on Generative AI (GenAI) and related tools for
programming education, we developed SCRIPT, a chatbot based on ChatGPT-4o-mini,
to support novice learners. SCRIPT allows for open-ended interactions and
structured guidance through predefined prompts. We evaluated the tool via an
experiment with 136 students from an introductory programming course at a large
German university and analyzed how students interacted with SCRIPT while
solving programming tasks with a focus on their feedback preferences. The
results reveal that students' feedback requests seem to follow a specific
sequence. Moreover, the chatbot responses aligned well with students' requested
feedback types (in 75%), and it adhered to the system prompt constraints. These
insights inform the design of GenAI-based learning support systems and
highlight challenges in balancing guidance and flexibility in AI-assisted
tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出合规大脑助手CBA，设计用户查询路由器平衡响应质量和延迟，实验表明CBA性能优于普通大语言模型，路由机制有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高企业环境中人员日常合规任务的效率。

Method: 设计用户查询路由器，分快速模式处理简单请求、全智能模式处理复杂请求。

Result: CBA在平均关键词匹配率和大语言模型评判通过率等指标上大幅优于普通大语言模型，路由设计平衡效果好。

Conclusion: 路由机制能在响应质量和延迟之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational,
agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks
for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between
response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can
intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that
only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and
(ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite
actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various
compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating
requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its
description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to
query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.
  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on
various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various
personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's
performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and
LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full
routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and
found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the
run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the
routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic
settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry,
Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world
context. Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity,
and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain
shift without simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人工标注情况下，实现大语言模型与人类意图和安全规范的高质量对齐是挑战，因此提出解决方案。

Method: UDASA框架为每个输入生成多个响应，从语义、事实性和价值对齐三个维度量化输出不确定性，构建偏好对，将训练样本按不确定性差异分为三个阶段并逐步优化模型。

Result: UDASA在无害性、有用性、真实性和受控情感生成等多任务上优于现有对齐方法，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: UDASA框架能有效提升大语言模型的对齐效果，具有较好的应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
instruction following and general-purpose reasoning. However, achieving
high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human
annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an
Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to
improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates
multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across
three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these
uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes
training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory,
according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized
progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of
preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong
empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that
UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including
harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation,
significantly improving model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号人工智能方法多用于静态场景，很少探索需要时间维度推理的具有挑战性的场景。

Method: 引入LTLZinc基准框架，从线性时间逻辑规范、MiniZinc约束和任意图像分类数据集生成表达性的时间推理和持续学习任务，支持多种训练设置。

Result: 在LTLZinc生成的任务上的实验展示了时间学习和推理的挑战性，凸显了当前最先进方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 发布LTLZinc生成器和任务，希望促进统一的时间学习和推理框架的研究。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures
with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable
formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge
over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned
concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial
intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting
where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom
explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can
be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against
which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the
temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive
temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic
specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification
datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic
training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six
neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks
generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning
and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods.
We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the
neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering
research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: The grounding bottleneck poses one of the key challenges that hinders the
widespread adoption of Answer Set Programming in industry. Hybrid Grounding is
a step in alleviating the bottleneck by combining the strength of standard
bottom-up grounding with recently proposed techniques where rule bodies are
decoupled during grounding. However, it has remained unclear when hybrid
grounding shall use body-decoupled grounding and when to use standard bottom-up
grounding. In this paper, we address this issue by developing automated hybrid
grounding: we introduce a splitting algorithm based on data-structural
heuristics that detects when to use body-decoupled grounding and when standard
grounding is beneficial. We base our heuristics on the structure of rules and
an estimation procedure that incorporates the data of the instance. The
experiments conducted on our prototypical implementation demonstrate promising

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing
research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as
mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real
world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of
multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning
skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this
gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the
RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a
comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO
algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the
models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities
when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the
intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge
during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence
of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base
and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we
delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts
of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and
language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer
significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing
key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning
performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL
methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TAI Scan Tool, a RAG-based TAI self-assessment tool
with minimalistic input. The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI
assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI

risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time
retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their
obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields
promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant
articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of
results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting
of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring
careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.

Method: 引入FundusExpert，构建FundusGen数据集，通过Fundus - Engine系统自动化定位和语义扩展，构建临床对齐的认知链。

Result: FundusExpert在眼科问答任务中超越40B MedRegA平均准确率26.6%，在零样本报告生成任务临床一致性达77.0%，优于GPT - 4o的47.6%，揭示数据质量与模型能力的缩放定律。

Conclusion: 通过整合区域定位和诊断推理链，开发了可扩展、临床对齐的MLLM，探索了弥合特定MLLM视觉 - 语言差距的途径。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in
the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the
intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and
leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable
reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,
achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with
diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned
MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific
MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.

Motivation: 社会生态系统理解需多元利益相关者视角，但获取不易，因此开发模拟框架来探索。

Method: 开发HoPeS框架，利用大语言模型驱动的代理代表利益相关者，使用模拟协议支持视角转换，开发原型系统进行实验。

Result: 实验中用户扮演不同角色，政策推荐和实施存在差异，用户有挫败感但仍有动力探索新策略。

Conclusion: 系统有探索不同视角的潜力，进一步完善系统和协议有望促进社会生态模拟中的跨学科合作。

Abstract: Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse
stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable
alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder
perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)
modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models
(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles
to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a
"scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting
users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across
perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the
context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both
narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a
user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher
- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform
evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various
institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound
policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and
implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world
misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's
reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment
as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political
neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user
exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing
strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different
perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new
forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a
vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time
decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users.
This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach,
where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to
artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess
broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with
real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic
agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty
steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers
supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and
implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,
and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We
further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on
a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show
that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone
LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy
with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of
82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world
testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and
resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.
Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the
symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven
networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even
as LLMs advance.

Motivation: 近期实证研究表明LRMs的思维过程可能无法提升推理能力，本文探究引入工具增强后LRMs的局限性是否依然存在。

Method: 引入Python解释器和草稿纸两种工具，在Apple的基准推理谜题上评估三个代表性大语言模型及其LRM对应模型。

Result: 合理使用工具时，LRMs在所有任务复杂度级别上始终优于非推理对应模型。

Conclusion: 挑战了推理是一种错觉的观点，强调了工具增强的LRMs在解决复杂问题上的潜力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large
language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a
step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle
complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g.,
[Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not
actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning
actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we
revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist
when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools,
Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and
their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show
that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the
recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of
tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.

Abstract: Research communities have developed benchmark datasets across domains to
compare the performance of algorithms and techniques However, tracking the
progress in these research areas is not easy, as publications appear in
different venues at the same time, and many of them claim to represent the
state-of-the-art. To address this, research communities often organise periodic
competitions to evaluate the performance of various algorithms and techniques,
thereby tracking advancements in the field. However, these competitions pose a
significant operational burden. The organisers must manage and evaluate a large
volume of submissions. Furthermore, participants typically develop their
solutions in diverse environments, leading to compatibility issues during the
evaluation of their submissions. This paper presents an online competition
system that automates the submission and evaluation process for a competition.
The competition system allows organisers to manage large numbers of submissions
efficiently, utilising isolated environments to evaluate submissions. This
system has already been used successfully for several competitions, including
the Grid-Based Pathfinding Competition and the League of Robot Runners
competition.

Abstract: Accurate road damage detection is crucial for timely infrastructure
maintenance and public safety, but existing vision-only datasets and models
lack the rich contextual understanding that textual information can provide. To
address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark
for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution
images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer
context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language
model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It
includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of
road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the
model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data
generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly
increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments
demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage
recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by
19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual
information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for
the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning, essential in organic synthesis and drug discovery,
has greatly benefited from recent AI-driven advancements. Nevertheless,
existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and
explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often
lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither
consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we
introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed
specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement
learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly
enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind
human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical
utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts
multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world
drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit
reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing
trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.

Motivation: 现有主题计数方法存在局限性，期望通过引入阈值一阶逻辑从网络中挖掘更丰富信息。

Result: FOLTY理论运行时间与稀疏图中时态三角形计数的最佳已知运行时间相匹配，在商品硬件上能在不到一小时内处理近7000万条边的图的三元组FOL查询。

Conclusion: 工作有望开启主题分析经典问题的新研究方向。

Abstract: Motif counting is a fundamental problem in network analysis, and there is a
rich literature of theoretical and applied algorithms for this problem. Given a
large input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small "pattern" graph indicative of
special local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of
this pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif
counting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a "triadic" query. Recent
work has focused on "temporal graph mining", where the network $G$ has edges
with timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.
  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of
"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis" for massive temporal
networks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three
vertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An "FOL" motif query is obtained
by having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows
for query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical
triadic query would be "find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they
form a triangle within one hour". A thresholded FOL query can express "find all
pairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$
also formed an edge within an hour".
  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic
queries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running
time for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient
implementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has
excellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with
nearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware. Our work has the
potential to start a new research direction in the classic well-studied problem
of motif analysis.

Result: 提供了工具功能与数据质量维度的全面映射，展示了功能对单一维度评估的部分贡献。

Conclusion: 该系统调查为从业者和研究者提供了数据质量检查的统一视角，为多维度质量评估提供可操作见解。

Abstract: Data quality describes the degree to which data meet specific requirements
and are fit for use by humans and/or downstream tasks (e.g., artificial
intelligence). Data quality can be assessed across multiple high-level concepts
called dimensions, such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, or timeliness.
While extensive research and several attempts for standardization (e.g.,
ISO/IEC 25012) exist for data quality dimensions, their practical application
often remains unclear. In parallel to research endeavors, a large number of
tools have been developed that implement functionalities for the detection and
mitigation of specific data quality issues, such as missing values or outliers.
With this paper, we aim to bridge this gap between data quality theory and
practice by systematically connecting low-level functionalities offered by data
quality tools with high-level dimensions, revealing their many-to-many
relationships. Through an examination of seven open-source data quality tools,
we provide a comprehensive mapping between their functionalities and the data
quality dimensions, demonstrating how individual functionalities and their
variants partially contribute to the assessment of single dimensions. This
systematic survey provides both practitioners and researchers with a unified
view on the fragmented landscape of data quality checks, offering actionable
insights for quality assessment across multiple dimensions.

Result: 达到与单机HNSW相同的准确性，评估证实方法的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决分离式内存中ANN搜索的问题，具有良好的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in
computer science for which in-memory graph-based methods, such as Hierarchical
Navigable Small World (HNSW), perform exceptionally well. To scale beyond
billions of high-dimensional vectors, the index must be distributed. The
disaggregated memory architecture physically separates compute and memory into
two distinct hardware units and has become popular in modern data centers. Both
units are connected via RDMA networks that allow compute nodes to directly
access remote memory and perform all the computations, posing unique challenges
for disaggregated indexes.
  In this work, we propose a scalable HNSW index for ANN search in
disaggregated memory. In contrast to existing distributed approaches, which
partition the graph at the cost of accuracy, our method builds a
graph-preserving index that reaches the same accuracy as a single-machine HNSW.
Continuously fetching high-dimensional vector data from remote memory leads to
severe network bandwidth limitations, which we overcome by employing an
efficient caching mechanism. Since answering a single query involves processing
numerous unique graph nodes, caching alone is not sufficient to achieve high
scalability. We logically combine the caches of the compute nodes to increase
the overall cache effectiveness and confirm the efficiency and scalability of
our method in our evaluation.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optimizing parallel programs for distributed heterogeneous systems remains a
complex task, often requiring significant code modifications. Task-based
programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from
core application logic, but their mapping interfaces are often too low-level.
In this work, we introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming
interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation
primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between iteration and processor
spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication
volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple
mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including
six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads,
Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14X and enables performance improvements of
up to 1.34X over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose
primitive achieves up to 1.83X improvement over existing
dimensionality-resolution heuristics. These results demonstrate that Mapple
simplifies the development of high-performance mappers for distributed
applications.

Conclusion: PathWeaver是一种可扩展且高效的多GPU框架，能加速大规模数据集的图近似最近邻搜索。

Abstract: Graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is widely adopted in
numerous applications, such as recommendation systems, natural language
processing, and computer vision. While recent works on GPU-based acceleration
have significantly advanced ANNS performance, the ever-growing scale of
datasets now demands efficient multi-GPU solutions. However, the design of
existing works overlooks multi-GPU scalability, resulting in naive approaches
that treat additional GPUs as a means to extend memory capacity for large
datasets. This inefficiency arises from partitioning the dataset and
independently searching for data points similar to the queries in each GPU. We
therefore propose PathWeaver, a novel multi-GPU framework designed to scale and
accelerate ANNS for large datasets. First, we propose pipelining-based path
extension, a GPU-aware pipelining mechanism that reduces prior work's redundant
search iterations by leveraging GPU-to-GPU communication. Second, we design
ghost staging that leverages a representative dataset to identify optimal query
starting points, reducing the search space for challenging queries. Finally, we
introduce direction-guided selection, a data selection technique that filters
irrelevant points early in the search process, minimizing unnecessary memory
accesses and distance computations. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse
datasets demonstrate that PathWeaver achieves 3.24$\times$ geomean speedup and
up to 5.30$\times$ speedup on 95% recall rate over state-of-the-art
multi-GPU-based ANNS frameworks.

TL;DR: 传统业务向大语言模型（LLM）解决方案转型，但推理资源需求大、延迟高。本文提出BucketServe框架优化性能，实验表明其吞吐量、负载处理能力等优于对比方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统使用静态或连续批处理策略，在异构工作负载下GPU内存利用率低、延迟高，难以适应动态工作负载波动，导致吞吐量不佳和SLO违规。

Method: 提出BucketServe框架，将请求按序列长度分组至大小同质的桶，实时调整批大小优化GPU内存使用，引入自适应桶拆分/合并和优先级感知调度。

Result: BucketServe吞吐量比UELLM最多提升3.58倍；在80% SLO达标情况下比DistServe多处理1.93倍请求负载；系统负载容量比UELLM高1.975倍。

Conclusion: BucketServe框架能有效优化LLM推理性能，提升吞吐量和系统负载能力，确保SLO合规。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various
areas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to
LLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or
latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing
LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which
can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency,
especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to
adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and
potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce
BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM
inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based
on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU
memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory
(OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and
priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO
compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM
in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more
request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and
demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.

Abstract: The interactions within cloud-native applications are complex, with a
constantly changing number of services and loads, posing higher demands on
auto-scaling approach. This mainly involves several challenges such as
microservices dependency analysis, performance profiling, anomaly detection,
workload characterization and task co-location. Therefore, some advanced
algorithms have been investigated into auto-scaling cloud-native applications
to optimize system and application performance. These algorithms can learn from
historical data and appropriately adjust resource allocation based on the
current environment and load conditions to optimize resource utilization and
system performance. In this paper, we systematically review the literature on
state-of-the-art auto-scaling approaches for cloud-native applications from
2020, and further explore the technological evolution. Additionally, we propose
a detailed taxonomy to categorize current research from five perspectives,
including infrastructure, architecture, scaling methods, optimization
objectives, and behavior modeling. Then, we provide a comprehensive comparison
and in-depth discussion of the key features, advantages, limitations, and
application scenarios of each approach, considering their performance in
diverse environments and under various conditions. Finally, we summarize the
current state of research in this field, identify the gaps and unresolved
challenges, and emphasize promising directions for future exploration,
particularly in areas such as the application of large models, microservice
dependency management, and the use of meta-learning techniques to enhance model
applicability and adaptability across different environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MoE的大语言模型系统因静态模型放置和缺乏动态工作负载适应，存在效率低、资源利用不佳和延迟增加问题。

Method: 引入整合多专家知识的“联合专家”减少专家访问次数和推理延迟，提出动态降级机制自适应调整令牌处理。

Result: 在各种工作负载下，与vLLM相比吞吐量最高提升2.07倍，SLO违规减少90.28%，保持可接受推理准确性。

Conclusion: BrownoutServe框架能在动态计算需求和流量条件下优化MoE架构大语言模型推理效率并维持服务可靠性。

Abstract: In recent years, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely
applied to large language models (LLMs), providing a promising solution that
activates only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, thereby
reducing overall memory requirements and allowing for faster inference compared
to dense models. Despite these advantages, existing systems still face issues
of low efficiency due to static model placement and lack of dynamic workloads
adaptation. This leads to suboptimal resource utilization and increased
latency, especially during bursty requests periods.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces BrownoutServe, a novel
serving framework designed to optimize inference efficiency and maintain
service reliability for MoE-based LLMs under dynamic computational demands and
traffic conditions. BrownoutServe introduces "united experts" that integrate
knowledge from multiple experts, reducing the times of expert access and
inference latency. Additionally, it proposes a dynamic brownout mechanism to
adaptively adjust the processing of certain tokens, optimizing inference
performance while guaranteeing service level objectives (SLOs) are met. Our
evaluations show the effectiveness of BrownoutServe under various workloads: it
achieves up to 2.07x throughput improvement compared to vLLM and reduces SLO
violations by 90.28%, showcasing its robustness under bursty traffic while
maintaining acceptable inference accuracy.

Motivation: 深度学习框架中权重剪枝可提升计算效率，卷积操作常是CNN性能瓶颈，且剪枝效果依赖实现方式。

Method: 提出列级N:M剪枝策略，修改XNNPACK；融合im2col和数据打包操作；使用AITemplate分析技术确定卷积操作最优实现。

Result: ResNet推理吞吐量最多提升4.0x，ImageNet top - 1准确率与密集模型基线相比损失控制在2.1%以内。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升RISC - V架构上卷积操作效率并保证一定准确率。

Abstract: In deep learning frameworks, weight pruning is a widely used technique for
improving computational efficiency by reducing the size of large models. This
is especially critical for convolutional operators, which often act as
performance bottlenecks in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the
effectiveness of pruning heavily depends on how it is implemented, as different
methods can significantly impact both computational performance and memory
footprint. In this work, we propose a column-wise N:M pruning strategy applied
at the tile level and modify XNNPACK to enable efficient execution of pruned
models on the RISC-V vector architecture. Additionally, we propose fusing the
operations of im2col and data packing to minimize redundant memory accesses and
memory overhead. To further optimize performance, we incorporate AITemplate's
profiling technique to identify the optimal implementation for each
convolutional operator. Our proposed approach effectively increases ResNet
inference throughput by as much as 4.0x, and preserves ImageNet top-1 accuracy
within 2.1\% of the dense baseline.

Result: ILP方法能找到比结合经典调度算法和内存管理策略的基线好得多的解决方案。

Conclusion: ILP方法在解决2级内存层次多处理器上通用计算DAG调度问题上有更好的效果。

Abstract: We study the problem of scheduling a general computational DAG on multiple
processors in a 2-level memory hierarchy. This setting is a natural
generalization of several prominent models in the literature, and it
simultaneously captures workload balancing, communication, and data movement
due to cache size limitations. We first analyze the fundamental properties of
this problem from a theoretical perspective, such as its computational
complexity. We also prove that optimizing parallelization and memory management
separately, as done in many applications, can result in a solution that is a
linear factor away from the optimum.
  On the algorithmic side, we discuss a natural technique to represent and
solve the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We develop a holistic
scheduling algorithm based on this approach, and we experimentally study its
performance and properties on a small benchmark of computational tasks. Our
results confirm that the ILP-based method can indeed find considerably better
solutions than a baseline which combines classical scheduling algorithms and
memory management policies.

Result: 算法达到最优的ℓ∞估计误差，在字RAM模型中运行时间为严格的O(n ln ln d)，优于之前已知的确定性时间界O(n²)。

Conclusion: 提出的算法解决了打破二次障碍的开放问题。

Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that releases a pure differentially private sparse
histogram over $n$ participants drawn from a domain of size $d \gg n$. Our
method attains the optimal $\ell_\infty$-estimation error and runs in strictly
$O(n \ln \ln d)$ time in the word-RAM model, thereby improving upon the
previous best known deterministic-time bound of $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and resolving
the open problem of breaking this quadratic barrier (Balcer and Vadhan, 2019).
Central to our algorithm is a novel private item blanket technique with
target-length padding, which transforms the approximate differentially private
stability-based histogram algorithm into a pure differentially private one.

Method: 研究在任意度量空间中选择k个设施服务客户的问题，考虑四个不同目标。

Conclusion: 选择设施或代表委员会时，有可能同时满足多个目标。

Abstract: We study a version of the metric facility location problem (or, equivalently,
variants of the committee selection problem) in which we must choose $k$
facilities in an arbitrary metric space to serve some set of clients $C$. We
consider four different objectives, where each client $i\in C$ attempts to
minimize either the sum or the maximum of its distance to the chosen
facilities, and where the overall objective either considers the sum or the
maximum of the individual client costs. Rather than optimizing a single
objective at a time, we study how compatible these objectives are with each
other, and show the existence of solutions which are simultaneously
close-to-optimum for any pair of the above objectives. Our results show that
when choosing a set of facilities or a representative committee, it is often
possible to form a solution which is good for several objectives at the same
time, instead of sacrificing one desideratum to achieve another.

Result: 实验显示该方法在运行时间和门复杂度上显著优于现有方法，大规模量子态可扩展性更好，最佳情况有指数级提升。

Conclusion: 提出的QSP算法有显著优势，是对之前工作的扩展，新增三个算法。

Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computing
and quantum information processing. It is critical to the execution of many
quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper,
we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers
of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single
ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our algorithms
are based on a novel decision diagram that is fundamentally different from the
approaches used in previous QSP algorithms. Specifically, our approach exploits
the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly
compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and
decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and
exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of
runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential
improvement in best-case scenarios. This paper is an extended version of [1],
with three more algorithms proposed.

Motivation: 现有定位查询在评估函数Φ时有实际瓶颈，需通过后缀数组的压缩表示提升定位查询速度。

Method: 采用Relative Lempel - Ziv和LZ - End两种压缩方案增强r - index和Move - r，并进行实验评估定位查询性能。

Result: 实验显示r - index和Move - r的定位查询可显著加速，尤其是模式出现次数多时。

Conclusion: 两种压缩方案为索引大小和查询性能提供了新的权衡选择。

Abstract: In pattern matching on strings, a locate query asks for an enumeration of all
the occurrences of a given pattern in a given text. The r-index [Gagie et al.,
2018] is a recently presented compressed self index that stores the text and
auxiliary information in compressed space. With some modifications, locate
queries can be answered in optimal time [Nishimoto & Tabei, 2021], which has
recently been proven relevant in practice in the form of Move-r [Bertram et
al., 2024]. However, there remains the practical bottleneck of evaluating
function $\Phi$ for every occurrence to report. This motivates enhancing the
index by a compressed representation of the suffix array featuring efficient
random access, trading off space for faster answering of locate queries
[Puglisi & Zhukova, 2021]. In this work, we build upon this idea considering
two suitable compression schemes: Relative Lempel-Ziv [Kuruppu et al., 2010],
improving the work by Puglisi and Zhukova, and LZ-End [Kreft & Navarro, 2010],
introducing a different trade-off where compression is better than for Relative
Lempel-Ziv at the cost of slower access times. We enhance both the r-index and
Move-r by the compressed suffix arrays and evaluate locate query performance in
an experiment. We show that locate queries can be sped up considerably in both
the r-index and Move-r, especially if the queried pattern has many occurrences.
The choice between two different compression schemes offers new trade-offs
regarding index size versus query performance.

Motivation: 经典先知不等式基础上提出残差先知不等式问题，考虑移除前k个值后剩余值的选择问题。

Method: 针对FI和NI两种模型设计随机算法，对k = 1的独立同分布实例构建单阈值算法。

Result: FI模型随机算法竞争比至少为1/(k + 2)且是紧的；NI模型算法竞争比为1/(2k + 2)；k = 1独立同分布实例单阈值算法竞争比至少0.4901，且单阈值策略竞争比不超0.5464。

Conclusion: 成功设计算法解决RPI问题，给出不同情况下的竞争比结果。

Abstract: We introduce a variant of the classic prophet inequality, called
\emph{residual prophet inequality} (RPI). In the RPI problem, we consider a
finite sequence of $n$ nonnegative independent random values with known
distributions, and a known integer $0\leq k\leq n-1$. Before the gambler
observes the sequence, the top $k$ values are removed, whereas the remaining
$n-k$ values are streamed sequentially to the gambler. For example, one can
assume that the top $k$ values have already been allocated to a higher-priority
agent. Upon observing a value, the gambler must decide irrevocably whether to
accept or reject it, without the possibility of revisiting past values.
  We study two variants of RPI, according to whether the gambler learns online
of the identity of the variable that he sees (FI model) or not (NI model). Our
main result is a randomized algorithm in the FI model with \emph{competitive
ratio} of at least $1/(k+2)$, which we show is tight. Our algorithm is
data-driven and requires access only to the $k+1$ largest values of a single
sample from the $n$ input distributions. In the NI model, we provide a similar
algorithm that guarantees a competitive ratio of $1/(2k+2)$. We further analyze
independent and identically distributed instances when $k=1$. We build a
single-threshold algorithm with a competitive ratio of at least 0.4901, and
show that no single-threshold strategy can get a competitive ratio greater than
0.5464.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the behavior of large-scale multi-agents in
games remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper
examines the role of heterogeneity in equilibrium formation by analyzing how
smooth regret-matching drives a large number of heterogeneous agents with
diverse initial policies toward unified behavior. By modeling the system state
as a probability distribution of regrets and analyzing its evolution through
the continuity equation, we uncover a key phenomenon in diverse multi-agent
settings: the variance of the regret distribution diminishes over time, leading
to the disappearance of heterogeneity and the emergence of consensus among
agents. This universal result enables us to prove convergence to quantal
response equilibria in both competitive and cooperative multi-agent settings.
Our work advances the theoretical understanding of multi-agent learning and
offers a novel perspective on equilibrium selection in diverse game-theoretic
scenarios.

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，在HotpotQA数据集上ROUGE - 1得分64.98%，超BGE - Rerank方法9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: QMKGF方法有效且具有优越性。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising
paradigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content
generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies
primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching
methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This
limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF,
a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing
Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ
general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a
knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a
multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations,
multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the
semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query.
Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores
subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we
select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples
from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query.
Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are
utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic
representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF
on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA
dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\%, surpassing the
BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\% to 64.98\%).
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF
approach.

Result: 在热门在线视频平台数据上实验表明，该方法能以最小努力有效可控地减少不良推荐。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可有效控制个性化推荐中的不良内容。

Abstract: Recommenders are significantly shaping online information consumption. While
effective at personalizing content, these systems increasingly face criticism
for propagating irrelevant, unwanted, and even harmful recommendations. Such
content degrades user satisfaction and contributes to significant societal
issues, including misinformation, radicalization, and erosion of user trust.
Although platforms offer mechanisms to mitigate exposure to undesired content,
these mechanisms are often insufficiently effective and slow to adapt to users'
feedback. This paper introduces an intuitive, model-agnostic, and
distribution-free method that uses conformal risk control to provably bound
unwanted content in personalized recommendations by leveraging simple binary
feedback on items. We also address a limitation of traditional conformal risk
control approaches, i.e., the fact that the recommender can provide a smaller
set of recommended items, by leveraging implicit feedback on consumed items to
expand the recommendation set while ensuring robust risk mitigation. Our
experimental evaluation on data coming from a popular online video-sharing
platform demonstrates that our approach ensures an effective and controllable
reduction of unwanted recommendations with minimal effort. The source code is

Conclusion: LLM4MEA方法有效，同时提出简单有效的防御策略，确定可降低MEA风险的推荐系统关键超参数。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of sequential recommender
systems to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). MEAs collect responses from
recommender systems to replicate their functionality, enabling unauthorized
deployments and posing critical privacy and security risks. Black-box attacks
in prior MEAs are ineffective at exposing recommender system vulnerabilities
due to random sampling in data selection, which leads to misaligned synthetic
and real-world distributions. To overcome this limitation, we propose LLM4MEA,
a novel model extraction method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as
human-like rankers to generate data. It generates data through interactions
between the LLM ranker and target recommender system. In each interaction, the
LLM ranker analyzes historical interactions to understand user behavior, and
selects items from recommendations with consistent preferences to extend the
interaction history, which serves as training data for MEA. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LLM4MEA significantly outperforms existing
approaches in data quality and attack performance, reducing the divergence
between synthetic and real-world data by up to 64.98% and improving MEA
performance by 44.82% on average. From a defensive perspective, we propose a
simple yet effective defense strategy and identify key hyperparameters of
recommender systems that can mitigate the risk of MEAs.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation
platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding.
However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in
e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global
image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to
suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where
product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal
matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not
generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we
propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating
Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent
for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image
representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances
textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach
significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,
and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the
largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by
15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework
outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in
both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining
object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust
multimodal recommendations.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to alleviate the data sparsity by
transferring knowledge across domains. Disentangled representation learning
provides an effective solution to model complex user preferences by separating
intra-domain features (domain-shared and domain-specific features), thereby
enhancing robustness and interpretability. However, disentanglement-based CDR
methods employing generative modeling or GNNs with contrastive objectives face
two key challenges: (i) pre-separation strategies decouple features before
extracting collaborative signals, disrupting intra-domain interactions and
introducing noise; (ii) unsupervised disentanglement objectives lack explicit
task-specific guidance, resulting in limited consistency and suboptimal
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DGCDR, a GNN-enhanced
encoder-decoder framework. To handle challenge (i), DGCDR first applies GNN to
extract high-order collaborative signals, providing enriched representations as
a robust foundation for disentanglement. The encoder then dynamically
disentangles features into domain-shared and -specific spaces, preserving
collaborative information during the separation process. To handle challenge
(ii), the decoder introduces an anchor-based supervision that leverages
hierarchical feature relationships to enhance intra-domain consistency and
cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DGCDR achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements
of up to 11.59% across key metrics. Qualitative analyses further validate its
superior disentanglement quality and transferability. Our source code and
datasets are available on GitHub for further comparison.

Abstract: Harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems has
emerged as a prominent avenue, drawing substantial research interest. However,
existing approaches primarily involve basic prompt techniques for knowledge
acquisition, which resemble System-1 thinking. This makes these methods highly
sensitive to errors in the reasoning path, where even a small mistake can lead
to an incorrect inference. To this end, in this paper, we propose $R^{4}$ec, a
reasoning, reflection and refinement framework that evolves the recommendation
system into a weak System-2 model. Specifically, we introduce two models: an
actor model that engages in reasoning, and a reflection model that judges these
responses and provides valuable feedback. Then the actor model will refine its
response based on the feedback, ultimately leading to improved responses. We
employ an iterative reflection and refinement process, enabling LLMs to
facilitate slow and deliberate System-2-like thinking. Ultimately, the final
refined knowledge will be incorporated into a recommendation backbone for
prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on Amazon-Book and MovieLens-1M
datasets to demonstrate the superiority of $R^{4}$ec. We also deploy $R^{4}$ec
on a large scale online advertising platform, showing 2.2\% increase of
revenue. Furthermore, we investigate the scaling properties of the actor model
and reflection model.

Abstract: Serendipity plays a pivotal role in enhancing user satisfaction within
recommender systems, yet its evaluation poses significant challenges due to its
inherently subjective nature and conceptual ambiguity. Current algorithmic
approaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often
failing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large
language models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies
across various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core
research proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity
evaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two
datasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains,
focusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional
proxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the
efficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that
even the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the
performance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the
incorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human
perspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a
Pearson correlation coefficient of 21.5\% when compared to the results of the
user study. This research implies that LLMs may serve as potentially accurate
and cost-effective evaluators, introducing a new paradigm for serendipity
evaluation in recommender systems.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality,
underscoring the importance of timely polyp detection and diagnosis. While deep
learning models have improved optical-assisted diagnostics, they often demand
extensive labeled datasets and yield "black-box" outputs with limited
interpretability. In this paper, we propose EndoFinder, an online polyp
retrieval framework that leverages multi-view scene representations for
explainable and scalable CRC diagnosis. First, we develop a Polyp-aware Image
Encoder by combining contrastive learning and a reconstruction task, guided by
polyp segmentation masks. This self-supervised approach captures robust
features without relying on large-scale annotated data. Next, we treat each
polyp as a three-dimensional "scene" and introduce a Scene Representation
Transformer, which fuses multiple views of the polyp into a single latent
representation. By discretizing this representation through a hashing layer,
EndoFinder enables real-time retrieval from a compiled database of historical
polyp cases, where diagnostic information serves as interpretable references
for new queries. We evaluate EndoFinder on both public and newly collected
polyp datasets for re-identification and pathology classification. Results show
that EndoFinder outperforms existing methods in accuracy while providing
transparent, retrieval-based insights for clinical decision-making. By
contributing a novel dataset and a scalable, explainable framework, our work
addresses key challenges in polyp diagnosis and offers a promising direction
for more efficient AI-driven colonoscopy workflows. The source code is

Conclusion: 公布专有数据和模型源代码以推动该领域未来研究。

Abstract: On music streaming services, listening sessions are often composed of a
balance of familiar and new tracks. Recently, sequential recommender systems
have adopted cognitive-informed approaches, such as Adaptive Control of
Thought-Rational (ACT-R), to successfully improve the prediction of the most
relevant tracks for the next user session. However, one limitation of using a
model inspired by human memory (or the past), is that it struggles to recommend
new tracks that users have not previously listened to. To bridge this gap, here
we propose a model that leverages audio information to predict in advance the
ACT-R-like activation of new tracks and incorporates them into the
recommendation scoring process. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of
the proposed model using proprietary data, which we publicly release along with
the model's source code to foster future research in this field.

Abstract: Recent advances in citation recommendation have improved accuracy by
leveraging multi-view representation learning to integrate the various
modalities present in scholarly documents. However, effectively combining
multiple data views requires fusion techniques that can capture complementary
information while preserving the unique characteristics of each modality. We
propose a novel citation recommendation algorithm that improves upon linear
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods by applying Deep CCA (DCCA), a
neural network extension capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships
between distributed textual and graph-based representations of scientific
articles. Experiments on the large-scale DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library
Project) citation network dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art CCA-based methods, achieving relative improvements of over 11%
in Mean Average Precision@10, 5% in Precision@10, and 7% in Recall@10. These
gains reflect more relevant citation recommendations and enhanced ranking
quality, suggesting that DCCA's non-linear transformations yield more
expressive latent representations than CCA's linear projections.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决跨域推荐中的非重叠用户偏见问题，代码公开可获取。

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods predominantly leverage overlapping
users to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. However,
through empirical studies, we uncover a critical bias inherent in these
approaches: while overlapping users experience significant enhancements in
recommendation quality, non-overlapping users benefit minimally and even face
performance degradation. This unfairness may erode user trust, and,
consequently, negatively impact business engagement and revenue. To address
this issue, we propose a novel solution that generates virtual source-domain
users for non-overlapping target-domain users. Our method utilizes a dual
attention mechanism to discern similarities between overlapping and
non-overlapping users, thereby synthesizing realistic virtual user embeddings.
We further introduce a limiter component that ensures the generated virtual
users align with real-data distributions while preserving each user's unique
characteristics. Notably, our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated into any CDR model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three
public datasets with five CDR baselines demonstrate that our method effectively
mitigates the CDR non-overlapping user bias, without loss of overall accuracy.

Abstract: The quality of a transtibial prosthetic socket depends on the prosthetist's
skills and expertise, as the fitting is performed manually. This study
investigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help
standardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were
collected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data
consists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a
corresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data
pre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and
optionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.
Afterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural
network, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final
socket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the
socket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's
performance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the
AI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.
First, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface
error between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.
Second, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are
utilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the
required adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.
The random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest
error with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first
quartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) have shown promise to accelerate materials
discovery by integrating machine learning with automated experimental
platforms. However, errors in the capture of input parameters may corrupt the
features used to model system performance, compromising current and future
campaigns. This study develops an automated workflow to systematically detect
noisy features, determine sample-feature pairings that can be corrected, and
finally recover the correct feature values. A systematic study is then
performed to examine how dataset size, noise intensity, and feature value
distribution affect both the detectability and recoverability of noisy
features. In general, high-intensity noise and large training datasets are
conducive to the detection and correction of noisy features. Low-intensity
noise reduces detection and recovery but can be compensated for by larger clean
training data sets. Detection and correction results vary between features with
continuous and dispersed feature distributions showing greater recoverability
compared to features with discrete or narrow distributions. This systematic
study not only demonstrates a model agnostic framework for rational data
recovery in the presence of noise, limited data, and differing feature
distributions but also provides a tangible benchmark of kNN imputation in
materials data sets. Ultimately, it aims to enhance data quality and
experimental precision in automated materials discovery.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of
energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the
need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the
key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size
of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data
continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple
locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated
Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw
data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to
the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),
computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a
data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on
reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.
Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated
datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,
and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We
develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric
factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon
emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive
recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,
minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to
time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the
environmental impact of FL tasks.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence,
with applications ranging from mathematical problem-solving to decision-making
in dynamic environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in
enabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term
rewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks
due to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state
representations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer
architectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these
challenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic
Transformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages
hyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present
theoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that
include Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL
with vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by
(32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by
(16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control
benchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in
reinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that
involve hierarchical structures.

Abstract: This paper introduces DiffCarl, a diffusion-modeled carbon- and risk-aware
reinforcement learning algorithm for intelligent operation of multi-microgrid
systems. With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system
complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time
energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a
diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable
adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon
emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a
denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and
enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid
environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms
classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower
operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of
its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results
highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible
design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and
objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.

Abstract: Recent work has identified non-compact symmetric spaces U/H as a promising
class of homogeneous manifolds to develop a geometrically consistent theory of
neural networks. An initial implementation of these concepts has been presented
in a twin paper under the moniker of Cartan Neural Networks, showing both the
feasibility and the performance of these geometric concepts in a machine
learning context. The current paper expands on the mathematical structures
underpinning Cartan Neural Networks, detailing the geometric properties of the
layers and how the maps between layers interact with such structures to make
Cartan Neural Networks covariant and geometrically interpretable. Together,
these twin papers constitute a first step towards a fully geometrically
interpretable theory of neural networks exploiting group-theoretic structures

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率编码引入的高斯噪声会扭曲分类任务中点距离测量，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出CPE方法，采用置信感知机制调整距离计算，用L2正则化项替代基于KL散度的方差正则化。

Result: 在自然语言分类任务的BERT和RoBERTa模型上显著提升性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提CPE方法有效，能解决概率编码在分类任务中的问题，且与模型无关。

Abstract: Probabilistic encoding introduces Gaussian noise into neural networks,
enabling a smooth transition from deterministic to uncertain states and
enhancing generalization ability. However, the randomness of Gaussian noise
distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE)
method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning.
Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First,
we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations,
ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification
tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance
regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2
regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is
model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification
tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and
generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.

TL;DR: 现有生成模型采样计算成本高，本文提出基于区间分割一致性的SplitMeanFlow训练框架，更高效通用，在语音合成中提速20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型如Flow Matching迭代采样过程计算成本高的问题，改进现有学习平均速度场的方法。

Method: 回归平均速度的基本原理，利用定积分可加性，推导出区间分割一致性的代数恒等式，构建SplitMeanFlow训练框架。

Result: 证明MeanFlow的微分恒等式是区间分割趋于无穷小时的特例；代数方法更高效，实现简单、训练稳定、硬件兼容性广；在语音合成产品中提速20倍。

Conclusion: SplitMeanFlow是学习平均速度场更直接、更通用的基础，具有实际应用优势。

Abstract: Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art
performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative
sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or
one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps
noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by
enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous
velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a
limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first
principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite
integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term
Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential
relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals
without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we
introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic
consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the
differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit
of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This
establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning
average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is
significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,
resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware
compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been
successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as
Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.

Result: 在总模型训练预算增加不到0.1%的情况下，在多个现代基准测试中大幅超越领先的量化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法易跨模型架构泛化，可用于激活、缓存和权重，除量化外无需引入额外操作。

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency,
model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience
at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss
of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring
mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we
demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that,
with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms
the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern
benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily
generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to
activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional
operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

Motivation: 现有异构分割学习框架常忽略个性化隐私需求和不同环境下的本地模型定制，本文旨在解决这些局限。

Method: 设计个性化顺序分割学习管道，采用双层优化技术让客户端确定最优个性化分割点且不向服务器共享敏感信息。

Result: 在包含7个设备的测试平台上，使用不同模型架构和数据集在不同环境条件下实现并评估了P3SL。

Conclusion: P3SL能让客户端实现定制化隐私保护和维护个性化本地模型，平衡能耗和隐私泄露风险并保持高模型精度。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning
technique that enables resource constrained edge devices to participate in
model training by partitioning a model into client-side and server-side
sub-models. While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it
encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices
vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental
conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored
heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying
resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and
local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split
Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device
systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a
personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to
achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models
tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and
privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers
clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without
sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,
environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach
balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high
model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7
devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop,
using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental
conditions.

Conclusion: 为HRL和外骨骼未来发展提供了新见解，有助于在不同行走环境中安全过渡和通行。

Abstract: Rehabilitation technology is a natural setting to study the shared learning
and decision-making of human and machine agents. In this work, we explore the
use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control
strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy
for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of
biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down
the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level
framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for
providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the
continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal
abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors,
including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated
two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy
network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control
system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As
a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs
increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were
seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns,
terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This
suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during
uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified.
This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the
future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and
traversing across different walking environments.

Result: 在ADNI和MNIST数据集实验表明，该方法比量子联邦平均法性能更好、更稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的QFL算法能有效解决联邦学习的部分挑战，且结合Fisher信息有积极效果。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become increasingly popular across different
sectors, offering a way for clients to work together to train a global model
without sharing sensitive data. It involves multiple rounds of communication
between the global model and participating clients, which introduces several
challenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged
processing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent
years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits
has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for
fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of
quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance
model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that
Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state
carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric
and statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the
aforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated
Learning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on
local client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.
This approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence
the quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the
aggregation process. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of
QFL by comparing its performance against other variants, and exploring the
benefits of incorporating Fisher information in QFL settings. Experimental
results on ADNI and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving better performance and robustness against the quantum
federated averaging method.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在低数据场景有过拟合、隐私泄露等问题，基于大模型的上下文学习有新隐私风险且在表格合成中风险程度不明。

Method: 对三个基础模型和四个基线模型在35个真实表格上进行基准测试，评估统计保真度、下游实用性和成员推理泄露情况。

Result: 基础模型隐私风险始终最高，LLaMA 3.3 70B风险显著高于基线，CTGAN和GPT - 4o - mini有较好权衡，提示调整可降低风险并保持高保真度。

Conclusion: 基准测试为使用基础模型进行更安全的低数据合成提供实用指南。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is essential for machine learning workflows,
especially for expanding small or imbalanced datasets and enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing. However, state-of-the-art generative models
(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of
examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic
data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent
retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows
via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no
parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,
introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity
of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a
person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three
foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four
baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate
statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.
Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.
LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at
1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly
vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and
GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three
zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary
statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up
to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a
practical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.

Conclusion: 方法具有鲁棒性和适应性

Abstract: Most existing methods for adapting models to out-of-distribution (OOD)
domains rely on invariant representation learning to eliminate the influence of
biased features. However, should bias always be eliminated -- and if not, when
should it be retained, and how can it be leveraged? To address these questions,
we first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under
which biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on
this theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically
leverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The
framework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and
indirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive
ingredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the
environmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware
predictors to alleviate environment gaps. We validate our approach through
experiments on both synthetic datasets and standard domain generalization
benchmarks. Results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, underscoring its robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified approach for designing stochastic optimization
algorithms that robustly scale to the federated learning setting. Our work
studies a class of Majorize-Minimization (MM) problems, which possesses a
linearly parameterized family of majorizing surrogate functions. This framework
encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth
objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as
variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying
algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (\SSMM),
which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then
extend \SSMM\ to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common
bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and
communication constraints; this yields \QSMM. The originality of \QSMM\ is to
learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the
\textit{surrogate majorizing function}, contrary to classical algorithms which
learn and aggregate the \textit{original parameter}. Finally, to showcase the
flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to
design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated
setting.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to time

This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with
fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series,
marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to
convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel
application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic
understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model.
The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the
complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results
confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting
model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets.
This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using

Conclusion: 提出的模型有一定优势，通过实验多种性能指标得以体现。

Abstract: Dual discriminator generative adversarial networks (D2 GANs) were introduced
to mitigate the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks. In
D2 GANs, two discriminators are employed alongside a generator: one
discriminator rewards high scores for samples from the true data distribution,
while the other favors samples from the generator. In this work, we first
introduce dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs), which combines
the strengths of dual discriminators with the flexibility of a tunable loss
function, $\alpha$-loss. We further generalize this approach to arbitrary
functions defined on positive reals, leading to a broader class of models we
refer to as generalized dual discriminator generative adversarial networks. For
each of these proposed models, we provide theoretical analysis and show that
the associated min-max optimization reduces to the minimization of a linear
combination of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence. This generalizes
the known simplification for D2-GANs, where the objective reduces to a linear
combination of the KL-divergence and the reverse KL-divergence. Finally, we
perform experiments on 2D synthetic data and use multiple performance metrics
to capture various advantages of our GANs.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification and inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) are central to a wide range of scientific and
engineering applications. In this second part of a two part series, we extend
Bilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) for PDE-constrained optimization
problems developed in Part 1 to the Bayesian inference framework. At the lower
level, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by
minimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural
network. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior
distribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with
existing methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the
challenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights
and does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network
solution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the
PDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method
improves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty
quantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC
sampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact
minimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between
the tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the
resulting uncertainty quantification. Through numerical experiments across a
variety of PDE models, we demonstrate that our method delivers accurate
inference and quantification of uncertainties while maintaining high
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 结构化可压缩性和鲁棒性之间存在根本冲突，为设计高效安全模型提供新途径。

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

TL;DR: 本文提出从行为策略的可解释模型中推导治疗策略，解决离线强化学习在安全关键领域应用的挑战，在实际案例中表现优于当前实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在安全关键领域因可解释性和评估问题限制了实际应用，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过可解释的行为策略模型估计每个患者状态下最常选择的动作来推导治疗策略，使用基于树的模型对状态进行分组。

Result: 使用类风湿关节炎和脓毒症护理的真实案例，证明该框架下推导的策略能优于当前实践。

Conclusion: 该实用的策略开发方法为离线强化学习得到的策略提供了可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal
policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability
and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains.
Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL
policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to
large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when
using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from
the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an
interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which
is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural
grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures
interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered
controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable
off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development
standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical
judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid
arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this
framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives
to those obtained via offline RL.

Motivation: 解决现代机器学习模型同时实现鲁棒性和资源效率的挑战。

Result: 大学习率能产生理想表征特性，在满足多种属性上优于其他超参数和正则化方法，且标准分类任务中其成功可能源于处理训练数据集中隐藏/罕见的虚假关联。

Conclusion: 大学习率是同时实现模型鲁棒性和网络可压缩性的有效手段。

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Method: 提出基于集成的防御架构。

Result: 相比基线，在FGSM攻击下，集成方法使平均奖励从5.87提升到18.38（超213%增长），平均碰撞率从0.50降至0.09（82%降低），优于所有独立防御策略。

Conclusion: 所提架构能显著增强DRL模型在自动驾驶场景中对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated
its applicability across various domains, including robotics, healthcare,
energy optimization, and autonomous driving. However, a critical question
remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While
existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation
enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap
regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios
specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based
defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances
the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our
ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213%
increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82%
decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all
standalone defense strategies.

Motivation: 解决以往研究缺乏统计实验验证和可能过度补偿传感器漂移的问题，提高传感器漂移补偿的统计严谨性。

Method: 基于同一电子鼻数据集设计两个域适应任务，在UCI数据集上对30个随机测试集分区系统测试三种方法：提出的知识蒸馏（KD）方法、基准方法域正则化成分分析（DRCA）和混合方法KD - DRCA。

Result: KD始终优于DRCA和KD - DRCA，准确率最高提高18%，F1分数最高提高15%。

Conclusion: KD是首次用于电子鼻漂移缓解，显著优于之前的DRCA方法，增强了现实环境中传感器漂移补偿的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the
performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world
deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset
reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical
experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing
class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift
compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation
tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to
predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and
predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous
training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three
methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark
method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method
KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed
that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18%
improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior
effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for
electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift
compensation in real-world environments.

Motivation: 分支限界法（BaB）在探索子问题空间时采用先到先服务方式，效率低下，需要改进以高效得出验证结论。

Method: 引入不同子问题的排序，提出验证框架Oliva，优先探索更可能找到反例的子问题，有贪婪策略$Oliva^{GR}$和受模拟退火启发的平衡策略$Oliva^{SA}$两种变体。

Result: 在690个验证问题、5个模型及MNIST和CIFAR10数据集上实验，Oliva在MNIST上加速达25倍，在CIFAR10上加速达80倍。

Conclusion: Oliva能有效提高神经网络验证效率，且即使找不到反例也不会导致性能下降。

Abstract: The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has
necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the
quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is
a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to
sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the
sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these
sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from
an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this
gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,
concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.
Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that
explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more
likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of
the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it
only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead
to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including
$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that
are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy
inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to
exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally
evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5
models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up
to 80X in CIFAR10.

Method: 提出Zeroth - Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations (ZORMS - LfD)方法。

Result: 在各种基准问题上，ZORMS - LfD在学习损失和计算时间上匹配或超越现有方法；连续时间无约束问题计算时间减少超80%；连续时间有约束问题上优于Nelder - Mead方法。

Conclusion: ZORMS - LfD是一种有效的从专家演示中学习约束最优控制问题的方法，在性能和计算时间上有优势。

Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations
(ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of
constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to
be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the
learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order
methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs,
constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls
and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time,
with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention.
We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across
a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark
problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art
first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On
constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized
state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used
gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.

Abstract: Human decision-making in high-stakes domains often relies on expertise and
heuristics, but is vulnerable to hard-to-detect cognitive biases that threaten
fairness and long-term outcomes. This work presents a novel approach to
enhancing complex decision-making workflows through the integration of
hierarchical learning alongside various enhancements. Focusing on university
admissions as a representative high-stakes domain, we propose BGM-HAN, an
enhanced Byte-Pair Encoded, Gated Multi-head Hierarchical Attention Network,
designed to effectively model semi-structured applicant data. BGM-HAN captures
multi-level representations that are crucial for nuanced assessment, improving
both interpretability and predictive performance. Experimental results on real
admissions data demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms
both state-of-the-art baselines from traditional machine learning to large
language models, offering a promising framework for augmenting decision-making
in domains where structure, context, and fairness matter. Source code is

Conclusion: 强化学习是通过聚焦于小部分持续更新的子网络来适配模型，该发现有助于开发更高效的RL方法，从彩票假设视角重新审视稀疏性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large
language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is
often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's
parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL
fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of
weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced
parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity
constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,
Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show
substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far
exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the
pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers
full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully
fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL
operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted
changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited
effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts
models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,
consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods
and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine learning that uses
probability distributions to describe the world, make predictions, and support
decision-making under uncertainty. Underlying this modeling framework is an
elegant body of theory that bridges two mathematical traditions: probability
and graph theory. This framework provides compact yet expressive
representations of joint probability distributions, yielding powerful
generative models for probabilistic reasoning.
  This tutorial provides a concise introduction to the formalisms, methods, and
applications of this modeling framework. After a review of basic probability
and graph theory, we explore three dominant themes: (1) the representation of
multivariate distributions in the intuitive visual language of graphs, (2)
algorithms for learning model parameters and graphical structures from data,
and (3) algorithms for inference, both exact and approximate.

Abstract: The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, is crucial for
effective containment and treatment, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. This study presents an AI-driven diagnostic tool developed for
deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, leveraging the pre-trained
MobileNetV2 architecture for binary classification. The model was trained on
the open-source Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset, achieving a 93.07% F1-Score,
which reflects a well-balanced performance in precision and recall. To optimize
the model, the TensorRT framework was used to accelerate inference for FP32 and
to perform post-training quantization for FP16 and INT8 formats. TensorRT's
mixed-precision capabilities enabled these optimizations, which reduced the
model size, increased inference speed, and lowered power consumption by
approximately a factor of two, all while maintaining the original accuracy.
Power consumption analysis confirmed that the optimized models used
significantly less energy during inference, reinforcing their suitability for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. The system was deployed with a
Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) hotspot and a web-based interface, enabling users to
upload and analyze images directly through connected devices such as mobile
phones. This setup ensures simple access and seamless connectivity, making the
tool practical for real-world applications. These advancements position the
diagnostic tool as an efficient, scalable, and energy-conscious solution to
address diagnosis challenges in underserved regions, paving the way for broader
adoption in low-resource healthcare settings.

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and preventable types of cancer, yet
its early detection remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited
settings where access to specialized healthcare is scarce. This study proposes
an AI-driven diagnostic tool optimized for embedded systems to address this
gap. Using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture, the model was
adapted for binary classification of skin lesions into "Skin Cancer" and
"Other." The TensorRT framework was employed to compress and optimize the model
for deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, balancing performance with
energy efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted across multiple
benchmarks, including model size, inference speed, throughput, and power
consumption. The optimized models maintained their performance, achieving an
F1-Score of 87.18% with a precision of 93.18% and recall of 81.91%.
Post-compression results showed reductions in model size of up to 0.41, along
with improvements in inference speed and throughput, and a decrease in energy
consumption of up to 0.93 in INT8 precision. These findings validate the
feasibility of deploying high-performing, energy-efficient diagnostic tools on
resource-constrained edge devices. Beyond skin cancer detection, the
methodologies applied in this research have broader applications in other
medical diagnostics and domains requiring accessible, efficient AI solutions.
This study underscores the potential of optimized AI systems to revolutionize
healthcare diagnostics, thereby bridging the divide between advanced technology

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules
and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance
and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and
standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to
new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose
the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework
designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test
time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue,
proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or
corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal,
timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and
resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and
clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence
name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic
knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability
and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and
existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over
150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness
for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

Conclusion: PICore可有效解决神经算子训练的两个瓶颈问题，提高训练效率。

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings
between function spaces. However, there are two main bottlenecks in training
neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We
provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/PICore.

Abstract: Modern network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) frequently utilize the
predictive power of complex deep learning models. However, the "black-box"
nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders
the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and
prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI)
methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the
causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide
explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable
countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based
counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations
for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against
several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3
modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also
presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation
algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our
proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the
tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by
reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how
counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing
them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at
instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global
counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack
queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense
mechanisms.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to global climate
change urges accurate weather prediction. Recently, great advances have been
made by the \textbf{end-to-end methods}, thanks to deep learning techniques,
but they face limitations of \textit{representation inconsistency} in
multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency
between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating
different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \textbf{two-stage
training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue,
but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the
results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an
implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders
for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen
while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second
stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures
inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a
self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the
performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments
show the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces
the MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by
28.82\% and 23.39\%, respectively. The source code is available at

Method: 先使用少量判别训练数据将生成式MLLM转换为多模态分类器，再提出将MLLMs与轻量级路由模型集成的路由-排序级联系统。

Result: 离线实验中F1分数比传统分类器提高66.50%，仅需2%微调数据；在线评估中自动内容审核量增加41%，级联部署将计算成本降至直接全规模部署的1.5%。

Conclusion: 所提基于MLLM的方法在视频内容审核中有效，能提升性能并降低成本，利于工业部署。

Abstract: Effective content moderation is essential for video platforms to safeguard
user experience and uphold community standards. While traditional video
classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they
struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and
contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a
promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal
reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder
their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes
full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for
discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,
we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a
multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable
industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that
integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments
demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over
traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online
evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume
by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5%
of direct full-scale deployment.

Method: 将合成样本参数化为可优化潜在代码，用极轻量级网络解码，以量化潜在代码的香农熵为率度量，现有蒸馏损失为效用度量，通过拉格朗日乘数权衡，引入比特每类（bpc）存储度量。

Conclusion: 所提联合率 - 效用优化方法在数据集蒸馏上表现良好，能有效平衡性能和存储。

Abstract: Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

Motivation: Transformer核心自注意力机制时间复杂度高，现有优化方法存在丢弃全上下文信息或缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 在嵌入维度上分组数据，采用轻量级采样和融合方法，利用局部敏感哈希分组相似数据，设计块级分组框架限制误差，优化块大小选择并集成FlashAttention - 2。

Result: 计算自注意力比FlashAttention - 2快37%；ViT推理中速度最快且最准确；Llama3 - 1B中推理时间最短，准确率仅损失1%。

Conclusion: DistrAttention是一种高效、灵活且能保留全上下文信息的自注意力机制，在多种模型推理中表现出色。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the
state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing,
computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component,
self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence
length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches
on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack
of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and
flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention
achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually
referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and
fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A
block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors
introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block
sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining
high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive
experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than
FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,
DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate
self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the
lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.

Method: 提出类似VAE的训练方法，引入聚类中心，不依赖传统KL散度和重参数化技术；将方法扩展到多个可学习向量。

Result: 在MNIST、CelebA和FashionMNIST数据集上插值过渡平滑但有模糊；扩展到多向量时，模型在连续空间接近VQ - VAE，输出多向量时退化为VQ - AE，无法学习语义表示。

Conclusion: 强调编码空间紧凑性和分散性在生成建模中的关键作用，为VAE和VQ - VAE的设计和局限性提供新视角。

Abstract: This paper explores the generative capabilities of Autoencoders (AEs) and
establishes connections between Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Vector
Quantized-Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) through a reformulated training
framework. We demonstrate that AEs exhibit generative potential via latent
space interpolation and perturbation, albeit limited by undefined regions in
the encoding space. To address this, we propose a new VAE-like training method
that introduces clustering centers to enhance data compactness and ensure
well-defined latent spaces without relying on traditional KL divergence or
reparameterization techniques. Experimental results on MNIST, CelebA, and
FashionMNIST datasets show smooth interpolative transitions, though blurriness
persists. Extending this approach to multiple learnable vectors, we observe a
natural progression toward a VQ-VAE-like model in continuous space. However,
when the encoder outputs multiple vectors, the model degenerates into a
discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which combines image fragments without learning
semantic representations. Our findings highlight the critical role of encoding
space compactness and dispersion in generative modeling and provide insights
into the intrinsic connections between VAEs and VQ-VAEs, offering a new
perspective on their design and limitations.

Abstract: Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations
(DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a
critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or
specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event
Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES
data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation
events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating
interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries
for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.
This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational
issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck
identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities,
outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves
near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex
investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to
uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling
and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights,
reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency
evaluation and diagnosis.

Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of increasing relevance in real world
applications, aimed at building a global model across a network of
heterogeneous users without requiring the sharing of private data. We focus on
model learning over decentralized architectures, where users collaborate
directly to update the global model without relying on a central server. In
this context, the current paper proposes a novel approach to collaboratively
learn probabilistic generative classifiers with a parametric form. The
framework is composed by a communication network over a set of local nodes,
each of one having its own local data, and a local updating rule. The proposal
involves sharing local statistics with neighboring nodes, where each node
aggregates the neighbors' information and iteratively learns its own local
classifier, which progressively converges to a global model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm consistently converges to a globally
competitive model across a wide range of network topologies, network sizes,
local dataset sizes, and extreme non-i.i.d. data distributions.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，R - Stitch可将推理延迟降低达85%，且准确率下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: R - Stitch在加速思维链推理方面具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

Result: 实验验证了识别有效工具变量和学习策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的C2L模型和两阶段框架能有效解决模仿学习中的混淆效应问题。

Abstract: Imitation learning from demonstrations usually suffers from the confounding
effects of unmeasured variables (i.e., unmeasured confounders) on the states
and actions. If ignoring them, a biased estimation of the policy would be
entailed. To break up this confounding gap, in this paper, we take the best of
the strong power of instrumental variables (IV) and propose a Confounded Causal
Imitation Learning (C2L) model. This model accommodates confounders that
influence actions across multiple timesteps, rather than being restricted to
immediate temporal dependencies. We develop a two-stage imitation learning
framework for valid IV identification and policy optimization. In particular,
in the first stage, we construct a testing criterion based on the defined
pseudo-variable, with which we achieve identifying a valid IV for the C2L
models. Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability
conditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we
propose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator,
while the other is offline. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of
identifying the valid IV as well as learning the policy.

Abstract: Recent developments in mechanical, aerospace, and structural engineering have
driven a growing need for efficient ways to model and analyse structures at
much larger and more complex scales than before. While established numerical
methods like the Finite Element Method remain reliable, they often struggle
with computational cost and scalability when dealing with large and
geometrically intricate problems. In recent years, neural network-based methods
have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate
nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely
limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs
involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain
decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a
single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a
surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle
large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical
result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of
domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method
by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous
microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural
operator (PPNO). Our results show that this approach not only outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on these challenging problems, but also offers
resolution-invariance and strong generalization to microstructural patterns
unseen during training.

Conclusion: 本文填补了分布式机器学习在高延迟低带宽网络环境下的理论空白，DeCo - SGD能根据实时网络条件和训练任务动态调整参数，提升训练速度。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning in high end-to-end latency and low, varying
bandwidth network environments undergoes severe throughput degradation. Due to
its low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the
mainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from
significant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing
approaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to
alleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both
challenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a
complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed
synchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance
under varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to
dynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on
static heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which
prevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical
gap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization
problem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable
noise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies
the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a
critical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect
training. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware
time minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the
compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and
training task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and
static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,
respectively.

Abstract: An ordinal classification (OC) problem corresponds to a special type of
classification characterised by the presence of a natural order relationship
among the classes. This type of problem can be found in a number of real-world
applications, motivating the design and development of many ordinal
methodologies over the last years. However, it is important to highlight that
the development of the OC field suffers from one main disadvantage: the lack of
a comprehensive set of datasets on which novel approaches to the literature
have to be benchmarked. In order to approach this objective, this manuscript
from the University of C\'ordoba (UCO), which have previous experience on the
OC field, provides the literature with a publicly available repository of
tabular data for a robust validation of novel OC approaches, namely TOC-UCO
(Tabular Ordinal Classification repository of the UCO). Specifically, this
repository includes a set of $46$ tabular ordinal datasets, preprocessed under
a common framework and ensured to have a reasonable number of patterns and an

TL;DR: 提出DynaSearcher应对多步代理检索系统挑战，实验显示其在多跳问答数据集上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多步代理检索系统在实际应用中存在生成事实不一致的中间查询和低效搜索轨迹的问题。

Method: 提出DynaSearcher，利用动态知识图引导搜索过程，采用多奖励强化学习框架控制训练目标。

Result: 在六个多跳问答数据集上达到了最先进的答案准确率，在不同检索环境和更大规模模型中表现出强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DynaSearcher方法具有广泛适用性，可在有限资源下取得良好效果。

Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks.
However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical
applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate
queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning
deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose
DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs
and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system
leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search
process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual
consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for
fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy,
efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of
high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while
discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or
redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets,
matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited
computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and
larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法难以平衡稳定性和可塑性，在极端样本稀缺时易崩溃，无法有效处理长尾数据分布。

Method: 提出ViRN框架，通过变分自编码器建模类条件分布，用基于Wasserstein距离的邻域检索和几何融合重建尾类分布。

Result: 在六个长尾分类基准测试（包括语音和图像任务）上，ViRN比现有方法平均准确率提高10.24%。

Conclusion: ViRN框架能有效解决长尾数据的持续学习问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with long-tailed data distributions remains a
critical challenge for real-world AI systems, where models must sequentially
adapt to new classes while retaining knowledge of old ones, despite severe
class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to balance stability and plasticity,
often collapsing under extreme sample scarcity. To address this, we propose
ViRN, a novel CL framework that integrates variational inference (VI) with
distributional trilateration for robust long-tailed learning. First, we model
class-conditional distributions via a Variational Autoencoder to mitigate bias
toward head classes. Second, we reconstruct tail-class distributions via
Wasserstein distance-based neighborhood retrieval and geometric fusion,
enabling sample-efficient alignment of tail-class representations. Evaluated on
six long-tailed classification benchmarks, including speech (e.g., rare
acoustic events, accents) and image tasks, ViRN achieves a 10.24% average
accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有C - GCD方法在处理无标签数据流时存在灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是当无标签数据混合已知和新类别时。

Method: 从贝叶斯视角分析C - GCD的遗忘动态，提出VB - CGCD框架，将变分推理与协方差感知最近类均值分类相结合，通过随机变分更新自适应对齐类分布并抑制伪标签噪声。

Conclusion: VB - CGCD能有效解决C - GCD的灾难性遗忘问题，在不同场景下具有强大的适用性。

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge:
incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving
knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We
address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens,
revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives
performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes
C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with
covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns
class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic
variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21%
with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also
introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended
online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher
than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across
diverse scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/daihao42/VB-CGCD

Motivation: 现有量化方法实验缺乏统一标准，且需分析理论联系。

Method: 广泛综述现有方法，在统一基础上全面评估，将量化方法解耦为预量化变换和量化误差缓解两步。

Result: 预量化变换中优化旋转和缩放性能最佳；量化误差缓解中低秩补偿结合GPTQ有时优于单用GPTQ；INT4的最优预量化策略不适用于MXFP4。

Conclusion: 本次研究对量化方法进行了公平且广泛的调查，研究结果为后续研究提供了方向。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can
significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model
quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have
reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same
ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In
addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is
crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an
extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive
evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge,
this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet
underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple
the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization
transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a
preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of
outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for
quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the
errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We
evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization
methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and
its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation
and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and
combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ
alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential
of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization
transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring
further investigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出C3RL框架解决多元时间序列预测问题，结合通道混合和通道独立策略，经实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多元时间序列预测方法中，通道混合策略无法识别特定变量时间模式，通道独立策略不能充分利用交叉变量依赖，混合策略泛化性和可解释性有限。

Method: 提出C3RL框架，将两种策略输入视为转置视图构建孪生网络架构，通过自适应加权联合优化对比和预测损失。

Result: 在七个模型上的实验表明，C3RL使基于通道独立策略模型的最佳性能率提升到81.4%，基于通道混合策略模型提升到76.3%。

Conclusion: C3RL具有较强的泛化性和有效性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to
its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either
channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can
capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific
temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit
cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion
offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we
propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models
both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer
vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and
builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone,
while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and
prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and
forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL
boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy
and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong
generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is
accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer训练需自适应学习率优化器，因梯度重尾分布难以用mSGDW训练，本文旨在克服此局限。

Method: 在Transformer适当位置集成归一化技术，调节每层雅可比矩阵，平衡权重、激活及其交互影响，使梯度分布集中。

Result: DNT在两个流行Transformer架构上表现优于对应模型，且能用mSGDW有效训练。

Conclusion: DNT能解决现有Transformer训练依赖高级优化器的问题，可用mSGDW训练并取得良好性能。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.

Motivation: 现有生成模型假设平凡几何并依赖强密度估计假设，轨迹不遵循底层流形最优原则。

Method: 基于Hamilton - Jacobi - Bellman，通过Kantorovich势显式解决对偶动态OT问题。

Result: HOTA在标准基准和非可微成本自定义数据集上，在可行性和最优性方面均优于所有基线。

Conclusion: HOTA是一种有效且可扩展的轨迹优化方法，能避免显式密度建模，在多种情况下表现良好。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the
probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial
geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions,
yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in
the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection
(HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical
OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and
scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for
explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are
non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks,
as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of
feasibility and optimality.

Result: 理论分析表明在累积遗憾界上优于流行替代方法，实验进一步证明其优点。

Conclusion: 新算法框架能有效整合低秩结构和图信息，提升决策效果。

Abstract: The matrix contextual bandit (CB), as an extension of the well-known
multi-armed bandit, is a powerful framework that has been widely applied in
sequential decision-making scenarios involving low-rank structure. In many
real-world scenarios, such as online advertising and recommender systems,
additional graph information often exists beyond the low-rank structure, that
is, the similar relationships among users/items can be naturally captured
through the connectivity among nodes in the corresponding graphs. However,
existing matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby
making them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill
in this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework
that builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new
framework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph
information in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a
joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the
implementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB
algorithm. Rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that our procedure
outperforms several popular alternatives in terms of cumulative regret bound,
owing to the effective utilization of graph information. A series of synthetic
and real-world data experiments are conducted to further illustrate the merits
of our procedure.

Motivation: GAE无法处理分布强化学习中的值分布，本文旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: 利用最优传输理论引入类Wasserstein方向度量，结合指数加权估计推导DGAE，并将其集成到三种策略梯度方法中。

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中评估算法，并与传统GAE基线进行比较。

Conclusion: DGAE能像传统GAE一样提供低方差、可控偏差的优势估计，适合依赖优势估计进行策略更新的策略梯度算法。

Abstract: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) has been used to mitigate the
computational complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) by employing an
exponentially weighted estimation of the advantage function to reduce the
variance in policy gradient estimates. Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not
designed to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can
capture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to
system noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes
the optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional
metric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies
between probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation,
we leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional
GAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a
low-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for
policy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy
updates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods.
Algorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared
with the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance.

Abstract: Ensemble Machine Learning (EML) techniques, especially stacking, have been
shown to improve predictive performance by combining multiple base models.
However, they are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. In this
paper, we introduce XStacking, an effective and inherently explainable
framework that addresses this limitation by integrating dynamic feature
transformation with model-agnostic Shapley additive explanations. This enables
stacked models to retain their predictive accuracy while becoming inherently
explainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on 29 datasets,
achieving improvements in both the predictive effectiveness of the learning
space and the interpretability of the resulting models. XStacking offers a
practical and scalable solution for responsible ML.

Abstract: The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on
manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the
performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise
for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from
supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.
However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different
meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box
functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical
comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned
algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to
meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the
interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.
Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL
algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as
performant as possible.

Result: 在五个基准测试上，OGCIL比现有GCIL和开放集GNN方法更有效。

Conclusion: OGCIL框架能有效解决开放集图类增量学习中的问题，实现鲁棒的开放集识别。

Abstract: Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs)
to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class
knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods
primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed
to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge
during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a
more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two
intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs
the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which
destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,
a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding
generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust
detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional
variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old
classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle
unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node
embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further
proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class
prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all
unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly
models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a
robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN
methods.

Motivation: 现有对称损失函数存在欠拟合问题，非对称损失函数虽有优势但与先进优化框架不兼容，为填补理论空白和发挥非对称损失潜力。

Method: 将非对称损失扩展到更复杂的被动损失场景，提出AMSE，建立其满足非对称条件的充要条件，用AMSE替代APL中的传统对称被动损失得到JAL。

Result: 广泛实验证明所提方法在缓解标签噪声方面有效。

Conclusion: 提出的AMSE和JAL框架能有效应对学习含噪声标签问题。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

Motivation: 现有方法存储各任务适配器增加内存需求，模型合并技术会导致性能大幅下降，需解决存储与性能平衡问题。

Method: 引入HydraOpt，利用低秩适配器矩阵的内在相似性。

Result: 相比存储所有适配器，HydraOpt显著减少48%存储大小，性能仅下降0.2 - 1.8%，在存储效率相同或稍差时性能优于现有合并技术。

Conclusion: HydraOpt能在存储大小和性能之间实现更好平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based
adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a
separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements,
posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile
devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they
typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we
introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the
inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike
existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and
performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and
performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage
size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving
competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing
merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse
storage efficiency.

matching has emerged as a powerful and efficient alternative to diffusion-based
generative modeling, with growing interest in its application to problems in
biology and life sciences. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of recent developments in flow matching and its applications in biological
domains. We begin by systematically reviewing the foundations and variants of
flow matching, and then categorize its applications into three major areas:
biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and
protein generation. For each, we provide an in-depth review of recent progress.
We also summarize commonly used datasets and software tools, and conclude with
a discussion of potential future directions. The corresponding curated

*Anisha Gunjal,Anthony Wang,Elaine Lau,Vaskar Nath,Bing Liu,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Rubrics as Rewards (RaR)框架用于策略训练，在HealthBench - 1k上有提升，能让小模型更好符合人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将RLVR扩展到现实任务需平衡评估标准，很多任务缺乏明确真相，传统基于偏好方法的奖励函数不透明、难解释且易有虚假关联。

Method: 引入RaR框架，使用结构化清单式规则作为可解释奖励信号进行GRPO策略训练。

Result: 最佳RaR方法在HealthBench - 1k上比简单Likert方法相对提升28%，性能匹配或超过专家参考奖励信号。

Conclusion: 将规则作为结构化奖励信号，RaR能让小尺度判断模型更好符合人类偏好，在不同模型尺度上保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world
tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria.
However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it
difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models.
While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on
opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious
correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework
that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals
for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$
relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based
approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals
derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured
reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better
align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model
scales.

TL;DR: 本文提出分数阶SPIKE微分方程神经网络（fspikeDE），用分数阶动力学捕捉膜电压和尖峰序列的长期依赖，实验表明其性能优于传统SNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNNs假设神经元膜电压动态为单一时间常数，具有马尔可夫特性，限制了网络表达能力，而真实神经元有非马尔可夫行为。

Method: 提出fspikeDE，通过分数阶动力学捕捉长期依赖；引入梯度下降算法，用伴随灵敏度方法逆向求解增广分数阶ODE来优化参数。

Result: 在不同图像和图数据集上实验，fspikeDE精度更高、能效相当、训练内存使用减少、抗噪性增强。

Conclusion: 该方法为分数阶SNNs提供了新颖的开源计算工具箱，可广泛应用于现实任务。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to
create realistic models for brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness
in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological
realism. Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane
voltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
with Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time
depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network
expressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by
long-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting
non-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE
Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term
dependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order
dynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns
beyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of
fspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters
by solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using
adjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph
datasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs,
achieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training
memory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a
novel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely
applicable to various real-world tasks.

TL;DR: 本文为VLA模型提出评估指标，经大规模实证研究表明部分指标与人工评估有相关性，挑战了仅依赖任务成功率的评估方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型通常通过任务成功率评估，无法体现任务执行质量和模型决策信心，需要新的评估指标。

Method: 提出八个不确定性指标和五个质量指标，对三个先进VLA模型在四个典型机器人操作任务中的908次成功执行进行大规模实证研究，结合人类专家手动标注分析指标与专家判断的相关性。

Result: 部分指标与人类评估有中到强的相关性，一些指标能区分不同质量的执行和不成功任务。

Conclusion: 当前仅依赖二元成功率的评估方式不够充分，新指标为VLA机器人系统的实时监控和自适应增强开辟了道路。

Abstract: Visual Language Action (VLA) models are a multi-modal class of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems that integrate visual perception, natural language
understanding, and action planning to enable agents to interpret their
environment, comprehend instructions, and perform embodied tasks autonomously.
Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds
of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to
capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its
decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality
metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We
assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908
successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four
representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually
labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our
proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics
show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their
utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found
that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and
low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when
test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current
evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way
for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled
robotic systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨可达性估计器的可靠性，提出评估框架并在真实程序上评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试中最大可实现覆盖率估计很关键，现有静态可达性分析不准确，统计估计方法因缺乏可靠基准难以严格评估准确性，需考察可达性估计器可靠性。

Method: 一是提出评估框架，合成有复杂控制流的大程序以提供评估的真实标记；二是在无标记真实基准上，通过改变采样单元大小对可达性估计器进行可靠性检查。

Result: 两项研究有助于回答当前可达性估计器是否可靠的问题，并定义评估未来可达性估计改进的协议。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但研究旨在评估可达性估计器可靠性并为未来改进提供评估协议。

Abstract: Background: Fuzzers are often guided by coverage, making the estimation of
maximum achievable coverage a key concern in fuzzing. However, achieving 100%
coverage is infeasible for most real-world software systems, regardless of
effort. While static reachability analysis can provide an upper bound, it is
often highly inaccurate. Recently, statistical estimation methods based on
species richness estimators from biostatistics have been proposed as a
potential solution. Yet, the lack of reliable benchmarks with labeled ground
truth has limited rigorous evaluation of their accuracy.
  Objective: This work examines the reliability of reachability estimators from
two axes: addressing the lack of labeled ground truth and evaluating their
reliability on real-world programs.
  Methods: (1) To address the challenge of labeled ground truth, we propose an
evaluation framework that synthetically generates large programs with complex
control flows, ensuring well-defined reachability and providing ground truth
for evaluation. (2) To address the criticism from use of synthetic benchmarks,
we adapt a reliability check for reachability estimators on real-world
benchmarks without labeled ground truth -- by varying the size of sampling
units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate.
  Results: These two studies together will help answer the question of whether
current reachability estimators are reliable, and defines a protocol to
evaluate future improvements in reachability estimation.

TL;DR: 评估六种大语言模型生成GitHub Actions配置能力，发现模型有局限，研究为改进提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续集成服务配置编写繁琐易错，大语言模型生成CI配置能力未充分探索。

Method: 评估三种通用基础模型和三种代码预训练模型，构建首个相关标注数据集。

Result: 零样本提示相似度达69%，完美匹配仅3%，代码预训练模型稍逊，GPT-4o输出有问题。

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成CI配置有局限，研究为改进模型与配置语言对齐及CI自动化提供指导。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions, require
developers to write YAML-based configurations, which can be tedious and
error-prone. Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
automate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI
configurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study
evaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural
language descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models
(GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code
Llama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind,
constructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with
corresponding best-practice YAML configurations. Zero-shot prompting achieves
up to 69% similarity with the ground truth, with only 3% perfect matches.
Code-pretrained models slightly underperform compared to general-purpose ones
in YAML-based CI tasks, revealing LLM limitations for CI configuration
generation. Analyzing GPT-4o outputs reveals issues like missing or renamed
steps, misinterpreted descriptions, and unnecessary additions that may affect
structural and contextual correctness, indicating a gap between generation
quality and the precision required for executable CI configurations. Our
research offers insights for improving LLM alignment with configuration
languages and guiding future efforts on CI automation and tooling support.

Conclusion: 本研究有助于开发更强大、可扩展的量子软件测试策略，推动容错量子计算机的应用和量子软件工程的可靠实践。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of quantum software presents significant challenges
for software verification and validation, particularly in the context of unit
testing. This work presents a comprehensive study on quantum-centric unit
tests, comparing traditional statistical approaches with tests specifically
designed for quantum circuits. These include tests that run only on a classical
computer, such as the Statevector test, as well as those executable on quantum
hardware, such as the Swap test and the novel Inverse test. Through an
empirical study and detailed analysis on 1,796,880 mutated quantum circuits, we
investigate (a) each test's ability to detect subtle discrepancies between the
expected and actual states of a quantum circuit, and (b) the number of
measurements required to achieve high reliability. The results demonstrate that
quantum-centric tests, particularly the Statevector test and the Inverse test,
provide clear advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, reducing both
false positives and false negatives compared to statistical tests. This work
contributes to the development of more robust and scalable strategies for
testing quantum software, supporting the future adoption of fault-tolerant
quantum computers and promoting more reliable practices in quantum software
engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解提示编程中开发者更新提示的问题以及现有工具是否满足需求。

Method: 对16位提示程序员进行访谈、观察8位开发者进行提示更改、对50位开发者进行调查，并将分类法与48个研究和商业工具进行对比。

Result: 提示编程支持不佳，所有任务手动完成，51个问题中有16个未得到解答。

Conclusion: 提示编程工具存在重要改进机会。

Abstract: Prompting foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have
enabled new AI-powered software features (e.g., text summarization) that
previously were only possible by fine-tuning FMs. Now, developers are embedding
prompts in software, known as prompt programs. The process of prompt
programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet,
the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the
answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With
the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is
unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We
address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt
programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task
and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make
prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48
research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not
well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions --
including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on
this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析项目失败原因，为分布式项目管理提供经验。

Method: 对项目进行根本原因分析，找出技术、组织和心理方面障碍。

Result: 大爆炸式集成使系统功能远低于预期，仅实现6分钟功能。

Conclusion: 建议早期基于模型部署、建立强大通信基础设施、采用自上而下思维，强调传统敏捷方法局限性，提出模拟驱动工程和结构化集成周期。

Abstract: This experience report analyses a one year project focused on building a
distributed real-time analytics system using edge computing and machine
learning. The project faced critical setbacks due to a big-bang integration
approach, where all components developed by multiple geographically dispersed
partners were merged at the final stage. The integration effort resulted in
only six minutes of system functionality, far below the expected 40 minutes.
Through root cause analysis, the study identifies technical and organisational
barriers, including poor communication, lack of early integration testing, and
resistance to topdown planning. It also considers psychological factors such as
a bias toward fully developed components over mockups. The paper advocates for
early mock based deployment, robust communication infrastructures, and the
adoption of topdown thinking to manage complexity and reduce risk in reactive,
distributed projects. These findings underscore the limitations of traditional
Agile methods in such contexts and propose simulation-driven engineering and
structured integration cycles as key enablers for future success.

Method: 提出Seed&Steer两步法，结合传统单元测试技术与大语言模型能力，利用传统工具生成高编译成功率的方法调用作为种子，引入分支线索引导大语言模型生成高覆盖率断言。

Result: 在五个真实Java项目上评估，相比基线方法，编译通过率提高约7%，在两个大语言模型上成功编译之前失败的案例，分支和行覆盖率最高达约73%，覆盖率提升1.09 - 1.26倍。

Conclusion: Seed&Steer方法能有效提升单元测试生成的编译通过率和测试覆盖率，代码、数据集和实验脚本将公开以支持后续研究和复现。

Abstract: Unit tests play a vital role in the software development lifecycle. Recent
advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly
improved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and
industry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by
decoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their
respective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic
Complexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation,
revealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the
latter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose
Seed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing
techniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages
conventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations
with high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in
constructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help
LLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception
cases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on
five real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show
that Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%,
successfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. It
also achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of
varying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*. Our
code, dataset, and experimental scripts will be publicly released to support
future research and reproducibility.

technology in an infrastructure to serve ML workflows. In this paper, we
present the design and implementation of a data virtualization service,
focusing on its service architecture and service operations. The infrastructure
currently supports six ML applications, each with more than one ML workflow.
The data virtualization service allows the number of applications and workflows

Motivation: 代码异味在专业代码研究多，但在新手基于Scratch项目中的意义未知，需探索CT能力与设计层面代码异味的联系及任务情境的影响。

Method: 随机抽取约200万个公共Scratch项目，用开源代码检查工具提取CT分数和代码异味指标，经预处理后进行描述性分析、相关性测试、分层交叉验证和机器学习建模，辅以定性抽查。

Abstract: Context. Code smells, which are recurring anomalies in design or style, have
been extensively researched in professional code. However, their significance
in block-based projects created by novices is still largely unknown.
Block-based environments such as Scratch offer a unique, data-rich setting to
examine how emergent design problems intersect with the cultivation of
computational-thinking (CT) skills. Objective. This research explores the
connection between CT proficiency and design-level code smells--issues that may
hinder software maintenance and evolution--in programs created by Scratch
developers. We seek to identify which CT dimensions align most strongly with
which code smells and whether task context moderates those associations.
Method. A random sample of aprox. 2 million public Scratch projects is mined.
Using open-source linters, we extract nine CT scores and 40 code smell
indicators from these projects. After rigorous pre-processing, we apply
descriptive analytics, robust correlation tests, stratified cross-validation,
and exploratory machine-learning models; qualitative spot-checks contextualize
quantitative patterns. Impact. The study will deliver the first large-scale,
fine-grained map linking specific CT competencies to concrete design flaws and
antipatterns. Results are poised to (i) inform evidence-based curricula and
automated feedback systems, (ii) provide effect-size benchmarks for future
educational interventions, and (iii) supply an open, pseudonymized dataset and
reproducible analysis pipeline for the research community. By clarifying how
programming habits influence early skill acquisition, the work advances both
computing-education theory and practical tooling for sustainable software
maintenance and evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测工具依赖二进制JARs，限制了API演化大规模纵向研究和细粒度分析，需新工具。

Method: 引入Roseau工具构建技术无关的API模型，以JApiCmp和Revapi为基线评估其准确性、性能和适用性。

Result: Roseau的F1值达0.99，高于JApiCmp和Revapi；分析60个流行库性能出色；追踪Guava API将分析时间从几天降至几分钟。

Conclusion: Roseau适用于API演化的纵向研究，比传统工具更准确高效，有新分析能力。

Abstract: Understanding API evolution and the introduction of breaking changes (BCs) in
software libraries is essential for library maintainers to manage backward
compatibility and for researchers to conduct empirical studies on software
library evolution. In Java, tools such as JApiCmp and Revapi are commonly used
to detect BCs between library releases, but their reliance on binary JARs
limits their applicability. This restriction hinders large-scale longitudinal
studies of API evolution and fine-grained analyses such as commit-level BC
detection. In this paper, we introduce Roseau, a novel static analysis tool
that constructs technology-agnostic API models from library code equipped with
rich semantic analyses. API models can be analyzed to study API evolution and
compared to identify BCs between any two versions of a library (releases,
commits, branches, etc.). Unlike traditional approaches, Roseau can build API
models from source code or bytecode, and is optimized for large-scale
longitudinal analyses of library histories. We assess the accuracy,
performance, and suitability of Roseau for longitudinal studies of API
evolution, using JApiCmp and Revapi as baselines. We extend and refine an
established benchmark of BCs and show that Roseau achieves higher accuracy (F1
= 0.99) than JApiCmp (F1 = 0.86) and Revapi (F1 = 0.91). We analyze 60 popular
libraries from Maven Central and find that Roseau delivers excellent
performance, detecting BCs between versions in under two seconds, including in
libraries with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We further illustrate
the limitations of JApiCmp and Revapi for longitudinal studies and the novel
analysis capabilities offered by Roseau by tracking the evolution of Google's
Guava API and the introduction of BCs over 14 years and 6,839 commits, reducing
analysis times from a few days to a few minutes.

Result: 完成对当前TDD技术的系统评估。

Conclusion: 为未来开发更有效鲁棒的检测方法提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them
indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models
occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code
snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data,
and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible
and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become
a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural
language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely
underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured
syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To
address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven
state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance
across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a
function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three
programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded
from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design
targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three
distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the
well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study
provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers
insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection
methods in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源和工业环境中多数Bug报告时缺乏可执行测试，使诊断和解决更困难耗时，需要自动生成Bug可复现测试的技术。

Method: 引入AssertFlip技术，先利用大语言模型为错误行为生成通过测试，再反转这些测试使其在有Bug时失败。

Result: AssertFlip在SWT - Bench排行榜上优于所有已知技术，在SWT - Bench - Verified子集上实现43.6%的失败到通过成功率。

Conclusion: AssertFlip是一种有效的自动生成Bug可复现测试的技术。

Abstract: Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process,
yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable
tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and
resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we
introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug
Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing
methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first
generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to
fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing
passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that
AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a
benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass
success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前代码推理方法在性能提升和泛化性方面存在局限，原因是训练数据质量低和监督微调的局限性。

Method: 提出CodeReasoner框架，包括构建聚焦Python程序核心执行逻辑的数据集，进行指令调优注入知识，在微调模型上进行GRPO强化学习。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的代码推理基准测试中，CodeReasoner用7B模型性能提升27.1% - 40.2%，7B模型在关键任务上与GPT - 4o匹配，14B模型全面超越。

Conclusion: CodeReasoner有效提升代码推理性能，消融实验证实各训练阶段有效，强调推理链的重要性。

Abstract: Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs)
in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's
execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether
a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for
downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior
approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code
reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize
across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low
quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which
struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we
propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a
two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets
that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply
instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a
powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through
GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on
three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves
performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the
7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction.
When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks.
Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight
the importance of reasoning chains.

Motivation: 现有提交消息生成方法仅依赖代码差异，无法获取生成高质量消息所需完整上下文。

Method: 提出基于上下文代码检索的C3Gen方法，从仓库检索相关代码片段作为模型输入。

Result: C3Gen能让模型利用额外信息生成更全面、有价值的提交消息，同时对基于相似度的指标可靠性提出质疑。

Conclusion: C3Gen方法有效，能为提交消息生成提供经验见解。

Abstract: A commit message describes the main code changes in a commit and plays a
crucial role in software maintenance. Existing commit message generation (CMG)
approaches typically frame it as a direct mapping which inputs a code diff and
produces a brief descriptive sentence as output. However, we argue that relying
solely on the code diff is insufficient, as raw code diff fails to capture the
full context needed for generating high-quality and informative commit
messages. In this paper, we propose a contextual code retrieval-based method
called C3Gen to enhance CMG by retrieving commit-relevant code snippets from
the repository and incorporating them into the model input to provide richer
contextual information at the repository scope. In the experiments, we
evaluated the effectiveness of C3Gen across various models using four objective
and three subjective metrics. Meanwhile, we design and conduct a human
evaluation to investigate how C3Gen-generated commit messages are perceived by
human developers. The results show that by incorporating contextual code into
the input, C3Gen enables models to effectively leverage additional information
to generate more comprehensive and informative commit messages with greater
practical value in real-world development scenarios. Further analysis
underscores concerns about the reliability of similaritybased metrics and
provides empirical insights for CMG.

Conclusion: CASCADE方法可靠灵活，能克服现有反混淆技术的局限性。

Abstract: Software obfuscation, particularly prevalent in JavaScript, hinders code
comprehension and analysis, posing significant challenges to software testing,
static analysis, and malware detection. This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel
hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with
the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate
Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to
identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the
most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code
transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original
strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method
overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques,
eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving
reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production
environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation
efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.

Result: 开发了将代码相关问题与面向对象编程特定学习挑战联系起来的概念图。

Conclusion: 开发的概念图经专家评估，具有一定的相关性和在教育场景的适用性。

Abstract: Object-Oriented programming is frequently challenging for undergraduate
Computer Science students, particularly in understanding abstract concepts such
as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Although the literature
outlines various methods to identify potential design and coding issues in
object-oriented programming through source code analysis, such as code smells
and SOLID principles, few studies explore how these code-level issues relate to
learning difficulties in Object-Oriented Programming. In this study, we explore
the relationship of the code issue indicators with common challenges
encountered during the learning of object-oriented programming. Using
qualitative analysis, we identified the main categories of learning
difficulties and, through a literature review, established connections between
these difficulties, code smells, and violations of the SOLID principles. As a
result, we developed a conceptual map that links code-related issues to
specific learning challenges in Object-Oriented Programming. The model was then
evaluated by an expert who applied it in the analysis of the student code to
assess its relevance and applicability in educational contexts.

Result: 形式上推导了二阶渐近近似，蒙特卡罗模拟表明纳入修正能改善投资组合策略的损益。

Conclusion: 多尺度波动率展开方法能有效处理含随机波动率的动态投资组合优化问题，提升策略表现。

Abstract: We consider a dynamic portfolio optimization problem that incorporates
predictable returns, instantaneous transaction costs, price impact, and
stochastic volatility, extending the classical results of Garleanu and Pedersen
(2013), which assume constant volatility. Constructing the optimal portfolio
strategy in this general setting is challenging due to the nonlinear nature of
the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. To address this, we
propose a multi-scale volatility expansion that captures stochastic volatility
dynamics across different time scales. Specifically, the analysis involves a
singular perturbation for the fast mean-reverting volatility factor and a
regular perturbation for the slow-moving factor. We also introduce an
approximation for small price impact and demonstrate its numerical accuracy. We
formally derive asymptotic approximations up to second order and use Monte
Carlo simulations to show how incorporating these corrections improves the
Profit and Loss (PnL) of the resulting portfolio strategy.

Abstract: Sparse portfolio optimization is a fundamental yet challenging problem in
quantitative finance, since traditional approaches heavily relying on
historical return statistics and static objectives can hardly adapt to dynamic
market regimes. To address this issue, we propose Evolutionary Factor Search
(EFS), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
automate the generation and evolution of alpha factors for sparse portfolio
construction. By reformulating the asset selection problem as a top-m ranking
task guided by LLM-generated factors, EFS incorporates an evolutionary feedback
loop to iteratively refine the factor pool based on performance. Extensive
experiments on five Fama-French benchmark datasets and three real-market
datasets (US50, HSI45 and CSI300) demonstrate that EFS significantly
outperforms both statistical-based and optimization-based baselines, especially
in larger asset universes and volatile conditions. Comprehensive ablation
studies validate the importance of prompt composition, factor diversity, and
LLM backend choice. Our results highlight the promise of language-guided
evolution as a robust and interpretable paradigm for portfolio optimization
under structural constraints.

Abstract: Estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices is a key task across many
fields. This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance
estimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is
constrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each
observe different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random
vector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using
a limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight
minimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and
Frobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong
data processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data
Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI
coefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional
SDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent
channel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient
over the state input.
  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality,
we compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to
establish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs
among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on
this, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and
communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.
Unlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite
samples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we
extend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can
significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive
schemes.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效帮助决策者，且开源实现利于推广。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify
preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization
problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's
utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a
principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance
exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions.
The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after
estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization
techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a
reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making
process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our
method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with
a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our
method to support its adoption by the broader community.

Conclusion: 弱分类器对验证神经后验估计有被低估的优势，保形C2ST是基于现代模拟推理的实用且有理论依据的诊断方法。

Abstract: Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) has emerged as a powerful approach for
amortized Bayesian inference when the true posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ is
intractable or difficult to sample. But evaluating the accuracy of neural
posterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from
major limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier
two-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples
from the true posterior $p(\theta \mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation
$q(\theta \mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its
theoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a
near-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,
difficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still
be useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.
Building on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a
conformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores
-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample
p-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:
(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that
degrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot
is that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and
reliable tests. Empirically, the Conformal C2ST outperforms classical
discriminative tests across a wide range of benchmarks. These results reveal
the under appreciated strength of weak classifiers for validating neural
posterior estimates, establishing the conformal C2ST as a practical,
theoretically grounded diagnostic for modern simulation-based inference.

Motivation: 现有评估神经后验估计质量的方法有实际缺陷，需新方法检测真实后验与近似后验的差异。

Result: 理论上建立评估分布相等的充要条件；实证上表现优于现有方法，能定位显著差异区域。

Conclusion: CoLT是验证神经后验估计的先进解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of validating whether a neural posterior estimate \(
q(\theta \mid x) \) is an accurate approximation to the true, unknown true
posterior \( p(\theta \mid x) \). Existing methods for evaluating the quality
of an NPE estimate are largely derived from classifier-based tests or
divergence measures, but these suffer from several practical drawbacks. As an
alternative, we introduce the \emph{Conditional Localization Test} (CoLT), a
principled method designed to detect discrepancies between \( p(\theta \mid x)
\) and \( q(\theta \mid x) \) across the full range of conditioning inputs.
Rather than relying on exhaustive comparisons or density estimation at every \(
x \), CoLT learns a localization function that adaptively selects points
$\theta_l(x)$ where the neural posterior $q$ deviates most strongly from the
true posterior $p$ for that $x$. This approach is particularly advantageous in
typical simulation-based inference settings, where only a single draw \( \theta
\sim p(\theta \mid x) \) from the true posterior is observed for each
conditioning input, but where the neural posterior \( q(\theta \mid x) \) can
be sampled an arbitrary number of times. Our theoretical results establish
necessary and sufficient conditions for assessing distributional equality
across all \( x \), offering both rigorous guarantees and practical
scalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoLT not only performs better
than existing methods at comparing $p$ and $q$, but also pinpoints regions of
significant divergence, providing actionable insights for model refinement.
These properties position CoLT as a state-of-the-art solution for validating
neural posterior estimates.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a discrete distribution $p$ with

estimator $\widehat{p}$, with probability at least $\delta$, $\text{KL}(p \|

averaging, and show that with probability at least $1 - \delta$ $\text{KL}(p \|
\widehat{p}) \leq C(K\log(\log(K)) + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)) /n$.
  Furthermore, we also show that with sufficiently many observations relative
to $\log(1/\delta)$, the maximum likelihood estimator $\bar{p}$ guarantees that
with probability at least $1-\delta$ $$
  1/6 \chi^2(\bar{p}\|p) \leq 1/4 \chi^2(p\|\bar{p}) \leq \text{KL}(p|\bar{p})

Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models
are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated
confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This
paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor
within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish
key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under
perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources
grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected
output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,
when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall
expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated
predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to
achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability
requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot
improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new
information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that
well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that
necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition
that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to
occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous
simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt
scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is
trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.
Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with
temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver
mobility.

Abstract: Differential privacy has become a cornerstone in the development of
privacy-preserving learning algorithms. This work addresses optimizing
differentially private kernel learning within the empirical risk minimization
(ERM) framework. We propose a novel differentially private kernel ERM algorithm
based on random projection in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space using
Gaussian processes. Our method achieves minimax-optimal excess risk for both
the squared loss and Lipschitz-smooth convex loss functions under a local
strong convexity condition. We further show that existing approaches based on
alternative dimension reduction techniques, such as random Fourier feature
mappings or $\ell_2$ regularization, yield suboptimal generalization
performance. Our key theoretical contribution also includes the derivation of
dimension-free generalization bounds for objective perturbation-based private
linear ERM -- marking the first such result that does not rely on noisy
gradient-based mechanisms. Additionally, we obtain sharper generalization
bounds for existing differentially private kernel ERM algorithms. Empirical
evaluations support our theoretical claims, demonstrating that random
projection enables statistically efficient and optimally private kernel
learning. These findings provide new insights into the design of differentially
private algorithms and highlight the central role of dimension reduction in
balancing privacy and utility.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that hazard ratios between treatment groups
estimated with the Cox model are uninterpretable because the indefinite
baseline hazard of the model fails to identify temporal change in the risk set
composition due to treatment assignment and unobserved factors among multiple,
contradictory scenarios. To alleviate this problem, especially in studies based
on observational data with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time
measurement of many covariates, we propose abandoning the baseline hazard and
using machine learning to explicitly model the change in the risk set with or
without latent variables. For this framework, we clarify the context in which
hazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on
Neyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of
hazard ratios. Computing the constructed estimators is more efficient than
computing those based on weighted regression with marginal structural Cox
models. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method identifies the
ground truth with minimal bias. These results lay the foundation for developing
a useful, alternative method for causal inference with uncontrolled,
observational data in modern epidemiology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯方法求解偏微分方程逆问题时需多次评估计算成本高的正向求解器，构建全局精确的替代模型对高维复杂问题要求高，需解决此计算成本和数据需求问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SBD - LAS算法框架能有效解决贝叶斯方法求解偏微分方程逆问题时的计算成本和数据需求问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) play a
crucial role in various fields, including computational science, image
processing, and engineering. Particularly, Darcy flow equation is a fundamental
equation in fluid mechanics, which plays a crucial role in understanding fluid
flow through porous media. Bayesian methods provide an effective approach for
solving PDEs inverse problems, while their numerical implementation requires
numerous evaluations of computationally expensive forward solvers. Therefore,
the adoption of surrogate models with lower computational costs is essential.
However, constructing a globally accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional
complex problems demands high model capacity and large amounts of data. To
address this challenge, this study proposes an efficient locally accurate
surrogate that focuses on the high-probability regions of the true likelihood
in inverse problems, with relatively low model complexity and few training data
requirements. Additionally, we introduce a sequential Bayesian design strategy
to acquire the proposed surrogate since the high-probability region of the
likelihood is unknown. The strategy treats the posterior evolution process of
sequential Bayesian design as a Gaussian process, enabling algorithmic
acceleration through one-step ahead prior. The complete algorithmic framework
is referred to as Sequential Bayesian design for locally accurate surrogate
(SBD-LAS). Finally, three experiments based the Darcy flow equation demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed method in terms of both inversion accuracy and
computational speed.

Result: 相比静态和部分自适应基线，在事实覆盖、连贯性和效率方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 在多智能体大语言模型系统中引入适应性和结构化竞争有益。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for
collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often
rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication,
reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper
proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core
mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent
evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence
and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and
crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of
the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular
architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage,
coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our
findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and
structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨实时多智能体路径规划（RT - MAPF）中规划预算分配策略，发现分配预算给各智能体的策略更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RT - MAPF解决方案未明确考虑规划预算大小，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 探索标准MAPF算法的窗口版本（Prioritized Planning和MAPF - LNS2）中不同的规划预算分配策略。

Result: 所有智能体共享规划预算池的基线方法在过度约束情况下效果不佳，分配规划预算给各智能体的策略能解决更多问题且总完成时间更短。

Conclusion: 分配规划预算给各智能体的策略在RT - MAPF中更有效。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for a set of
agents such that each agent reaches its desired destination while avoiding
collisions with the other agents. Many MAPF solvers are designed to run
offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them.
Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot
wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to
move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must
commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time,
referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively
call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without
explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and
explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed
versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and
MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents
draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained
situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the
agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.

Abstract: Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed
critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including
inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor
adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid
framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large
language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the
resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this
system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and
healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and
decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical
allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports
adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain
layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions
via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer
communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional
enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates
the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency,
fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This
research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust
guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a
robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under
uncertainty.

Result: 通过对真实参与式预算数据实验，发现公平妥协可通过小成本项目实现。

Conclusion: 多智能体深度强化学习建模的决策支持方法有效，小成本项目利于达成公平妥协。

Abstract: Participatory budgeting is a method of collectively understanding and
addressing spending priorities where citizens vote on how a budget is spent, it
is regularly run to improve the fairness of the distribution of public funds.
Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can
lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to
decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying
voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This
novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of
election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a
novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a
branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of
multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are
found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter
preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world
participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is
achievable through projects with smaller cost.

Conclusion: MPC平台有潜力实现可靠、可信赖的物理AI系统。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring
reliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks
offer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without
inherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical
domains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have
emerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty
quantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed
for deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This
poses a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic
processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this
challenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an
energy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic
magnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven
strategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and
their dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing
for AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW
stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic
functionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we
implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its
functionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS
implementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement
in the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,
energy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's
potential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems.

improves the crucial auxiliary role of the ASR model in industry CRM systems,
and this approach has also been adopted in actual industrial applications.

Conclusion: 提出的新方法能有效增强事件检测和源分离阶段协同性，提升声音场景空间语义分割性能。

Abstract: Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate
identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their
sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a
two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source
separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal
information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy
between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions
are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active
sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned
Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation
module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by
recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These
advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source
separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in
Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints
are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .

Motivation: 高维线性混合效应模型中基于采样的贝叶斯推理因随机效应协方差矩阵存在计算瓶颈，研究较少，需要解决此问题。

Method: 提出CME模型，通过对随机效应协方差进行随机投影得到低维协方差参数定义拟似然，结合对固定效应的全局 - 局部收缩先验，使用高效的压缩吉布斯采样器进行预测和固定效应选择。

Result: 理论上，当压缩维度相对于固定效应和观测值数量缓慢增长时，CME模型的预测贝叶斯风险渐近可忽略；实证上，在不同模拟设置和真实数据集上，CME模型在预测准确性、区间覆盖率和固定效应选择方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CME模型能有效解决高维线性混合效应模型中基于采样的贝叶斯推理的计算瓶颈问题，且在预测和固定效应选择上有更好表现。

Abstract: Penalized likelihood and quasi-likelihood methods dominate inference in
high-dimensional linear mixed-effects models. Sampling-based Bayesian inference
is less explored due to the computational bottlenecks introduced by the random
effects covariance matrix. To address this gap, we propose the compressed
mixed-effects (CME) model, which defines a quasi-likelihood using
low-dimensional covariance parameters obtained via random projections of the
random effects covariance. This dimension reduction, combined with a
global-local shrinkage prior on the fixed effects, yields an efficient
collapsed Gibbs sampler for prediction and fixed effects selection.
Theoretically, when the compression dimension grows slowly relative to the
number of fixed effects and observations, the Bayes risk for prediction is
asymptotically negligible, ensuring accurate prediction using the CME model.
Empirically, the CME model outperforms existing approaches in terms of
predictive accuracy, interval coverage, and fixed-effects selection across
varied simulation settings and a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: 所提方法在贝叶斯空间点模式推断中有效且计算高效。

Abstract: Bayesian inference for spatial point patterns is often hindered
computationally by intractable likelihoods. In the frequentist literature,
estimating equations utilizing pseudolikelihoods have long been used for
simulation-free parameter estimation. One such pseudolikelihood based on the
process of differences is known as the Palm likelihood. Utilizing notions of
Bayesian composite likelihoods and generalized Bayesian inference, we develop a
framework for the use of Palm likelihoods in a Bayesian context. Naive
implementation of the Palm likelihood results in posterior undercoverage of
model parameters. We propose two approaches to remedy this issue and calibrate
the resulting posterior. Numerical simulations illustrate both the efficacy of
the method in terms of statistical properties and the superiority in terms of
computational efficiency when compared to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo.
The method is then applied to the popular \textit{Beilschmiedia pendula
Lauraceae} dataset.

Result: 通过模拟和高血压数据的实际应用，表明该方法在准确性和稳健性上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决异常值对因果效应估计的影响，在处理含异常值数据时表现更优。

Abstract: Outliers can severely distort causal effect estimation in observational
studies, yet this issue has received limited attention in the literature. Their
influence is especially pronounced in small sample sizes, where detecting and
removing outliers becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore, it is essential to
estimate treatment effects robustly without excluding these influential data
points. To address this, we propose a doubly robust point estimator for the
average treatment effect under a contaminated model that includes outliers.
Robustness in outcome regression is achieved through a robust estimating
equation, while covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) ensure resilience
in propensity score modeling.
  To prevent model overfitting due to the inclusion of numerous parameters, we
incorporate variable selection. All these components are unified under a
penalized empirical likelihood framework. For confidence interval estimation,
most existing approaches rely on asymptotic properties, which may be unreliable
in finite samples. We derive an optimal finite-sample confidence interval for
the average treatment effect using our proposed estimating equation, ensuring
that the interval bounds remain unaffected by outliers. Through simulations and
a real-world application involving hypertension data with outliers, we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in
both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep
structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain
sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development
of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation
at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance
due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that
lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE
(SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate
layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced
sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further
optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear
approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting
them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence
levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate
high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs
without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for
deploying large language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of
the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones.
Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific
query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform
natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior
approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or
neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the
end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the
task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular,
interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for
planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool
for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.
Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the
Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other
participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning
systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths
annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide
attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),
including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied
AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary
classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.
This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs
from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to
end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,
including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error
analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match
accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior
performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,
indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal
systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight
the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only
demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical
classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured
EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored graph-based approaches to retrieval-augmented
generation, leveraging structured or semi-structured information -- such as
entities and their relations extracted from documents -- to enhance retrieval.
However, these methods are typically designed to address specific tasks, such
as multi-hop question answering and query-focused summarisation, and therefore,
there is limited evidence of their general applicability across broader

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their
native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the
agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to
implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available
general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking
precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient
domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific
datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual
synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from
agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our
evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the
fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results
highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning
as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture,
especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate
and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful
step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for
diverse linguistic communities.

Method: 提出一个使用工具的智能体系统，利用网络搜索和代码执行进行外部验证，独立于大语言模型的内部知识和偏差。

Result: 在三个目标响应领域和一般注释任务中进行大量实验，结果显示外部工具在很多情况下能提升性能，但对简单参数（如提示）敏感，且需要改进注释基准。

Conclusion: 外部工具可改善部分领域的注释性能，但存在局限性，需要改进注释基准。

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate
and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative
model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better"
response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded
metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping
model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise
comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for
responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh
writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore
augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve
performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and
code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality
feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to
ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal
knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our
method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation
tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as
three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our
results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many,
but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity
of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved
(non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language
processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are
key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations
(barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings
derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common
method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often
using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate
Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal
threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead
to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary
representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across
various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising
results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform
text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests
on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to
other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal
thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in
accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and
can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it
useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

Conclusion: 现有大语言模型在理解结构化知识方面存在不足，数据集和代码可在https://github.com/Lza12a/SKA - Bench获取。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations
for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific
capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a
more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to
diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a
Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used
structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a
three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a
question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To
evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we
expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,
Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical
evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,
indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding
structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as
the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination
phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 了解大语言模型与人类道德判断的一致性，因人们依赖大语言模型获取道德建议，但相关研究较少。

Method: 引入道德困境数据集，将问题视为多元分布对齐任务；使用从理由中提取的60值分类法；提出基于狄利克雷分布采样的动态道德剖析方法。

Result: 模型仅在高共识下能重现人类判断，人类分歧增加时对齐性急剧下降；大语言模型依赖的道德价值观比人类更窄；动态道德剖析方法使对齐性提高64.3%，增强了价值观多样性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型与人类道德判断存在多元道德差距，动态道德剖析方法有助于实现更多元、与人类对齐的道德指导。

Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice,
which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely
LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral
Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a
distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a
free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional
alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across
dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high
consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In
parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions
extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral
values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch
in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,
we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method
that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves
alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more
pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

Motivation: RAG中不同嵌入模型因训练数据和架构异构，导致不同领域表现和响应质量不同，需改进。

Method: 提出Mixture - Embedding RAG（基于标准化相似度排序选择检索结果）和Confident RAG（用不同嵌入模型多次生成响应，选置信度最高的）两种方法。

Result: Mixture - Embedding RAG未超普通RAG，Confident RAG比普通大模型和RAG平均提升约10%和5%。

Conclusion: Confident RAG是适用于各领域的高效即插即用方法，代码将发布。

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various
fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or
adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered
wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an
inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort
for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model
architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different
benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity
calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To
address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by
combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding
RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects
retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;
however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG
generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then
selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average
improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,
respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models
indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various
domains. We will release our code upon publication.

Result: 当前大语言模型多语言推理不佳，各模型处理不同推理任务有优劣，英文数学推理表现比原文好10%。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在原生多语言推理存在不足，处理含文化背景知识有挑战。

Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on
reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual
reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains
limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed
by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks
towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this
work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a
benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and
culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,
Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:
language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition
reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition
reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English
equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation
from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can
provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.
English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14
leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent
set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native
multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs
exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and
logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math
reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating
persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Result: 发现合并持续时间是影响模型性能的最关键因素，WSM在多个基准测试中显著优于WSD，在监督微调场景也有性能优势。

Conclusion: WSM框架有潜力用于长期模型优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the
effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay
phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have
emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present
Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal
connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a
unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including
cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model
averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization
methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training
window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model
performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge
quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted
Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving
significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on
MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning
scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

Conclusion: 清单与临床医生偏好显著一致，可作为评估方法，在离线研究中有助于识别低质量笔记。

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but
evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and
limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to
align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a
pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured
checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be
interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based
evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,
prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI
medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms
baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and
predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the
checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant
alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation
methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify
notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI
telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can
scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like
interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used
interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI
enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust
to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on
large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech
synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative
research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order
randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot
surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate
human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three
key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent
satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more
responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three
metrics studied.

Result: 验证方法的鲁棒性和抗数据污染能力，较弱法官也能区分更强辩论者。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了衡量高级语言模型真正推理能力的可持续途径。

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks,
concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset
creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that
transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where
one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and
defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the
correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach
substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet
reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:
(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based
assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's
effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized
protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of
the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model
fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)
but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can
reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based
evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a
fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework
underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need,"
offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of
advanced language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习裂纹检测方法泛化能力差，且以往方法忽略裂纹细结构特性。

Method: 利用裂纹细结构特性，先对裂纹图像进行最大池化和上采样操作得到粗无裂纹背景，再通过重建网络得到细无裂纹背景，二者差值得到细裂纹线索，并将其作为即插即用模块融入三个先进裂纹检测网络。

Result: 实验表明CrackCue显著提升了基线方法的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrackCue方法有效，可提升裂纹检测性能。

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有PRVR方法在欧氏空间存在几何失真，无法很好表示视频层次结构和语义，导致时间建模不佳。

Method: 提出HLFormer框架，集成Lorentz和欧氏注意力块在混合空间编码视频嵌入，用Mean - Guided模块动态融合特征，引入Partial Order Preservation Loss增强跨模态匹配。

Result: HLFormer在实验中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HLFormer通过利用双曲空间学习，能有效解决现有PRVR方法在欧氏空间的问题，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at
https://github.com/lijun2005/ICCV25-HLFormer.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持和增强台湾太空署开发的EVAP产品，优化遥感影像受灾区域分割。

Method: 从少量手动标注区域开始，用PCA特征空间分析和构建CI扩展标签得到弱监督训练集，用多波段影像训练ViT编码器 - 解码器模型，支持多解码器变体和多阶段损失策略。

Result: 模型预测与高分辨率EVAP输出对比，案例显示框架提升了分割结果的平滑度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 框架在缺乏准确地面真值时为灾害制图提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

Motivation: 单目3D人体姿态估计在实时和无约束环境中是具有挑战性的不适定问题，直接图像到3D方法有局限，需更好的解决方案。

Method: 结合实时2D关键点检测与几何感知2D到3D提升，利用相机内参和解剖学先验，基于自校准和逆运动学生成训练对。

Result: 可实现快速、个性化且准确的单目图像3D姿态估计，无需专用硬件。

Conclusion: 该提议有助于推动数据驱动学习和基于模型先验相结合，提升3D人体运动捕捉在边缘设备的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

Motivation: 现有MABSA方法存在跨模态对齐噪声、细粒度表示一致性不足等问题，全局模态对齐方法忽视方面术语与局部视觉区域联系，文本和图像表示差距难弥合。

Method: 提出CLAMP框架，包含渐进式注意力融合网络、多任务对比学习和自适应多损失聚合三个模块。

Result: 在标准公共基准上的评估显示，CLAMP始终优于绝大多数现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CLAMP框架能有效解决现有MABSA方法的问题，提升多模态方面情感分析性能。

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

TL;DR: 提出无训练的提示工程框架SIA，检测并减轻多模态输入有害意图，实验显示其安全性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中部署增多，图像和文本相互作用产生新安全风险，现有方法难以检测潜在风险。

Method: 提出SIA框架，采用三阶段推理过程：视觉抽象、意图推断、意图条件响应细化，动态适应图像 - 文本对隐含意图。

Result: 在多个安全关键基准测试中，SIA安全性能大幅提升，优于先前方法；在MMStar上一般推理准确性略有下降。

Conclusion: SIA体现了意图感知推理在使视觉语言模型符合以人为本价值观方面的价值。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法受相机和LiDAR特征未对齐影响，导致深度监督不准确和特征融合错误，本文旨在利用2D物体先验信息在融合前预对齐跨模态特征。

Method: 提出Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC)解决局部未对齐，引入Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)解决全局未对齐，结合Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM)有效融合特征。

Result: 在nuScenes验证数据集上取得了SOTA性能，mAP和NDS分别达到71.5%和73.6%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决LiDAR与相机特征未对齐问题，提升自动驾驶3D感知能力。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

Conclusion: 所提方法在现实场景中具有以用户为中心的视频高亮处理潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略多实体场景中复杂实体间关系，且缺乏高质量数据集，影响准确性和可靠性。

Method: 构建ReMeX数据集；提出ReMeREC框架，引入TMP和EIR；构建辅助数据集EntityText。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实验，ReMeREC在多实体定位和关系预测中达最优性能，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决多实体场景指代表达理解问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

Motivation: 现有视频基准测试无法严格评估视频因果和逐步推理能力，需设计新基准。

Method: 提出CausalStep基准，将视频分割为因果关联单元，采用严格逐步问答协议，设置干扰项，引入七个诊断指标。

Result: 对领先模型和人类基线实验表明，当前模型与人类逐步推理能力存在显著差距。

Conclusion: CausalStep提供了严格基准，可推动鲁棒且可解释的视频推理进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.

Conclusion: 现有策略不足以解决问题，需真正移除记忆内容的方法，新方法为构建更可信和合规的生成式AI奠定基础。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

Motivation: 亚细胞成分形态和分布多变，现有学习型细胞器分割模型存在特征学习偏差风险，SAM应用于亚细胞场景有标签空间差距和忽略细节等问题。

Method: 引入ScSAM方法，设计特征对齐和融合模块，提出基于余弦相似度矩阵的类提示编码器。

Result: 在不同亚细胞图像数据集上的大量实验表明ScSAM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ScSAM能有效增强特征鲁棒性，缓解数据不平衡导致的训练偏差，适用于亚细胞分割。

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Result: AURA能实现动态交互、上下文解释和假设检验。

Conclusion: 代理AI有望将医学图像分析从静态预测转变为交互式决策支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced
state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual
interpretability.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

Conclusion: 结合真假类别CAM的新训练方法能提高深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

Result: DesignLab优于现有设计生成方法，包括商业工具。

Conclusion: DesignLab通过迭代设计能产生精致、专业的幻灯片

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced
augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The
proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,
with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.

Motivation: 木材加工行业需准确高效识别木材种类和厚度，传统方法慢且易出错，因此研究实用机器学习框架。

Method: 采用YOLOv5目标检测算法，在公共数据集TimberSeg 1.0上微调，基于工业棚内木材交付时的图像进行训练。

Result: 模型的平均精度均值（mAP@0.5）达0.64，在有限计算资源下能可靠检测木材。

Conclusion: 该轻量级、可扩展的解决方案有望融入现有工作流程，尤其适用于中小型作业。

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.

Result: 在自建低信噪比数据集上实验，框架性能超现有方法，检测性能强，处理速度超1000 FPS。

Conclusion: 该框架无需人工标注，有潜力用于实际场景实时部署。

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for
assembling lightweight food image.

Conclusion: PMRL能以更稳定方式实现多模态同时对齐，且无锚依赖，具有优越性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

Result: 在SFUOD基准测试中取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的CollaPAUL框架有效。

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

Conclusion: HiProbe - VAD挖掘了预训练MLLMs在视频异常检测中的潜力，为更实用和可扩展的解决方案奠定基础。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

Result: SRMambaV2在定性和定量评估中表现出色。

Conclusion: SRMambaV2在汽车稀疏点云上采样任务中有效且具有实用价值。

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出用于无监督异常检测的AnoBFN，在阿尔茨海默病FDG PET图像异常检测任务中优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督异常检测在神经影像中很重要，贝叶斯流网络（BFNs）未应用于医学影像和异常检测，需拓展其应用。

Method: 引入AnoBFN，它是BFNs的扩展，能在高空间相关噪声下进行条件图像生成，并在生成过程中通过输入图像的递归反馈保留主体特异性。

Result: AnoBFN在阿尔茨海默病相关FDG PET图像异常检测任务中，优于基于VAEs、GANs和扩散模型的其他先进方法。

Conclusion: AnoBFN在检测异常方面有效，能降低误报率。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Motivation: 现有硬标签黑盒对抗攻击方法在射线搜索中查询成本高，需提高效率。

Method: 理论分析现有梯度估计质量，提出利用替代模型的基于迁移的先验，以查询高效的方式将其融入梯度估计。

Result: 在ImageNet和CIFAR - 10数据集上，该方法在查询效率上显著优于11种先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的先验引导方法能有效提高硬标签黑盒对抗攻击中射线搜索的效率。

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶模型因模型大、依赖昂贵LiDAR和计算密集的BEV特征表示，限制了其可扩展性，尤其是对仅配备相机的大众市场车辆。

Method: 提出PRIX架构，利用视觉特征提取器和生成式规划头，直接从原始像素输入预测安全轨迹，核心组件是Context - aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT)模块。

Result: PRIX在NavSim和nuScenes基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，推理速度和模型大小方面更高效。

Conclusion: PRIX是一个适合现实世界部署的实用解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and
the code will be at https://maxiuw.github.io/prix.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ViT在计算机视觉任务能力强，但与人类视觉注意力模式在美学情境下的对齐研究不足，本研究旨在探究评估手工制品时两者的相关性。

Method: 进行眼动追踪实验，记录30名参与者观看20件手工制品的注视模式并生成热图；用预训练的ViT模型分析相同物品，提取12个注意力头的注意力图；用Kullback - Leibler散度比较人类和ViT注意力分布。

Result: 在sigma = 2.4 +-0.03时相关性最佳，注意力头#12与人类视觉模式对齐最强；头#7和#9与人类注意力差异最大；ViT注意力更全局，特定注意力头能近似人类视觉行为。

Conclusion: ViT注意力机制在产品设计和美学评估有潜在应用，同时凸显人类感知和当前AI模型在注意力策略上的根本差异。

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,
video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,
we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion
Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an
autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise
control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic
optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the
high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves
remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and
model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will

Conclusion: Ultra3D在视觉保真度和用户偏好方面达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

Motivation: 细胞外记录的尖峰排序在低信噪比、电极漂移和跨会话变异性等情况下存在挑战。

Method: 提出HuiduRep框架，结合对比学习和去噪自编码器提取特征，构建无监督尖峰排序管道。

Result: 在混合和真实世界数据集上，HuiduRep有强鲁棒性，管道性能匹配或优于KiloSort4和MountainSort5等先进工具。

Conclusion: 自监督尖峰表征学习有潜力成为细胞外记录鲁棒和通用处理的基础工具。

Abstract: Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near
neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity
at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its
source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it
remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and
cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust
self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative
and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining
contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent
representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we
develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without
supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that
HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a
foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular
recordings.

Result: 实验在不同工业电路中RMSE始终低于0.0098，达到SPICE级精度。

Conclusion: 所提框架是传统功率和时序引擎的可扩展、结构适应性强的神经替代方案，高度符合物理电路行为。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of
multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based
analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load
simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard
cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform
prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and
propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical
parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method
accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without
requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,
we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from
each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across
the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete
waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction
utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level
encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality
constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary
delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate
SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse
industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally
adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines,
demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.

Result: 仿真表明该框架提高了低信噪比目标的检测概率，跟踪更准确。

Conclusion: 基于POMCP的框架在自适应、高效多目标雷达系统中有应用潜力。

Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for
joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target
algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend
it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree,
enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with
varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's
future angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated
range and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform
design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to
enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring
sufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to
prioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the
effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar
improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate
tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These
results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive,
efficient multi-target radar systems.

Conclusion: 基于代理的抽象为未来MR系统提供了强大且通用的交互范式。

Abstract: Interacting with real-world objects in Mixed Reality (MR) often proves
difficult when they are crowded, distant, or partially occluded, hindering
straightforward selection and manipulation. We observe that these difficulties
stem from performing interaction directly on physical objects, where input is
tightly coupled to their physical constraints. Our key insight is to decouple
interaction from these constraints by introducing proxies-abstract
representations of real-world objects. We embody this concept in Reality Proxy,
a system that seamlessly shifts interaction targets from physical objects to
their proxies during selection. Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality
Proxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical
spatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel
and previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming,
attribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object
selections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate
Reality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office
information retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control.
An expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting
that proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction
paradigm for future MR systems.

Conclusion: HypoChainer有潜力支持可解释、可扩展且基于知识的科学发现。

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery faces growing challenges in integrating vast and
heterogeneous knowledge critical to breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug
development. Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is
constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems,
and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models,
especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction
generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for
validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering
and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in
structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we
propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates
human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance
hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages:
First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented
LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN
predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain
formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions
and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG
suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are
filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates
for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in
reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in
two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support
interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.

Abstract: Mindfulness training is widely recognized for its benefits in reducing
depression, anxiety, and loneliness. With the rise of smartphone-based
mindfulness apps, digital meditation has become more accessible, but sustaining
long-term user engagement remains a challenge. This paper explores whether
respiration biosignal feedback and mindfulness skill estimation enhance system
usability and skill development. We develop a smartphone's accelerometer-based
respiration tracking algorithm, eliminating the need for additional wearables.
Unlike existing methods, our approach accurately captures slow breathing
patterns typical of mindfulness meditation. Additionally, we introduce the
first quantitative framework to estimate mindfulness skills-concentration,
sensory clarity, and equanimity-based on accelerometer-derived respiration
data. We develop and test our algorithms on 261 mindfulness sessions in both
controlled and real-world settings. A user study comparing an experimental
group receiving biosignal feedback with a control group using a standard app
shows that respiration feedback enhances system usability. Our respiration
tracking model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute,
closely aligning with ground truth data, while our mindfulness skill estimation
attains F1 scores of 80-84% in tracking skill progression. By integrating
respiration tracking and mindfulness estimation into a commercial app, we
demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness
training.

Abstract: Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the Distribution Semantics is a
leading approach to practical reasoning under uncertainty. An advantage of the
Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or
Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely
ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution
Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic
uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications
from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures
as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval
probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs
based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief
functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable
to practical applications.

Abstract: The present study considers the rural pharmaceutical retail sector in India,
where the arrival of organized retailers and e-retailers is testing the
survival strategies of unorganized retailers. Grounded in a field investigation
of the Indian pharmaceutical retail sector, this study integrates primary data
collection, consumer conjoint analysis and design of experiments to develop an
empirically grounded agent-based simulation of multi-channel competition among
unorganized, organized and e-pharmaceutical retailers. The results of the
conjoint analysis reveal that store attributes of price discount, quality of
products offered, variety of assortment, and degree of personalized service,
and customer attributes of distance, degree of mobility, and degree of
emergency are key determinants of optimal store choice strategies. The primary
insight obtained from the agent-based modeling is that the attribute levels of
each individual retailer have some effect on other retailers performance. The
field-calibrated simulation also evidenced counterintuitive behavior that an
increase in unorganized price discounts initially leads to an increase in
average footprint at unorganized retailers, but eventually leads to these
retailers moving out of the market. Hence, the unorganized retailers should not

### [219] [Weather-Aware AI Systems versus Route-Optimization AI: A Comprehensive Analysis of AI Applications in Transportation Productivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17099)
*Tatsuru Kikuchi*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究显示现有AI路线优化系统对出租车司机生产力提升有限，天气感知AI系统能大幅提高司机收入，表明应采用综合AI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注AI路线优化系统对出租车司机生产力的提升，未充分挖掘AI在交通领域的潜力，本研究旨在探讨综合天气感知AI系统的效果。

Method: 对比综合天气感知AI系统（集成深度学习气象预测和机器学习定位优化）与传统运营及仅路线优化AI方法，使用10000次出租车运营模拟数据。

Result: 天气感知AI系统使司机收入提高107.3%，气象预测对生产力提升贡献最大，经济分析显示司机年收入增加1380万日元，投资回报期短。

Conclusion: 当前AI文献低估了AI潜力，应采用综合方法应对多方面运营挑战，天气智能有89亿美元市场机会。

Abstract: While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve
taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture
only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive
weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction
with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance
against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation
data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that
weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\%
improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the
largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between
meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals
annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback
periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current
AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by
focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents
an untapped \$8.9 billion market opportunity. Our results indicate that future
AI implementations should adopt comprehensive approaches that address multiple
operational challenges simultaneously rather than optimizing isolated
functions.

*Louis Gleyo*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究法国高等教育平台Parcoursup的奖学金配额政策，发现其让奖学金学生进入更有选择性的项目，但对入学率无显著持久影响，不过能促进项目社会经济多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究法国高等教育平台Parcoursup实施的奖学金配额政策的效果。

Method: 采用双重差分法和匹配法。

Result: 配额使奖学金学生能进入更有选择性的项目，但平均处理意向效应较小；政策改善了奖学金学生的候补名单位置；对高等教育入学率无显著持久影响；不影响奖学金学生的申请行为和大学前投资。

Conclusion: 该政策主要使进入精英院校的弱势学生受益，而非扩大总入学率；种族中立的替代方案能有效促进著名项目的社会经济多样性。

Abstract: Since 2018, France's centralized higher education platform, Parcoursup, has
implemented quotas for scholarship recipients, with program-specific thresholds
based on the applicant's composition. Using difference-in-differences methods,
I find these quotas enabled scholarship students to access more selective
programs, though intention-to-treat effects remain modest (maximum 0.10 SD).
Matching methods reveal that the policy improved the scholarship students'
waiting list positions relative to those of comparable non-scholarship peers.
However, I detect no robust or lasting effects on the extensive margin of
higher education access. Despite high policy salience, quotas did not affect
the application behavior or pre-college investment of scholarship students,
even among high achievers. These findings align with research on affirmative
action bans, suggesting that such policies primarily benefit disadvantaged
students who access selective institutions, rather than expanding total
enrollment. Nevertheless, scholarship quotas demonstrate that race-neutral
alternatives can effectively promote socioeconomic diversity in prestigious
programs.

Motivation: 探讨家庭是否应该买房。

Method: 使用16个发达国家1870到2020年的数据进行研究。

Result: 与全股权投资策略相比，买房最多可提升9%的生命周期财富和23%的福利，能降低财富组合风险、改善财富平等，但会降低工作期财富和金融资产持有量；低收入家庭财富收益多，高收入家庭福利收益多，在利率适中偏低、房价高时买房收益最大。

Conclusion: 家庭应该买房。

Abstract: Should a household buy a home? Using data from 16 developed countries
spanning 1870 to 2020, this study provides a resounding affirmative answer.
Contrary to popular expert advice, homeownership enhances life cycle wealth by
up to 9% and welfare by up to 23%, compared to all-equity investment strategy.
Homeownership reduces wealth portfolio risk and improves wealth equality,
though it comes at the cost of lower working-life wealth and curtailed
financial asset holdings. Gains are heterogeneous: Low-income (high-income)
households gain more in wealth (welfare), and home purchase during periods of
moderately low interest rates and high housing prices maximizes these benefits.

Motivation: 变分量子算法参数空间大，不同方法和模拟器间结果和性能比较繁琐易出错，需一种通用方法在不同模拟器间移植问题定义。

Method: 采用哈密顿量和ansatz的通用描述方法在不同模拟器间一致移植问题定义，在HPC系统和软件模拟器上运行三个用例进行研究。

Result: 工具链能成功在不同模拟器间翻译问题定义，变分算法扩展性受长运行时间限制，使用作业数组等技术可部分缓解。

Conclusion: 强调了解析工具在探索HPC性能和比较变分算法模拟结果方面的潜力。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are of special importance in the research on
quantum computing applications because of their applicability to current Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The main building blocks of these
algorithms (among them, the definition of the Hamiltonian and of the ansatz,
the optimizer) define a relatively large parameter space, making the comparison
of results and performance between different approaches and software simulators
cumbersome and prone to errors. In this paper, we employ a generic description
of the problem, in terms of both Hamiltonian and ansatz, to port a problem
definition consistently among different simulators. Three use cases of
relevance for current quantum hardware (ground state calculation for the
Hydrogen molecule, MaxCut, Travelling Salesman Problem) have been run on a set
of HPC systems and software simulators to study the dependence of performance
on the runtime environment, the scalability of the simulation codes and the
mutual agreement of the physical results, respectively. The results show that
our toolchain can successfully translate a problem definition between different
simulators. On the other hand, variational algorithms are limited in their
scaling by the long runtimes with respect to their memory footprint, so they
expose limited parallelism to computation. This shortcoming is partially
mitigated by using techniques like job arrays. The potential of the parser tool
for exploring HPC performance and comparisons of results of variational
algorithm simulations is highlighted.

Method: 提出QuBound，分解历史性能轨迹分离噪声源，设计新编码器嵌入电路和噪声信息，用LSTM网络处理。

Result: 现有方法结果超出性能边界，QuBound预测契合边界，比模拟加速超106倍，范围比现有分析方法窄超10倍。

Conclusion: QuBound能有效预测量子计算性能边界，在效率和准确性上表现良好。

Abstract: Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting
devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential
quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses
significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact
is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the
next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient
and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job
scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of
jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional
objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum
device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is
vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and
scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely
QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical
performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to
embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art
learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value
instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing
approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our
QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds.
Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits
with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is
over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.

Result: 预测替代模型可将测量开销降低几个数量级，性能超越传统依赖大量量子资源的方法。

Conclusion: 预测替代模型是拓宽先进量子处理器影响的实用途径。

Abstract: The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in
scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating
large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable
future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we
introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning
models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor
with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two
predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum
processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential
in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a
quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling
efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of
transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet
symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the
predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of
magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,
quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish
predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of
advanced quantum processors.

Abstract: The Okada model is a widely used analytical solution for displacements and
strains caused by a point or rectangular dislocation source in a 3D elastic

a convenient wrapper interface for efficiently computing gradients and Hessians
with respect to either observation station coordinates or fault parameters.
This differentiable framework is well suited for fault parameter inversion,
including gradient-based optimization, Bayesian inference, and integration with
scientific machine learning (SciML) models. Our code is available here:

Conclusion: 为分析具有随机时间变化的从属模型提供了严格统一的概率框架，可应用于金融建模和不确定性下的推断。

Abstract: This paper explores a comprehensive class of time-changed stochastic
processes constructed by subordinating Brownian motion with Levy processes,
where the subordination is further governed by stochastic arrival mechanisms
such as the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) and Chan Karolyi Longstaff Sanders (CKLS)
processes. These models extend classical jump frameworks like the Variance
Gamma (VG) and CGMY processes, allowing for more flexible modeling of market
features such as jump clustering, heavy tails, and volatility persistence. We
first revisit the theory of Levy subordinators and establish strong consistency
results for the VG process under Gamma subordination. Building on this, we
prove asymptotic normality for both the VG and VGSA (VG with stochastic
arrival) processes when the arrival process follows CIR or CKLS dynamics. The
analysis is then extended to the more general CGMY process under stochastic
arrival, for which we derive analogous consistency and limit theorems under
positivity and regularity conditions on the arrival process. A simulation study
accompanies the theoretical work, confirming our results through Monte Carlo
experiments, with visualizations and normality testing (via Shapiro-Wilk
statistics) that show approximate Gaussian behavior even for processes driven
by heavy-tailed jumps. This work provides a rigorous and unified probabilistic
framework for analyzing subordinated models with stochastic time changes, with
applications to financial modeling and inference under uncertainty.

Result: 未提及明确结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: The objective of this Philosophiae Doctor (Ph.D) thesis is to propose an
efficient approach for optimizing a multidisciplinary black-box model when the
optimization problem is constrained and involves a large number of mixed
integer design variables (typically 100 variables). The targeted optimization
approach, called EGO, is based on a sequential enrichment of an adaptive
surrogate model and, in this context, GP surrogate models are one of the most
widely used in engineering problems to approximate time-consuming high fidelity
models. EGO is a heuristic BO method that performs well in terms of solution
quality. However, like any other global optimization method, EGO suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, meaning that its performance is satisfactory on
lower dimensional problems, but deteriorates as the dimensionality of the
optimization search space increases. For realistic aircraft design problems,
the typical size of the design variables can even exceed 100 and, thus, trying
to solve directly the problems using EGO is ruled out. The latter is especially
true when the problems involve both continuous and categorical variables
increasing even more the size of the search space. In this Ph.D thesis,
effective parameterization tools are investigated, including techniques like
partial least squares regression, to significantly reduce the number of design
variables. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is adapted to handle discrete
variables and high-dimensional spaces in order to reduce the number of
evaluations when optimizing innovative aircraft concepts such as the "DRAGON"
hybrid airplane to reduce their climate impact.

empirically show that constrained DC problems can be efficiently solved using a
combination of the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) algorithm

Result: 通过案例证明方法准确灵活，展示了即使特征函数不在所选空间，也可能出现谱特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛应用提供了稳健的谱估计工具。

Abstract: Koopman operator theory enables linear analysis of nonlinear dynamical
systems by lifting their evolution to infinite-dimensional function spaces.
However, finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman and transfer
(Frobenius--Perron) operators are prone to spectral pollution, introducing
spurious eigenvalues that can compromise spectral computations. While recent
advances have yielded provably convergent methods for Koopman operators,
analogous tools for general transfer operators remain limited. In this paper,
we present algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators
without spectral pollution, including extensions to the Hardy-Hilbert space.
Case studies--ranging from families of Blaschke maps with known spectrum to a
molecular dynamics model of protein folding--demonstrate the accuracy and
flexibility of our approach. Notably, we demonstrate that spectral features can
arise even when the corresponding eigenfunctions lie outside the chosen space,
highlighting the functional-analytic subtleties in defining the "true" Koopman
spectrum. Our methods offer robust tools for spectral estimation across a broad
range of applications.

Conclusion: SPHINCS+和HQC组合不适合安全关键但时间敏感的5G场景。

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of classical
public-key cryptographic systems, prompting the transition to post-quantum
cryptography (PQC). While PQC has been analyzed in theory, its performance in
practical wireless communication environments remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed implementation and performance evaluation of NIST-selected
PQC algorithms in user equipment (UE) to UE communications over 5G networks.
Using a full 5G emulation stack (Open5GS and UERANSIM) and PQC-enabled TLS 1.3
via BoringSSL and liboqs, we examine key encapsulation mechanisms and digital
signature schemes across realistic network conditions. We evaluate performance
based on handshake latency, CPU and memory usage, bandwidth, and retransmission
rates, under varying cryptographic configurations and client loads. Our
findings show that ML-KEM with ML-DSA offers the best efficiency for
latency-sensitive applications, while SPHINCS+ and HQC combinations incur
higher computational and transmission overheads, making them unsuitable for
security-critical but time-sensitive 5G scenarios.

Conclusion: ExplainVulD有更好检测性能，能输出可解释结果，支持安全分类的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging,
particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable
functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise
for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in
development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability,
limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents
ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code.
The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using
dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information.
These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates
edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class
imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss.
ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23
percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results
represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in
F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The
framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0
to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond
improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by
identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting
transparency and trust in security triage.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated
promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness
in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the
security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for
vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data
preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the
accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD,
an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and
large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the
performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their
effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing
settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction,
and semantic-preserving transformations.
  Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks
designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both
general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code
corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios,
such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies,
handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and
identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the
truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a
non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance
of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and
outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for
realistic VD applications.

can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating
realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive
framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core
of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing
toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide
learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance,
exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of
Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing
intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and
adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM
framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on
skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations.
Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the
effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between
theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research
demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to
meet evolving industry demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织快速迁移到云，HSM和TPM面临云原生威胁，现实中的安全漏洞暴露了其在云部署中的弱点，需要重新评估其有效性。

Method: 分析涉及HSM和TPM的显著安全失败案例，识别常见攻击向量，探索如机密计算、后量子密码学和去中心化密钥管理等替代方法。

Result: 发现HSM和TPM虽仍有作用，但现代云安全需要更自适应、分层的架构。

Conclusion: 研究为云架构师和安全工程师提供了在不断变化的威胁环境中增强加密信任的策略。

Abstract: As organizations rapidly migrate to the cloud, the security of cryptographic
key management has become a growing concern. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard
for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by
cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud
deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations,
allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections.
These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding
cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes
notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack
vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in
distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as
confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key
management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role,
modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By
evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips
cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce
cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape.

TL;DR: 提出CASPER框架用于检测区块链交易中的智能庞氏骗局，降低成本和复杂度，评估显示效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习庞氏骗局检测方法依赖大量标注数据，而此类数据稀缺，阻碍模型训练。

Method: 提出对比学习框架CASPER，利用对比学习技术从无标签数据中学习智能合约源代码的有效表示。

Result: 在XBlock数据集上评估，100%标注数据训练时F1分数比基线高2.3%，25%标注数据时比基线高近20%。

Conclusion: CASPER有潜力实现高效低成本的智能庞氏骗局检测，为未来可扩展的欺诈检测解决方案铺平道路。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital currency trading, fueled by the integration of
blockchain technology, has led to both innovation and the emergence of smart
Ponzi schemes. A smart Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation in
smart contract that uses funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier
investors. Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning
typically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of
labeled data. However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model
training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning
framework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more
negative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in
blockchain transactions. By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER
can learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using
unlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system
complexity. We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the
baseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. More
impressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly
20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions. These
results highlight CASPER's potential for effective and cost-efficient detection
of smart Ponzi schemes, paving the way for scalable fraud detection solutions
in the future.

TL;DR: 提出SynthCTI数据增强框架生成合成CTI句子，在两个数据集上评估显示能提升模型表现，小模型经增强后可超越未增强的大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTI挖掘中威胁描述映射到MITRE ATT&CK技术常手动进行，自动化方法面临高质量标注数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，现有工作多关注模型架构而非数据局限。

Method: 采用基于聚类的策略从训练数据中提取语义上下文，引导大语言模型生成词汇多样且语义一致的合成CTI句子。

Result: 在CTI-to-MITRE和TRAM数据集上，结合合成数据使模型宏观F1得分持续提升，如ALBERT从0.35提升到0.52，SecureBERT从0.4412提升到0.6558。

Conclusion: 数据生成方法对构建高效有效的CTI分类系统有价值。

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) mining involves extracting structured
insights from unstructured threat data, enabling organizations to understand
and respond to evolving adversarial behavior. A key task in CTI mining is
mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. However, this process
is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and substantial effort.
Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality
labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few
examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT
have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture
rather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI,
a data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI
sentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. Our method uses a
clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and
guide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse
and semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI
datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity.
Incorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for
example, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\%), and
SecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412). Notably, smaller models augmented
with SynthCTI outperform larger models trained without augmentation,
demonstrating the value of data generation methods for building efficient and
effective CTI classification systems.

*Na Li,Yansong Gao,Hongsheng Hu,Boyu Kuang,Anmin Fu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出CompLeak框架评估模型压缩隐私风险，有三种变体，在多种模型和数据集实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型压缩操作忽视压缩带来的隐私风险，需进行评估。

Method: 提出CompLeak框架，有CompLeakNR、CompLeakSR、CompLeakMR三种变体，利用不同模型组合挖掘隐私。

Result: 在七种模型架构和六个数据集上进行了大量实验。

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及明确结论，但暗示了CompLeak框架在评估模型压缩隐私风险上有一定作用。

Abstract: Model compression is crucial for minimizing memory storage and accelerating
inference in deep learning (DL) models, including recent foundation models like
large language models (LLMs). Users can access different compressed model
versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing
compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between
resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by
compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood.
  In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we
propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three
widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and
weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of
Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has
three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and
original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a
single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models
influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one
compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a
reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta
information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple
compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model,
CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed
versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct
extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to
foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark
datasets.

Motivation: 探究多种机器学习算法在静态恶意软件检测中的有效性。

Method: 使用EMBER数据集，评估8种分类模型在原始特征空间、PCA和LDA三种预处理设置下的表现，用多种指标评估模型，进行详细EDA。

Result: 集成方法尤其是LightGBM和XGBoost总体表现最佳，LDA提升KNN性能但降低提升模型准确率，TabNet在特征约简时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提升模型是高维静态恶意软件检测最可靠选择，降维应根据模型类型选择性应用，为恶意软件检测提供基准和见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning
algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains
feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight
classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees,
HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three
preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on
accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive
performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost,
show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal
sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance
but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising
in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural
sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed
exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or
t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local
Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features
in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most
reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that
dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type.
This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and
preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights
that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 融合先进计算机视觉模型与可证明安全机制，为沉浸式和隐私敏感应用的可靠AI奠定基础。

Abstract: In the era of synthetic media, deepfake manipulations pose a significant
threat to information integrity. To address this challenge, we propose
TrustDefender, a two-stage framework comprising (i) a lightweight convolutional
neural network (CNN) that detects deepfake imagery in real-time extended
reality (XR) streams, and (ii) an integrated succinct zero-knowledge proof
(ZKP) protocol that validates detection results without disclosing raw user
data. Our design addresses both the computational constraints of XR platforms
while adhering to the stringent privacy requirements in sensitive settings.
Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark deepfake datasets demonstrate
that TrustDefender achieves 95.3% detection accuracy, coupled with efficient
proof generation underpinned by rigorous cryptography, ensuring seamless
integration with high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By
fusing advanced computer vision models with provable security mechanisms, our
work establishes a foundation for reliable AI in immersive and
privacy-sensitive applications.

Method: 探索基于嵌入的相似度搜索方法，系统评估FAISS和ScaNN这两个向量搜索库在有生物学意义的基因嵌入上的表现，聚焦生物信息学特定嵌入并测试其检测新序列的能力。

Result: 在内存和运行时效率上有计算优势，且检索质量提高。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的相似度搜索方法是传统依赖比对工具的有前景替代方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of DNA sequencing data has outpaced traditional
heuristic-based methods, which struggle to scale effectively. Efficient
computational approaches are urgently needed to support large-scale similarity
search, a foundational task in bioinformatics for detecting homology,
functional similarity, and novelty among genomic and proteomic sequences.
Although tools like BLAST have been widely used and remain effective in many
scenarios, they suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and
poor performance on divergent sequences.
  In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn
latent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns
beyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art
vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene
embeddings. Unlike prior studies, our analysis focuses on
bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting
novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking
known homologs. Our results highlight both computational advantages (in memory
and runtime efficiency) and improved retrieval quality, offering a promising
alternative to traditional alignment-heavy tools.

Abstract: Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for
effective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to
subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches
fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting
their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four
standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS
scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,
combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual
State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To
improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based
fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively
handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across
diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models
against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and
multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently
outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,
the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.
For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of
0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.
These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and
underscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for
improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography
analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate
pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic
analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks
that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However,
current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained
reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive
chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to
simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest
(ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as
ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI)
classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present
SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both
ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning
capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and
task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for
chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM.
Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through
a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks.
We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI
samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks
validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work
represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced
AI systems for precision pathology.

Conclusion: Mammo - Mamba能有效缓解传统Transformer模型的局限，是多视图乳房X光片分类的有效方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality among women, despite recent advances in Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) systems. Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms
is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view
mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures,
their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image
patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this
challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective
State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven
feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the
MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE)
mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified
MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution
mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These
blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model
to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,
effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.
Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior
classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural
texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of
cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients
are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states
and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a
method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the
domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well
LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We
first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate
annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and
controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to
evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify
ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used
LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state
knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving
performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

Method: 利用开源模型Llama - 3 - Instruct、Mistral - 7B - Instruct、Gemma - 7B - IT通过提示工程，结合GPT - 2、BERT、RoBERTa使用联合嵌入技术。

Result: 模型能预测用户社交演变阶段，GPT - 2在跨模态配置中困惑度最低（8.21），优于RoBERTa（9.11）和BERT。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，能应对社交媒体关键挑战，提供用户行为轨迹洞察，可预警潜在负面结果，助用户决策和降低风险。

Abstract: Social media platforms serve as a significant medium for sharing personal
emotions, daily activities, and various life events, ensuring individuals stay
informed about the latest developments. From the initiation of an account,
users progressively expand their circle of friends or followers, engaging
actively by posting, commenting, and sharing content. Over time, user behavior
on these platforms evolves, influenced by demographic attributes and the
networks they form. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages
open-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through
prompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint
embedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on
social media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of
these models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including
network changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities.
Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2
achieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration,
outperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of
leveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach
addresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations
and activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user
behavior. By anticipating future interactions and activities, this research
aims to provide early warnings about potential negative outcomes, enabling
users to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in the long term.

informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate
that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and
cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened
awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality
assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and
summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to
comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the

policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster
informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究在用户和网络建模、考虑网络动态行为及修正策略定量评估方面存在不足，需填补这些空白以理解社交机器人在人 - 机共生信息生态系统中的影响，实现风险控制和更好治理。

Method: 提出MADD框架，集成BA模型和SBM模型构建传播网络，基于真实用户数据设计节点属性，纳入恶意和合法机器人，通过个体和群体层面指标评估。

Result: 实验验证了MADD用户属性和网络结构与现实世界的一致性，模拟六个虚假信息主题传播，展示了基于事实和叙事的修正策略的不同效果。

Conclusion: MADD框架能更有效地分析社交机器人在虚假信息传播和修正中的作用，为虚假信息治理提供支持。

Abstract: In the human-bot symbiotic information ecosystem, social bots play key roles
in spreading and correcting disinformation. Understanding their influence is
essential for risk control and better governance. However, current studies
often rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook the dynamic
behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. To
fill these gaps, we propose MADD, a Multi Agent based framework for
Disinformation Dissemination. MADD constructs a more realistic propagation
network by integrating the Barabasi Albert Model for scale free topology and
the Stochastic Block Model for community structures, while designing node
attributes based on real world user data. Furthermore, MADD incorporates both
malicious and legitimate bots, with their controlled dynamic participation
allows for quantitative analysis of correction strategies. We evaluate MADD
using individual and group level metrics. We experimentally verify the real
world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure, and we
simulate the dissemination of six disinformation topics, demonstrating the
differential effects of fact based and narrative based correction strategies.

Result: 建立通用图SPIR容量下界，证明消息特定随机性最小规模等于消息大小，得到路径和正则图的精确SPIR容量。

Conclusion: 明确了简单图模型下复制数据库SPIR的容量相关性质和精确容量。

Abstract: We introduce the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) on
replicated databases modeled by a simple graph. In this model, each vertex
corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only
if there is an edge between them. We consider the setting where the server-side
common randomness necessary to accomplish SPIR is also replicated at the
servers according to the graph, and we call this as message-specific common
randomness. In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity,
i.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable
SPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the
minimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a
message. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR
capacity for the class of path and regular graphs.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by applications such as sparse PCA, in this paper we present
provably-accurate one-pass algorithms for the sparse approximation of the top
eigenvectors of extremely massive matrices based on a single compact linear
sketch. The resulting compressive-sensing-based approaches can approximate the
leading eigenvectors of huge approximately low-rank matrices that are too large
to store in memory based on a single pass over its entries while utilizing a
total memory footprint on the order of the much smaller desired sparse
eigenvector approximations. Finally, the compressive sensing recovery algorithm
itself (which takes the gathered compressive matrix measurements as input, and
then outputs sparse approximations of its top eigenvectors) can also be
formulated to run in a time which principally depends on the size of the sought
sparse approximations, making its runtime sublinear in the size of the large
matrix whose eigenvectors one aims to approximate. Preliminary experiments on
huge matrices having $\sim 10^{16}$ entries illustrate the developed theory and
demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed approach.

### [250] [On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654)
*Gyanendra K. Verma,Abhay Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize
redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded
data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of
metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations
must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by
Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\
l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over
$\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over
$\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim
to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular
Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy
by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general
bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions,
including Lee-local functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight
distribution functions, leading to improved some bounds compared to those of
Liu and Liu [6] over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and generalize the other bounds over
$\mathbb{Z}_m$ in the Lee metric.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现快速3D头像重建，使重建外观无缝集成到下游应用，保护面部隐私和减少通信带宽。

Method: 提出StreamME方法，基于3DGS，采用即时训练策略，引入基于主点的简化策略。

Result: 提高了对面部表情的适应速度，在即时训练中保证了高效率。

Conclusion: 该方法可保护面部隐私、减少通信带宽，能直接应用于动画、卡通化和重打光等下游应用。

Abstract: We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The
StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video
streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the
reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast
training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our
approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating
the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which
significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further
ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification
strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more
sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining
rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method
protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or
online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream
application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our
project page for more details: https://songluchuan.github.io/StreamME/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP随机优化过程对结果的影响未被充分探索，且常产生不稳定结果。

Method: 引入(r,d)-stability框架分析投影空间中数据点的随机定位；引入“ghosts”评估随机元素影响；定义(r,d)-稳定；开发自适应丢弃方案；提供可视化工具。

Result: 自适应丢弃方案将运行时间减少60%，保留约90%不稳定点。

Conclusion: 框架有效，给出了框架的使用指南。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP), the impact of its stochastic optimization process on the results
remains underexplored. We observed that it often produces unstable results
where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather
than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we
introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic
positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic
elements, specifically initial projection positions and negative sampling,
impact UMAP results, we introduce "ghosts", or duplicates of data points
representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a
data point's projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle
of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius
d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we
develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared
to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable
points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive
exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of
real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our
framework.

Conclusion: 所提分层优化框架能有效解决异构无人机网络推进能量约束下的物理层安全问题，提升保密率和能效。

Abstract: This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the
secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy
constraints. Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or
overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where
UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve
ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex
coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical
optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex
(d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV
positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided
heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for
trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics
policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware,
security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM
calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing
baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness
across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.

Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for
solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network,
combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct
bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural
network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze
solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The
effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on
the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference
method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are
employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural
network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more
accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves
effective for linear stability analysis.

Abstract: Iterative solvers for large-scale linear systems such as Krylov subspace
methods can diverge when the linear system is ill-conditioned, thus
significantly reducing the applicability of these iterative methods in practice
for high-performance computing solutions of such large-scale linear systems. To
address this fundamental problem, we propose general algorithmic frameworks to
modify Krylov subspace iterative solution methods which ensure that the
algorithms are stable and do not diverge. We then apply our general frameworks
to current implementations of the corresponding iterative methods in SciPy and
demonstrate the efficacy of our stable iterative approach with respect to
numerical experiments across a wide range of synthetic and real-world
ill-conditioned linear systems.

Motivation: 最优输电开关（OTS）的混合整数公式增加了计算复杂度，特别是在大电网中，需要一种方法加速DC - OTS。

Method: 提出DA - DNN预测线路状态，通过可微DC - OPF层，以发电成本为损失函数，采用定制的权重偏置初始化。

Result: 训练后的DA - DNN能在求解DCOPF的时间内产生可行的拓扑和调度对，而传统混合整数求解器变得难以处理。

Conclusion: 所提方法成功捕捉了OTS的经济优势，同时保持了可扩展性。

Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by
selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation
increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with
this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates
DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and
passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting
generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints
are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a
customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible
from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once
trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch
pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer
solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully
captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of
building energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been
explored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely
data-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths
of both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as
learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between
simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world
measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven
models, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the
data-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain.
First, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting
the inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and
occupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a
probabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating
five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy
modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a
real-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the
performance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types,
but residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on
average. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces
physically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data.
Second, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating
quantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.

Abstract: We present a graph-based deep learning framework for predicting the magnetic

encoded as a graph and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) followed by
fully connected layers. The model is trained on Monte Carlo simulation data and
accurately reproduces key features of the magnetization curve, including
plateaus, critical transition points, and the effects of geometric frustration.
It captures both local motifs and global symmetries, demonstrating that GNNs
can infer magnetic behavior directly from structural connectivity. The proposed
approach enables efficient prediction of magnetization without the need for
additional Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution
facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze
subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic
images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we
automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations
of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine
learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and
directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an
emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate
high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract
latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation
errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification
and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively
correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This
facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled
frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for
the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A
main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance
functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we derive
physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an
incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These
kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the
incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the
profile in a continuous manner. Such physical and boundary constraints can be
applied to any pre-defined scalar kernel in the proposed methodology, which is
very general and can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of
engineering applications. Its relevance and performances are illustrated by
numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil
profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.

Abstract: Fatigue detection plays a critical role in safety-critical applications such
as aviation, mining, and long-haul transport. However, most existing methods
rely on high-end sensors and controlled environments, limiting their
applicability in real world settings. This paper formally defines a practical
yet underexplored problem setting for real world fatigue detection, where
systems operating with context-appropriate sensors aim to leverage knowledge
from differently instrumented sources including those using impractical sensors
deployed in controlled environments. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
heterogeneous and multi-source fatigue detection framework that adaptively
utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while benefiting from
the diverse configurations present in source domains. Our experiments,
conducted using a realistic field-deployed sensor setup and two publicly
available datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved
generalization of our approach, paving the practical way for effective fatigue
monitoring in sensor-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Building general-purpose intelligent robots has long been a fundamental goal
of robotics. A promising approach is to mirror the evolutionary trajectory of
humans: learning through continuous interaction with the environment, with
early progress driven by the imitation of human behaviors. Achieving this goal
presents three core challenges: (1) designing safe robotic hardware with
human-level physical capabilities; (2) developing an intuitive and scalable
whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection; and (3) creating
algorithms capable of learning whole-body visuomotor policies from human
demonstrations. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we propose
Astribot Suite, a robot learning suite for whole-body manipulation aimed at
general daily tasks across diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our system on a wide range of activities that require
whole-body coordination, extensive reachability, human-level dexterity, and
agility. Our results show that Astribot's cohesive integration of embodiment,
teleoperation interface, and learning pipeline marks a significant step towards
real-world, general-purpose whole-body robotic manipulation, laying the
groundwork for the next generation of intelligent robots.

Motivation: 解决多智能体联合预测中低概率模式生成质量低的挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段多智能体交互预测框架JAM，第一阶段为边缘预测，按轨迹类型分类查询；第二阶段为联合预测，结合场景上下文和第一阶段提议，引入关键路点引导。

Conclusion: JAM框架在交互式轨迹预测中性能良好，代码开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: Predicting the future motion of road participants is a critical task in
autonomous driving. In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality
generation of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle
this issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework
named \textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware
marginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction
process, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to
learn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information
for the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint
prediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals
from the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We
explicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in
better capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial
predicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world
Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show
that our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the
framework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction
frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory
prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/LinFunster/JAM to

Result: 方法能确保无碰撞导航，轮椅定向合理，平滑性优于非学习方法，完成了从仿真到现实的迁移。

Conclusion: 实现了全向移动平台基于RL的共享控制在现实世界的首次应用。

Abstract: Smart electric wheelchairs can improve user experience by supporting the
driver with shared control. State-of-the-art work showed the potential of
shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots.
However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive
behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional
driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which
takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and
reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and
tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and
reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort.
We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly
orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared
to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real
transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world
implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility
platform.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理可变形物体簇操作，实现策略从仿真到真实环境的迁移。

Abstract: Manipulating clusters of deformable objects presents a substantial challenge
with widespread applicability, but requires contact-rich whole-arm
interactions. A potential solution must address the limited capacity for
realistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of
efficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for
learning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and
proprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body
contact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our
reinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state
representation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training
efficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel
context-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region
for exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario
and observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple
arm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy
transfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion
patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.

Motivation: 在不确定任务需求的环境中，通用工具无预设使用策略，机器人需学习既完成任务又延长工具寿命的使用策略。

Method: 引入强化学习框架，利用有限元分析和Miner法则估算剩余使用寿命并融入奖励函数，采用自适应奖励归一化机制确保学习信号稳定。

Result: 在模拟和现实工具使用任务中，学习到的策略能延长工具寿命（模拟中最高达8.01倍），且能有效迁移到现实场景。

Conclusion: 学习寿命引导的工具使用策略具有实际价值。

Abstract: In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely
on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are
not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive
to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot
learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's
lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a
factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based
on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide
policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL
can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward
Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on
estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across
simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and
Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies
consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer
effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of
learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.

Motivation: 现有Vision - Language - Action (VLA)模型缺乏触觉信号解读和使用能力，在接触密集任务中效果受限，且缺乏多模态数据集使融入触觉反馈有挑战。

Method: 引入两个关键创新：利用预训练触觉语言模型为高级任务规划提供语义触觉反馈的管道；基于扩散的控制器用触觉信号优化VLA生成的动作以进行接触密集操作。

Result: 通过真实世界实验，证明双级触觉反馈集成提高了任务规划效率并增强了执行精度。

Conclusion: VLA - Touch方法能在不微调基础VLA的情况下，有效利用触觉反馈提升机器人在接触密集任务中的表现。

Abstract: Tactile feedback is generally recognized to be crucial for effective
interaction with the physical world. However, state-of-the-art
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use
tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks.
Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the
absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that
enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without
fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a
pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides
semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a
diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile
signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task
planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision. Code is open-sourced

Conclusion: 旨在开发通过可靠不确定性量化使 VLA 兼具高性能和高可信度所需的工具和概念理解。

Abstract: Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but
also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this
end, we present the first systematic study of confidence calibration in
vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations
and natural-language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We begin
with extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between
task success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants,
finding that task performance and calibration are not in tension. Next, we
introduce prompt ensembles for VLAs, a lightweight, Bayesian-inspired algorithm
that averages confidence across paraphrased instructions and consistently
improves calibration. We further analyze calibration over the task time
horizon, showing that confidence is often most reliable after making some
progress, suggesting natural points for risk-aware intervention. Finally, we
reveal differential miscalibration across action dimensions and propose
action-wise Platt scaling, a method to recalibrate each action dimension
independently to produce better confidence estimates. Our aim in this study is
to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render
VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty
quantification.

Result: 在自定义室内数据集展示了IndoorBEV的有效性。

Conclusion: IndoorBEV能有效捕捉静态和动态物体的足迹，为室内场景理解提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Detecting diverse objects within complex indoor 3D point clouds presents
significant challenges for robotic perception, particularly with varied object
shapes, clutter, and the co-existence of static and dynamic elements where
traditional bounding box methods falter. To address these limitations, we
propose IndoorBEV, a novel mask-based Bird's-Eye View (BEV) method for indoor
mobile robots.
  In a BEV method, a 3D scene is projected into a 2D BEV grid which handles
naturally occlusions and provides a consistent top-down view aiding to
distinguish static obstacles from dynamic agents. The obtained 2D BEV results
is directly usable to downstream robotic tasks like navigation, motion
prediction, and planning. Our architecture utilizes an axis compact encoder and
a window-based backbone to extract rich spatial features from this BEV map. A
query-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently
predict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric
formulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic
objects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding
box regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndoorBEV on a custom
indoor dataset featuring diverse object classes including static objects
  and dynamic elements like robots and miscellaneous items, showcasing its
potential for robust indoor scene understanding.

Motivation: 多数MDD系统基于GOP需预分割语音，限制方法准确性和使用现代基于CTC声学模型评估的可能性。

Method: 提出GOP - SA使基于CTC训练的ASR模型用于MDD，定义GOP - AF考虑目标音素所有可能对齐，给出理论解释、解决数值问题的实现和归一化方法。

Result: 在CMU Kids和Speechocean762数据集上广泛实验，比较不同方法定义，估计GOP - AF对声学模型峰值和目标音素上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 所提方法导出的特征向量在音素级发音评估上达SOTA。

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in
modern computer aided language learning (CALL) systems. Within MDD,
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve
their pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of
pronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic
units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use
modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first
propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR
models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes
all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a
theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves
potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the
method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We
provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762
datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the
dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount
of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with
recent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors
derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

Result: 1. 文本模型性能与语音特征模型相当；2. 多语言Whisper优于自监督模型，单语言Whisper较差；3. AudioSet预训练提升SVP任务性能，对自发语音无效。

Conclusion: 语言在帕金森病早期检测中起关键作用。

Abstract: Using speech samples as a biomarker is a promising avenue for detecting and
monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is
considerable disagreement in the literature about how best to collect and
analyze such data. Early research in detecting PD from speech used a sustained
vowel phonation (SVP) task, while some recent research has explored recordings
of more cognitively demanding tasks. To assess the role of language in PD
detection, we tested pretrained models with varying data types and pretraining
objectives and found that (1) text-only models match the performance of
vocal-feature models, (2) multilingual Whisper outperforms self-supervised
models whereas monolingual Whisper does worse, and (3) AudioSet pretraining
improves performance on SVP but not spontaneous speech. These findings together
highlight the critical role of language for the early detection of Parkinson's
disease.

Conclusion: SAEs有潜力揭示用于疾病监测和诊断的临床相关生物标志物。

Abstract: Speech holds promise as a cost-effective and non-invasive biomarker for
neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). While deep learning
systems trained on raw audio can find subtle signals not available from
hand-crafted features, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption. To
address this, we apply sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to uncover interpretable
internal representations from a speech-based PD detection system. We introduce
a novel mask-based activation for adapting SAEs to small biomedical datasets,
creating sparse disentangled dictionary representations. These dictionary
entries are found to have strong associations with characteristic articulatory
deficits in PD speech, such as reduced spectral flux and increased spectral
flatness in the low-energy regions highlighted by the model attention. We
further show that the spectral flux is related to volumetric measurements of
the putamen from MRI scans, demonstrating the potential of SAEs to reveal
clinically relevant biomarkers for disease monitoring and diagnosis.

Abstract: High-quality speech generation for low-resource languages, such as many
Indian languages, remains a significant challenge due to limited data and
diverse linguistic structures. Duration prediction is a critical component in
many speech generation pipelines, playing a key role in modeling prosody and
speech rhythm. While some recent generative approaches choose to omit explicit
duration modeling, often at the cost of longer training times. We retain and
explore this module to better understand its impact in the linguistically rich
and data-scarce landscape of India. We train a non-autoregressive Continuous
Normalizing Flow (CNF) based speech model using publicly available Indian
language data and evaluate multiple duration prediction strategies for
zero-shot, speaker-specific generation. Our comparative analysis on
speech-infilling tasks reveals nuanced trade-offs: infilling based predictors
improve intelligibility in some languages, while speaker-prompted predictors
better preserve speaker characteristics in others. These findings inform the
design and selection of duration strategies tailored to specific languages and
tasks, underscoring the continued value of interpretable components like
duration prediction in adapting advanced generative architectures to
low-resource, multilingual settings.

Abstract: In speaker verification, contrastive learning is gaining popularity as an
alternative to the traditionally used classification-based approaches.
Contrastive methods can benefit from an effective use of hard negative pairs,
which are different-class samples particularly challenging for a verification
model due to their similarity. In this paper, we propose CHNS - a
clustering-based hard negative sampling method, dedicated for supervised
contrastive speaker representation learning. Our approach clusters embeddings
of similar speakers, and adjusts batch composition to obtain an optimal ratio
of hard and easy negatives during contrastive loss calculation. Experimental
evaluation shows that CHNS outperforms a baseline supervised contrastive
approach with and without loss-based hard negative sampling, as well as a
state-of-the-art classification-based approach to speaker verification by as
much as 18 % relative EER and minDCF on the VoxCeleb dataset using two
