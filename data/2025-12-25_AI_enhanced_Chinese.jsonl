I introduce Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm that reconceptualizes intelligence as emergent from the coordination of multiple \"brains\", rather than a single one. At its core, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes the exact loss gradient $$ \\mathbf{G}_i = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}_i} $$ as a dynamic, VCG-equivalent incentive signal, guaranteeing Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and convergence to the global optimum. A Bayesian extension ensures incentive compatibility under asymmetric information (BIC). The framework scales linearly ($\\mathcal{O}(N)$) with the number of agents, bypassing the combinatorial complexity of Dec-POMDPs and is empirically 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning.

This keeps normal-case costs low and, if at least one honest challenger exists, can catch fraud. What has been less clear is whether honest challengers are actually incentivized and a dishonest proposer is properly damaged under the worst case environment. We build a model with a colluding minority, heterogeneous costs, and three ordering modes. We then ask whether two goals can be met together: honest non-loss and fraud deterrence.

However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \\textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \\textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests.

Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are costly, time-consuming, and carry procedural risks. To date, no study has sought to quantify CMD indices using data-driven approaches while leveraging the rich information contained in coronary angiograms. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel data-driven framework for inference of CMD indices based on coronary angiography. A physiologically validated multi-physics model was used to generate synthetic datasets for data-driven model training, consisting of CMD indices and computational angiograms with corresponding contrast intensity profiles (CIPs). Two neural network architectures were developed: a single-input-channel encoder-MLP model for IMR prediction and a dual-input-channel encoder-MLP model for CFR prediction, both incorporating epistemic uncertainty estimation to quantify prediction confidence. Results demonstrate that the data-driven models achieve high predictive accuracy when evaluated against physics-based synthetic datasets, and that the uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with prediction errors. Furthermore, the utility of CIPs as informative surrogates for coronary physiology is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of the proposed framework to enable accurate, real-time, image-based CMD assessment using routine angiography without the need for more invasive approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u65adCMD\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eCIPs\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u521bCMD\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\uff08CMD\uff09\u4e34\u5e8a\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u800c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u65e0\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u91cf\u5316CMD\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u751f\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - MLP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bIMR\u3001\u53cc\u8f93\u5165\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - MLP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bCFR\uff0c\u5747\u5305\u542b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eCIPs\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u751f\u7406\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u8840\u7ba1\u9020\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684CMD\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows.

While Zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods sidestep the need for labeled training data by leveraging pretrained vision-language models, they often rely on a single fused query that merges all descriptive cues of what the user wants, tending to dilute key information and failing to account for what they wish to avoid. Moreover, current CIR benchmarks assume a single correct target per query, overlooking the ambiguity in modification texts. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Filtering with Textual constraints (SoFT), a training-free, plug-and-play filtering module for ZS-CIR. SoFT leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to extract two complementary constraints from the reference-modification pair: prescriptive (must-have) and proscriptive (must-avoid) constraints. These serve as semantic filters that reward or penalize candidate images to re-rank results, without modifying the base retrieval model or adding supervision. In addition, we construct a two-stage dataset pipeline that refines CIR benchmarks. We first identify multiple plausible targets per query to construct multi-target triplets, capturing the open-ended nature of user intent. Then guide multimodal LLMs to rewrite the modification text to focus on one target, while referencing contrastive distractors to ensure precision. This enables more comprehensive and reliable evaluation under varying ambiguity levels. Applied on top of CIReVL, a ZS-CIR retriever, SoFT raises R@5 to 65.25 on CIRR (+12.94), mAP@50 to 27.93 on CIRCO (+6.13), and R@50 to 58.44 on FashionIQ (+4.59), demonstrating broad effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff08ZS - CIR\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757SoFT\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ba1\u9053\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ZS - CIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4f1a\u7a00\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u60f3\u907f\u514d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524dCIR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4fee\u6539\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoFT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u53c2\u8003 - \u4fee\u6539\u5bf9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7981\u6b62\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u6539\u5199\u4fee\u6539\u6587\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIReVL\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528SoFT\uff0c\u5728CIRR\u3001CIRCO\u548cFashionIQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86R@5\u3001mAP@50\u548cR@50\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "SoFT\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u7cca\u5ea6\u4e0b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

This paper estimates the size of the economy-wide rebound effect using time-varying Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models with stochastic volatility for U.S. business-cycle peak and trough periods. All models estimate a rebound effect close to 100%, with reductions in energy use lasting no longer than three years following energy efficiency innovations. The latter, therefore, are an insufficient tool for effectively changing historical energy use patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u542b\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5468\u671f\u5cf0\u8c37\u671f\u7684\u5168\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8303\u56f4\u56de\u5f39\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u521b\u65b0\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8d85\u4e09\u5e74\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u53d8\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u56de\u5f39\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8282\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u7f13\u89e3\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u542b\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08VAR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5468\u671f\u7684\u5cf0\u8c37\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u56de\u5f39\u6548\u5e94\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u521b\u65b0\u540e\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u6301\u7eed\u4e0d\u8d85\u4e09\u5e74\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u6548\u521b\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u53d8\u5386\u53f2\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations.

We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem.

We first define a general notion of $(\u03b1,\u03b2)$-fairness, where, for parameters $\u03b1\\ge 1$ and $\u03b2\\ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $\u03b1/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $\u03b2$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(\u03b1,\u03b2)$-fair solution for $\u03b1= 1 + \\varepsilon$ and $\u03b2= O(\\mathrm{diam} \\cdot \\log k / \\varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\\mathrm{diam} \\cdot k \\log k / \\varepsilon)$ term. Here $\\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss.\n  The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$.

Missing observations shift recommendations toward frequently interacted items, which reduces the diversity of the recommendation list. To alleviate this problem, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) is widely used and commonly models propensities based on a power-law function of item interaction frequency. However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness.

We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness.

These tasks present stochastic payoffs and stochastic prices, respectively. The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to compare gender-specific responses across three experimental designs.\n  Findings: The key results of the study indicate that women typically exhibit higher degrees of PaRA than men, which is a consistent finding with the mainstream literature. However, remarkably, the results from all the three indirect MCL designs show that women typically exhibit lower degrees of PrRA than men, and this result is robust across different MCL designs. The paper also introduces an 'irrationality gap' as the difference between PaRA and PrRA and explores the size of the irrationality gap within either gender group, finding it larger and statistically significant for men, while smaller and statistically insignificant for women.\n  Originality/value: This study is the first to distinguish between PaRA and PrRA in a gender comparison, using experimentally validated methods.

The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards.

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u672a\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9Transformer\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4f5c\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u52a8\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u632f\u8361\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c06\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63ed\u793aTransformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5f02\u6784GPU\u73af\u5883\u4e0b3D\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAutoHet\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u5bf9\u79f03D\u5e76\u884c\uff0c\u6709\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0GPU\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f7f\u5f02\u6784GPU\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b33D\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutoHet\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5355\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u62a2\u5360\u63d0\u51fa\u672c\u5730\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u79cdGPU\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cAutoHet\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4Megatron - LM\u548cWhale\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb1.79\u500d\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb4.38\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoHet\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f02\u6784GPU\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy.

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process.

Examples of such functions include Leontief, Cobb-Douglas, and linear production functions. Nevertheless, the conventional form of the CES production specification is still restrictive in multiple aspects. One example is the fact that the marginal effect of increasing input use always has to be to increase the variability of output quantity by the conventional construction of this function. This paper proposes a generalized variant of the CES production function that allows for various input effects on the probability distribution of output. Failure to allow for this possible input-output risk structure is indeed one of the limitations of the conventional form of the CES production function. This limitation may result in false inferences about input-driven output risk. In light of this, the present paper proposes a solution to this problem. First, it is shown that the familiar CES formulation suffers from very restrictive structural assumptions regarding risk considerations, and that such restrictions may lead to biased and inefficient estimates of production quantity and production risk. Following the general theme of Just and Pope's approach, a CES-based production-function specification that overcomes this shortcoming of the original CES production function is introduced, and a three-stage Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) estimation procedure for the estimation of the proposed functional form is presented. To illustrate the proposed approaches in this paper, two empirical applications in irrigation and fertilizer response using the famous Hexem-Heady experimental dataset are provided.

Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a5\u89e6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u65f6\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u9009\u62e9\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a5\u89e6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BigCodeBench (Hard)\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e94\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u9650\u5236\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u66b4\u9732\u4ec5\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0e\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u534f\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \\emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.

One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks.\n  We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k.

This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation.

This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance.

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings.

This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdPoisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u75ab\u60c5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u96f6\u75c5\u4f8b\u5730\u533a\u75ab\u60c5\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPoisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP)\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e30\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u5730\u533a\u501f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f8\u5bf9\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u96f6\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5982alpha\u548cbeta\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u75ab\u60c5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.\n  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u6cd5Mesh - Attention\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684Ring - Attention\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMesh - Attention\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e2aGPU\u5206\u914d\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u8c03\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "Mesh - Attention\u5728256\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad83.4\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u5e73\u57472.9\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1185.4%\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff08\u5e73\u574779.0%\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "Mesh - Attention\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple language models (GPT-2 variants, GPT-2 Medium, GPT-2 Large) and cross-domain validation (healthcare, finance, legal), we demonstrate that microprobe achieves 23.5% higher composite reliability scores compared to random sampling baselines, with exceptional statistical significance (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.21). Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage.

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u6d45\u4e0e\u6df1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ec5\u505c\u7559\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6d45\u4e0e\u6df1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe86.2 - 90.6%\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad83.3 - 7.1%\u7684\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks.

Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently.

Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks.

However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSHRP\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5904\u7406Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u53c2\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSHRP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Expert Attention\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00Top - 1\u4f7f\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cSHRP\u8fbe\u5230\u539f\u6a21\u578b93%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u53c248%\uff1b\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630184%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474.2\u500d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u81f3\u539fFLOPs\u768411.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "SHRP\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684Web\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6c47\u603b\u7684\u5c55\u793a\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u5f52\u56e0\uff08CDA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u6216\u70b9\u51fb\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8425\u9500\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u9650\u5236\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u96be\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "CDA\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff08\u4f7f\u7528PCMCI\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u6e20\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5bf9\u8f6c\u5316\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9RMSE\u4e3a9.50%\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u65f6\u4e3a24.23%\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "CDA\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6e20\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5177\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks.

These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e5\u5fd7\u9a71\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6ReaSeq\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9d\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e5\u5fd7\u9a71\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eID\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u532e\u4e4f\u548c\u5bf9\u65e5\u5fd7\u5916\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u660e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ReaSeq\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u4ea7\u54c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5230\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\u65e5\u5fd7\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9d\u6392\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0cIPV\u548cCTR\u63d0\u5347\u8d856.0%\uff0c\u8ba2\u5355\u63d0\u5347\u8d852.9%\uff0cGMV\u63d0\u5347\u8d852.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7eaf\u65e5\u5fd7\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5ef6\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u5ef6\u7eed\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528token\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u622a\u65ad\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemma - 3 - 4B - IT\u548cLLaMA - 3.1 - 70B - Instruct\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7528Gemma - 3 - 1B - IT\u548cLLaMA - 3.1 - 8B - Instruct\u8fdb\u884c\u5ef6\u7eed\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e38\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation.

Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u540c\u8f74\u5168\u606f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u82b1\u7c89\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eGAN\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u606f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u82b1\u7c89\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3YOLOv8s\u548cMobileNetV3L\uff0c\u6269\u5c55DIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u7528WGAN - SN\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210DIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5149\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4bmAP50\u8fbe91.3%\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738797%\uff1bDIHM\u6570\u636e\u539f\u59cb\u68c0\u6d4bmAP50 8.15%\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738750%\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u540e\u68c0\u6d4bmAP50 13.3%\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738754%\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u81f315.4%\uff0cGAN\u751f\u6210FID\u5206\u657058.246\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5168\u81ea\u52a8DIHM\u517d\u533b\u6210\u50cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.\n  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8c03\u7814\u5feb\u901f\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6838\u5fc3\u7406\u8bba\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5355\u65f6\u9699\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba83 - \u65f6\u9699\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5f53\u524dGasper\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u6613\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u5b89\u5168\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\uff08SSF\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5feb\u901f\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7406\u8bba\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5355\u65f6\u9699\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5927\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u805a\u5408\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8c03\u78143 - \u65f6\u9699\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u73b0\u72b6\u7684\u8c03\u7814\uff0c\u5bf9\u5355\u65f6\u9699\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u74f6\u9888\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "3 - \u65f6\u9699\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u5e73\u8861\u5feb\u901f\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u548c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u7f51\u7edc\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%.

Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation.

As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76844DGS\u6846\u67b6AirGS\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u89c6\u9891\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d28\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u8f93\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u591a\u901a\u90532D\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u81a8\u80c0\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5c064DGS\u4ea4\u4ed8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u7ea7\u522b\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6PSNR\u8d28\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8520%\uff0c\u5e27\u7ea7PSNR\u59cb\u7ec8\u9ad8\u4e8e30\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f6\u500d\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e27\u4f20\u8f93\u5927\u5c0f\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd150%\u3002", "conclusion": "AirGS\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u89c6\u9891\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA 4DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures.

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.\n  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a \"quality function\" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728NASA\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Cox\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff08EPE\uff09\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u79e9\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08CRS\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u516b\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9EPE\u548cCRS\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u5b50\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3Cox\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost.

Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models.

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5355\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757ResNets\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08NFD\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8d8b\u52bf\u53ca\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u51fadepth - muP\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5c42ResNets\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u672a\u89e3\u91ca\u7f29\u653e\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5927\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u89e3\uff0cdepth - muP\u5bf9\u591a\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u5355\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757ResNets\u7684NFD\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "NFD\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8d8b\u52bf\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u68af\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0depth - muP\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5c42ResNets\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5c42ResNets\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence.

To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps.

To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $\u03c0^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{\u03c0^{*-1}(i),k} \\geq M_{\u03c0^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\\in [n-1], k \\in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $\u03c0^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $\u03bb\\mathbf 1\\{S\\times T\\}$ where $S\\subset [n], T\\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods.

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios.

Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design.

This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting.

This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9488\u5bf9\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCVAE\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5408\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u591a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eConditional Variational Autoencoder\uff08CVAE\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5408\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCVAE\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5371\u9669\u8bca\u65ad\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u5904\u7406\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9884\u5206\u7c7b\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5206\u7c7b\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u7b26\u3002"}}

It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems.

Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions.

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power.

This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation.

Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process.

However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u542b40\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd512\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u57281.3% - 71.4%\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u786e\u4fddAI\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u542b40\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5bf912\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "12\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u57281.3% - 71.4%\uff0c9\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u572830% - 50%\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728AI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks.

We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies.

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RLVR\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e8e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9RLVR\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u8f74\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RLVR\u6216SFT\u5fae\u8c03Qwen - 2.5 - Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4SFT\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u8de8\u7ea7\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1bRLVR\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347LLM\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4ec5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u663e\u73b0\u3002"}}

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization.

This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization).

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology.

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528LLM\u4eba\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f5c\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e8c\u8005\u7b49\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u6307\u51fa\u4f7f\u4eba\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u540c\u6837\u6709\u7528\u662f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u957f\u5236\u7ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\uff0cLLM\u4eba\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u80fd\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u89c2\u5bdf\u603b\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u65f6\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528\u4eba\u7269\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u89d2\u5ea6\u770b\u53ea\u662f\u6837\u672c\u9762\u677f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u4eba\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u76f8\u540c\u662f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6240\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u4eba\u7269\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u4eba\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \\texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections.

Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent.

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness.

Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\\times$ speedups and $3\\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality.

Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings.

Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIPIM\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfSDF\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e14\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aInspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM)\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u539f\u59cb\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IPIM\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1170\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "IPIM\u8ba9\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfSDF\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u5728\u513f\u7ae5 - \u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89e3\u51b3\u534f\u8c03\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u8ba9\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u4f5c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u95f4\u63a5\u4e92\u60e0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u513f\u7ae5 - \u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u513f\u7ae5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFEIBN\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3IBN\u5728IIoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1SSAFL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "IBN\u5728IIoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u56de\u6eda\u96be\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFEIBN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528LLMs\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1SSAFL\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSSAFL\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6bd4SemiAsyn\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c27.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "FEIBN\u6846\u67b6\u548cSSAFL\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86IBN\u5728IIoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation.

We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory.

The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance.

We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization.

Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6cdb\u51fd\u4e0a\u7684\u79ef\u5206 - \u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u878d\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wetterich\u548cWilson - Polchinski\u7b49\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u52bf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u573a\u6784\u578b\u5982\u77ac\u5b50\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \\textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking.

These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5GLiBRL\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316ELBO\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GLiBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728MetaWorld ML10/45\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGLiBRL\u5c06VariBAD\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe2.7\u500d\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GLiBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u8f6e\u7ade\u8d5b\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u7ec4\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6392\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u8f6e\u7ade\u8d5b\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u671f\u83b7\u80dc\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "CSD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u3001\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5730\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\u3002", "conclusion": "CSD\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue.

The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations.

We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMiST\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u53ca\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiST\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u542bSMILES/CIF\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u300129\u4ebftoken\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c10\u4ebftoken\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u53473B\u548c7B\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe1.8\u500d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u673a\u53cd\u5e94\u547d\u540d\u548c\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u5316\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u89e3\u9501\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance.

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker.

This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference.

Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u5236GNN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGNN\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30GNN\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695aGNN\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u5236\u7684GNN\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aGNN\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GNN\u5728\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30GNN\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u7684NotSoTiny\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RTL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u3001\u504f\u5411\u7b80\u5355\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e25\u683c\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTiny Tapeout\u793e\u533a\u7684\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u91cd\u590d\u9879\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u5b9a\u671f\u7eb3\u5165\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "result": "NotSoTiny\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NotSoTiny\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications.

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration.

The paper has been accepted by the WACV 2026 workshop", "summary": "This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets.

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification.

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u63a2\u9488\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5c42\u4f4d\u7f6e - \u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f73\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongFact\u3001HealthBench\u548cTriviaQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMLP\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236CoT\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CoT\u5728\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548cRNA\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8f85\u52a9\u201c\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK.

We then train an activity model that receives only a protein identifier and an author-probability vector derived from structure, with no direct access to molecular descriptors.

Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech.

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each.

Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTexAvatars\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8868\u60c5\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f31\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u5143\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684TexAvatars\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CNN\u5728UV\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684Jacobians\u9a71\u52a83D\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u60c5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5934\u90e8\u91cd\u6f14\u7ece\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002"}}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210SINDy\u4e0eTD3\u7684Dyna - Style\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cc\u8f6c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06SINDy\u4e0eTD3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684Dyna - Style\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528SINDy\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u53cc\u8f6c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eSINDy - TD3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks.

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schr\u00f6dinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCELP\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6613\u805a\u7126\u5c40\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCELP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u533a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fb9\u8865\u5168\u548c\u526a\u679d\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCELP\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results.

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6FOSLS\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RBNO\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u4f5c\u540e\u9a8c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53d8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5c0f\u7684\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaFOSLS\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faRBNO\u786e\u4fdd\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u57fa\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PDE\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53d8\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies.

These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6\u62a4\u7406\uff08POC\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb8\u57fa\u7684xVFA\u5e73\u53f0\u8bca\u65ad\u83b1\u59c6\u75c5\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MCDO\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u8bca\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u7eb8\u57fa\u7684xVFA\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u4e22\u5f03\uff08MCDO\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7eb3\u5165\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u60a3\u8005\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ece88.2%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523095.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eMCDO\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97POC\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots).

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.
