They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined.

Reif showed parallel\nintractability of lex-first DFS. In contrast, randomized parallel algorithms\n(and more recently, deterministic quasipolynomial parallel algorithms) are\nknown for constructing a DFS tree in general (di)graphs. However a\ndeterministic parallel algorithm for DFS in general graphs remains an elusive\ngoal. Working towards this, a series of works gave deterministic NC algorithms\nfor DFS in planar graphs and digraphs. We further extend these results to more\ngeneral graph classes, by providing NC algorithms for (di)graphs of bounded\ngenus, and for undirected H-minor-free graphs where H is a fixed graph with at\nmost one crossing. For the case of (di)graphs of bounded tree-width, we further\nimprove the complexity to a Logspace bound.

However, modern\nrecommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due\nto the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are\nnon-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.\nLookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new\nitems based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such\nlimitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further\nimprove recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)\nstruggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features\nin modern recommendation systems.\n  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel\nframework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user\nmodeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the\nunidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these\nsequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact\nwith the item.

Its\nexistence remains elusive -- even for four agents with additive utility\nfunctions, it is unknown whether an EFX allocation always exists.\nUnsurprisingly, restricted settings to delineate tractable and intractable\ncases have been explored. Christadolou, Fiat et al.[EC'23] introduced the\nnotion of EFX-orientation, where the agents form the vertices of a graph and\nthe items correspond to edges, and an agent values only the items that are\nincident to it. The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents\nwhile satisfying the EFX condition.\n  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp\ncomplexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph --\npolynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs\nwith chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic\nlandscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.\n  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent\ncondition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the\nvaluations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals\naway from being bipartite. Moreover, introducing a single non-binary value\nmakes the problem NP-hard even when the graph is only one edge removal away\nfrom being bipartite.

This work presents a novel design optimization\napproach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing\nbeadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a\ngenerative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict\nstructural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model\npushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to\nlow-vibration solutions.

However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item\nmisalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity\nthat is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative\nsignal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct\ndistributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to\nconflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.\n  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables\nDisentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for\ngenerative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position\nembeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling\nexplicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec\nemploys a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding\nlayer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token\nembeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted\nto tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals.

Serving\nthese models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes\nstatic weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime\nmemory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization\nunder dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management\nframework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating\nsystems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,\nwhich decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU\nmemory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory\nMechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory\ninflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)\na Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize\nmemory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under\nstringent SLO constraints.

In this paper, we\nfocus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through\nthe cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.\nSpecifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading\nand resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we\nformulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for\nthe uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the\nunpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By\nconverting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a\nset of small-scale optimization problems.

In this work, we\nconsider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled\nby an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and\nonly the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split\nthe problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination\nstrategies.

Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage\nand retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater\nstorage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during\nretrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate\nthis issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single\nlane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of\nmulti-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to\naddress the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous\nitem configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the\nobjective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel.

Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern\nheterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We\nsystematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural\nfoundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability,\nprogramming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's\nstrengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation\ndemonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with\nnear-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces\ncommunication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and\nusability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited\nby shared memory contention.

We present a unifying framework for systematically\nconstructing natural language \"state\" representations for prompting LLM agents\nin repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken\nan ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact\nof state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability\nbetween studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods\nof state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the\nextent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward\ninformativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes\nrewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,\nthe extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it\nadmits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments\n\\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find\nthat there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language\nstate representation. In particular, we observe that representations which\nprovide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language\nrepresentations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw\npayoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior\nthat more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more\nstable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit\neither large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play\nover time, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u2018\u72b6\u6001\u2019\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u65f6\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u6027\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5bf9\u535a\u5f08\u5386\u53f2\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u63a9\u76d6\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u9650\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u884c\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u4f7f\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5747\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u79bb\u5747\u8861\u6216\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves\npredictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the\ncontext of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of\ngreedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling\n-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.\nWe design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly\nimproves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful\nnumerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as\nlasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to\nprevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show\nvia numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and\ndegrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve\nof the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of\northogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the\nordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic\nweights, thereby enlarging the model search space.

VLMs integrate visual\nmodalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be\nprompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this\ninstability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt\nvariations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to\nprompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via\nReliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built\non three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and\nvision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,\nand (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt\nvariation analysis.

Directly\napplying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at\nspecific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that\ndeviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods\nprimarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites\nand ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data\nfrom geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the\nchanges in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,\nwe can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its\ninversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more\nrealistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve\nthe accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we\npropose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a\nconditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary\nsatellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and\ntopographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5\nreanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional\ninputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source\ncross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between\nreanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates\natmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During\nsampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution\nERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance.

Under review", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve\nlarge language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on\nmath and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to\ngeneral reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL\nreward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and\nGuru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open\nmodels RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by\n7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We\nalso show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their\nbase models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining\ndata.

Although this\napproach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target\nerror, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement\ndiscrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and\ntarget domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement\nshould be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to\nhigh enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).\nMaximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,\nremoving the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to\nestimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2.

However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as\na uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their\nrelevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains\ncritical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce\nSupervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that\ntreats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups\ntokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM\nusing a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard\ncross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging\ntoken groups and guides the model to better handle different group\ndistributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics.

Dataset\nInference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect\ndataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify\nunauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to\nbe absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's\ndistribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in\npractice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address\nthis challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our\napproach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse\nsynthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we\nachieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based\ncompletion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic\ndata, which is realized through post-hoc calibration.

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods.

The advantage of these\nmethods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise\nunattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based\nsolutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from\ndiffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting\nfactors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the\napproximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains\nunclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We\naddress the issue by employing a Schr\\\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between\nthe distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate\nthe learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we\nextend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge\n($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional\nImage-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework. To\nvalidate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the\nreference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the\nobserved seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion\nmodel suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function\nevaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with\nsupervised learning-based approach.

In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs\non the task of multi-document reasoning.

Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,\nmodifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning\nchallenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text\nsurface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We\nanalyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that\nMDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively\nshort document sets.

However, in-home meal\nassistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,\neating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),\nfood items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we\npropose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized\nin-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed\nin collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative\nstudy with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three\nkey tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and\nsafety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that\nenables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)\ndiverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and\nphysical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,\nand (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently\nadapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the\npersonalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating\nthat FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and\noutperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations.

Conclusion: Temporal convolutional\nnetworks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing\nlinear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u68af\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5c0f\u52a8\u7269\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u7ec4\u8bad\u7ec3\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u7528\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u68af\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a\nsimilar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent\nthe homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does\nnot hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in\nreal-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily\nLearning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two\nnovel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph\nnormality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters\nthat capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with\nvarying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node\nattributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise\nand cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned\nby the filters in the two views.

RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal\nimpact, indicating potential memorization.

Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that\nAutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model\nwhen run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted\nrules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets.

Recently,\nsingle-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor\nmeasuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical\ndiagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures\nassociated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections\ncaused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,\nthe limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,\nrequiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.\nIn high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a\nconstrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture\ndetails in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain\nis required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog\nsignal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors\ncollectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic\nimages. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image\nsensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:\nfixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that\nsynergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced\nlearning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors.

We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate\ngland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI\n(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training\nstrategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed\ncohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The\ntest set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation\nendpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR\nachieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,\nwhile UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared\nto the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR\nhad an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in\ncross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR\nachieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for\nReader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;\nReader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed\npoorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention\neffectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in\nimprovements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

Unlike traditional\nAI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the\nchallenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We\nempirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the\nMetropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference\nmechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention\nnaming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,\nalways-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that\nhuman-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization\naccuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared\nsign system.

Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this\nsetting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum\naccuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,\nmulti-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for\nadvancing document understanding research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWikiMixQA\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b1000\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7684WikiMixQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece4000\u7bc7\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u9875\u9762\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea670%\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u957f\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cGPT - 4 - o\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8550%\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u738727%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0cWikiMixQA\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning\n(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,\nlow-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;\nand (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT\ndynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with\ntask-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,\nVQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached\nfeatures, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual\ninputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally\n``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVQ - TTT\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u964d\u7ea7\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVQ - TTT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u79e9\u5185\u6838\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6d45\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u6096\u8bba\uff0cVQ - TTT\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684MLLMs\u548c\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49MLLMs\u7684\u201c\u66f4\u597d\u201d\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u201c\u5e72\u51c0\u201d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics\nframework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid\nrepresentation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency.

Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views.
