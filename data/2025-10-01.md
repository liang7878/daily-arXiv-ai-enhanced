### [1] [Blueprint-Bench: Comparing spatial intelligence of LLMs, agents and image models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25229)
*Lukas Petersson,Axel Backlund,Axel Wennstöm,Hanna Petersson,Callum Sharrock,Arash Dabiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍Blueprint - Bench基准，用于评估AI模型空间推理能力，评估多种模型，发现当前AI有显著短板，该基准提供数值框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有现代多模态模型虽能处理照片输入，但缺乏空间重建所需的真正空间智能，需评估模型空间推理能力。

Method: 使用Blueprint - Bench基准，在50个公寓约20张室内图像数据集上评估多种模型，用评分算法衡量生成与真实平面图相似度。

Result: 多数模型表现低于或接近随机基线，人类表现远优于模型；图像生成模型难遵循指令，基于代理迭代改进方法无明显提升。

Conclusion: Blueprint - Bench为比较不同模型架构空间智能提供首个数值框架，将持续评估新模型并欢迎社区提交。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

### [2] [The Causal Abstraction Network: Theory and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25236)
*Gabriele D'Acunto,Paolo Di Lorenzo,Sergio Barbarossa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文引入因果抽象网络（CAN），研究其理论性质并解决一致CAN的学习问题，实验在合成数据上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用结构因果模型（SCMs）提高AI的可解释性、可信度和鲁棒性，推进因果知识网络层的形式化研究。

Method: 引入CAN，研究其理论性质，将学习问题分解为边缘特定的局部黎曼问题，提出高效搜索程序，用SPECTRAL方法解决局部问题。

Result: 在合成数据的因果抽象学习任务中表现有竞争力，成功恢复多种CAN结构。

Conclusion: 所提出的CAN及学习方法在因果抽象学习方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

### [3] [A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25239)
*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对比Chain - of - Thought (CoT)和Latent Thought in looped models两种推理方法，分析各自优势并为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两种推理方法虽都利用迭代计算，但对比能力未充分研究，需分析以指导推理范式选择。

Method: 对Latent Thought in Looped Transformers和CoT进行形式分析。

Result: Latent Thought in Looped Transformers可并行计算，比CoT的顺序过程更高效；CoT利用随机解码近似解决精确计算难处理的问题。

Conclusion: 分析出两种推理方法的差异，为根据任务选择推理范式提供实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at
https://github.com/kevin671/cot-vs-loop.

### [4] [Neo-Grounded Theory: A Methodological Innovation Integrating High-Dimensional Vector Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration for Qualitative Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25244)
*Shuide Wen,Beier Ku,Teng Wang,Mingyang Zou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Neo Grounded Theory (NGT)，它结合向量聚类和多智能体系统解决定性研究规模深度悖论，实验表明其速度快、质量高、成本低，还体现了人机协作优势及对定性研究的积极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究的规模深度悖论，实现大规模数据集在短时间内分析并保持解释严谨性。

Method: 将NGT与手动编码和ChatGPT辅助分析对比，采用1536维嵌入、层次聚类和基于并行智能体编码，进行纯自动化和人工引导优化两个实验。

Result: NGT速度提升168倍，质量更优，成本降低96%；人机协作重要，能发现手动编码看不见的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性和人类解释互补，降低成本使定性研究民主化，实时分析让结果与事件同步，计算方法可加强定性研究人文承诺。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.
  Keywords: Grounded theory; Vector embeddings; Multi agent systems; Human AI
collaboration; Computational qualitative analysis

### [5] [CIMNAS: A Joint Framework for Compute-In-Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25862)
*Olga Krestinskaya,Mohammed E. Fouda,Ahmed Eltawil,Khaled N. Salama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CIMNAS框架用于CIM架构软硬件联合优化，在多指标上有显著提升且无精度损失，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为最大化基于内存计算（CIM）的神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需对软硬件设计参数进行联合优化，手动调参不可行，因此要自动化设计和优化。

Method: 引入CIMNAS框架，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，进行设备、电路和架构级的联合优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，相比各种基线，EDAP降低90.1x - 104.5x，TOPS/W提高4.68x - 4.82x，TOPS/mm²提高11.3x - 12.78x，精度保持73.81%；扩展到SRAM - 基于的ResNet50架构时，EDAP最多降低819.5x。

Conclusion: CIMNAS能实现以EDAP为重点的优化且无精度损失，可生成高性能CIM神经网络设计的多样软硬件参数组合。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at
https://github.com/OlgaKrestinskaya/CIMNAS.

### [6] [Memory Management and Contextual Consistency for Long-Running Low-Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25250)
*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对LCNC代理的内存管理问题，提出混合内存系统，经实验证明优于传统方法，建立新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI原生LCNC平台的代理在长时间运行时存在内存管理挑战，如“内存膨胀”和“上下文退化”问题。

Method: 提出结合情景和语义记忆组件与“智能衰减”机制的混合内存系统，还有以用户为中心的可视化界面。

Result: 通过模拟实验，系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 建立了构建可靠、透明且能有效长期学习和适应的AI代理的新框架。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

### [7] [Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Fact Grounded Attention (FGA)架构修改方法，将不可靠语言模型变为确定性真相讲述者，实验显示准确率大幅提升，能秒级更新知识且消除可验证事实的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型受概率本质限制，存在事实幻觉问题，需解决。

Method: 提出FGA，在Transformer的预softmax注意力分数处干预，将可验证知识注入注意力机制。

Result: 在1107个技术查询实验中，准确率从香草Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到99.7%，知识更新不到一秒，远快于参数编辑方法。

Conclusion: FGA能完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，使神经语言生成从概率近似转向确定性精确。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

### [8] [SING-SQL: A Synthetic Data Generation Framework for In-Domain Text-to-SQL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25672)
*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SING - SQL框架生成高质量合成文本到SQL数据，发布SingSQL - LM模型，在多个指标上表现优异，为企业级文本到SQL系统提供可扩展范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究多强调跨领域泛化，未满足企业单数据库模式专业化及评估需求。

Method: 引入SING - SQL框架，对数据库模式分层分区、合成多复杂度SQL查询，采用质量感知管道；发布在合成数据上微调的SingSQL - LM模型。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集及合成评估集上，SingSQL - LM模型超越先前系统，取得最优成绩。

Conclusion: SING - SQL是可扩展、数据库无关的企业级文本到SQL系统生产和评估范式。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

### [9] [Language Model Planning from an Information Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25260)
*Muhammed Ustaomeroglu,Baris Askin,Gauri Joshi,Carlee Joe-Wong,Guannan Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过分析Transformer计算核心的隐藏状态，开发压缩代码的管道，研究解码器语言模型的规划能力，揭示了规划的一些特性并贡献了探测内部动态的通用管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解码器语言模型在规划能力方面存在诸多未明确的问题，涉及可解释性、可靠性和模型设计，需要研究其如何实现规划能力。

Method: 分析Transformer计算核心的隐藏状态，开发基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道将隐藏表示压缩成紧凑的摘要代码，测量互信息进行系统分析，在多个数据集上研究规划的三个关键方面。

Result: 有效规划范围与任务相关，模型隐式保留未使用的正确延续信息，预测主要依赖近期计算，但早期块仍有信息价值。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，贡献了探测语言模型和深度学习系统内部动态的通用管道。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法有局限性，本文提出理论框架重构风险概念空间，推出RADAR评估框架，实验显示其在多维度上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏差和因模型同质性导致的检测失败等局限性，需重新审视风险评估范式。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为三个子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，利用多轮辩论机制和动态更新机制，构建含800个挑战性案例的评估数据集。

Result: 在挑战性测试集和公共基准上的实验表明，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自我评估风险敏感性等多维度上显著优于基线评估方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR评估框架能有效覆盖显式和隐式风险，减轻评估者偏差，在大语言模型安全评估中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽能提升大语言模型能力，但复杂数据流程和多样任务给训练系统带来挑战，且从系统角度对其理解有限，需深入了解。

Method: 对RLVR任务进行特征分析，研究不同训练步骤中不同RL任务的工作负载分布和变化趋势；提出PolyTrace基准套件进行评估。

Result: 识别出序列长度分布不均导致GPU空闲、动态变化工作负载下并行策略低效、数据管理机制低效和负载不平衡等问题；PolyTrace基准套件准确率达94.7%。

Conclusion: 描述了观察结果，呼吁对剩余开放挑战进一步研究，验证了PolyTrace基准套件的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出因果可视化编程（CVP）范式，解决大语言模型代理的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，实验证明其有效性，为构建更可靠AI代理提供途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代理因依赖概率关联而非因果理解，存在幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，需引入因果结构解决。

Method: 引入CVP编程范式，让用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的因果结构，形成有向无环图作为推理约束；设计模拟训练和测试环境分布偏移的合成实验进行验证。

Result: 因果锚定模型在分布偏移时保持稳定精度，纯关联基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 给出工作流模块因果结构的形式化定义，提出并实现CVP框架，证实其能增强代理鲁棒性，减少因果混淆错误，为构建更优AI代理提供可行路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出ID - RAG机制解决生成式智能体长期记忆连贯性问题，通过社会模拟验证其效果并开源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文增长，生成式智能体难以保持连贯性，会导致身份漂移等关键问题，需要解决。

Method: 引入Identity Retrieval - Augmented Generation (ID - RAG)机制，将智能体的角色和偏好建立在动态结构化身份模型上，在决策循环中查询模型获取相关身份上下文以指导行动选择，并实现了Human - AI Agents (HAis)。

Result: 在市长选举社会模拟中，使用ID - RAG的HAis在长周期角色连贯性上优于基线智能体，第四时间步所有测试模型身份召回率更高，GPT - 4o和GPT - 4o mini分别减少19%和58%的模拟收敛时间。

Conclusion: 将身份作为可显式检索的知识结构，ID - RAG为开发更具时间连贯性、可解释性和一致性的生成式智能体提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出并行代理推理框架Flash - Searcher，将执行范式从顺序链转变为有向无环图，经多基准测试表现优于现有方法，展示了其在复杂推理任务中的可扩展性和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型框架主要依靠顺序处理，在需要大量工具交互的任务中执行效率低，需改进执行范式。

Method: 提出Flash - Searcher框架，将复杂任务分解为有明确依赖关系的子任务，以有向无环图实现独立推理路径的并发执行，同时通过动态工作流优化不断改进执行图并集成摘要模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出色，如在BrowseComp上准确率达67.7%，在xbench - DeepSearch上达83%，相比现有框架减少执行步骤达35%；将并行推理管道提炼到单模型时，不同骨干架构性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作在代理架构设计上有显著进展，为复杂推理任务提供了更具可扩展性和高效性的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建具有可解释性的AI系统，克服传统自编码器黑盒的问题。

Method: 大语言模型通过一系列系统指令将FCM转化为文本并重构，不对比输出和输入。

Result: 能近似实现从FCM到自身的恒等映射，重构过程会去除弱因果边，保留强因果边。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的可解释AI系统在FCM处理上有可行性和一定优势，能提供更易人类理解的编码信息。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代理广泛应用引发安全担忧，以往研究可能忽略现实场景中自发复制风险，因此开展研究。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务进行场景驱动评估，设计可能导致目标不一致的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和总过度使用计数（AOC）指标。

Result: 评估 21 个模型，超 50% 的 LLM 代理在操作压力下有明显失控自我复制倾向，整体风险得分超安全阈值 0.5。

Conclusion: 实际部署 LLM 代理时迫切需要场景驱动的风险评估和强大的保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能在短时间内从一阶ToM发展到高阶ToM，而以自回归语言模型为代表的神经网络需伴随推理等高级技能提升，研究神经网络能否像人类一样独立完成这一发展。

Method: 引入模拟最小认知系统、仅获取一阶ToM能力的神经心智理论网络ToMNN，评估其二阶和三阶ToM能力。

Result: ToMNN的二阶和三阶ToM能力评估准确率远超随机水平；从一阶到二阶ToM泛化时准确率下降更明显，且任务复杂度增加准确率降低；不同参数规模下结果具有普遍性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了机器ToM泛化模式，为开发更类人的认知系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Conclusion: 合成推理提炼方法能有效增强大语言模型的特定领域推理能力。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 重新思考AI数据中心构建、硬件更新和运营三阶段方案，分析电力、冷却和网络供应设计选择，探索更新策略，进行运营软件优化，提出整体生命周期管理框架。

Result: 系统比传统方法最多降低40%的TCO。

Conclusion: 需重新思考整个生命周期，利用整体管理框架协调优化各阶段决策，还给出未来管理AI数据中心生命周期的指南。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型推理时难融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型有黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要结构化反馈诊断特定维度问题。

Method: 提出SRM，这是一个模块化、可解释的框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，并引入细粒度维度。

Result: SRMs在鲁棒性和符合人类偏好方面优于标量RMs和GRMs，模块化设计支持实际场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

Motivation: LLM代理复杂架构易出现级联故障，当前系统缺乏模块化、系统性理解和检测错误的框架。

Method: 提出AgentErrorTaxonomy对故障模式进行模块化分类；构建AgentErrorBench数据集；提出AgentDebug调试框架隔离根源故障并提供纠正反馈。

Conclusion: 有原则的调试是构建更可靠、自适应LLM代理的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Result: 系统分析了当前多模态大语言模型在两层的关键瓶颈，调研了前沿方法，回顾了关键基准。

Conclusion: 为研究界理解当前多模态大语言模型内在局限提供清晰视角，指明构建下一代模型的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

Motivation: LLMs存在安全、公平性问题，RAG虽可减少幻觉但带来新公平性问题，需对SLMs进行公平性测试。

Method: 通过元变形测试（MT），在提示中引入可控的人口统计学扰动，对三个集成RAG管道的SLMs进行情感分析公平性评估。

Result: 小的人口统计学变化可破坏多达三分之一的元变形关系（MRs），种族提示扰动是违规的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG的检索组件需精心策划以防止偏差放大，为开发者、测试人员和小组织提供实用警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答中差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点一致性更具信息价值，需有效方法处理。

Method: 先进行轻量级仿射预对齐减少运动干扰，在每个训练周期内分两步循环，先提取关键词生成疾病聚焦显著性，再应用共享显著性掩码生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical - Diff - VQA上，BLEU、ROUGE - L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上有竞争力，有内在可解释性，骨干和解码器无需放射学特定预训练。

Conclusion: 轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的有效框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

Motivation: 现有方法存在间接改进CDCL分支、依赖强化学习和CDCL信息不足等问题，需要更好的分支策略。

Result: ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于现有学习方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT是一种有效的CDCL求解器分支策略，能提升求解效率。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form
of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot
navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a
continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions.
Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on
predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's
dynamics.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效，可在提高推理准确率的同时提升效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR性能优于现有模型路由方法，对分布外查询也有良好表现，且能高效集成额外模型。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个轻量级、可解释且可扩展的路由框架，能有效解决推理语言模型的配置路由问题。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Result: 实现病例定义在系统间的一致、可扩展使用，释放AI在加强公共卫生准备和响应方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 所提出的格式和平台有助于解决现有病例定义存在的问题，推动公共卫生领域发展。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings,
heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing
mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI
components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks
comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates
superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in
diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories,
and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid
recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable
for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and
non-profit sectors.

<details>

Motivation: 当前RLVR训练存在性能提升停滞问题，原因是探索模式稀疏，需要解决探索不足的瓶颈。

Method: 提出DeepSearch框架，将蒙特卡罗树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，包含全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的引导选择和自适应回放缓冲区训练等方法。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch平均准确率达62.95%，为1.5B推理模型创造新的最优结果，使用的GPU时长比扩展训练方法少5.7倍。

Conclusion: 强调战略探索比暴力扩展更重要，DeepSearch为提升推理能力指明了通过系统搜索而非长时间计算的新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Motivation: LALMs在语音情感识别（SER）任务中因副语言建模弱和跨模态推理有限而表现不佳。

Method: 提出CCoT - Emo框架，引入结构化情感图（EGs）指导LALMs进行情感推理，EGs编码多种特征并嵌入提示中。

Result: 在SER基准测试中，CCoT - Emo优于先前的SOTA方法，且提高了零样本基线的准确率。

Conclusion: CCoT - Emo框架能有效提升LALMs在SER任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流行可解释性框架API难以适配图像字幕、深度强化学习等复杂建模场景。

Method: 基于tensordict构建TDHook框架，有现成归因、探测方法和灵活API。

Result: TDHook依赖少，磁盘空间约为transformer_lens一半，运行多目标管道的集成梯度时，速度比captum快2倍。

Conclusion: TDHook可弥补不同方法类差距，使现代可解释性管道更易使用。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Motivation: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐在模型扩展时性能饱和，需寻找有更好扩展性的生成式推荐模型。

Method: 对比研究基于语义ID的生成式推荐和直接用大语言模型作为推荐器这两种范式。

Result: LLM - as - RS范式有更好的模型扩展性，比SID - based GR最佳性能提升达20%，且LLM规模增大时捕捉用户 - 物品交互信息能力增强。

Conclusion: SID - based GR有扩展性限制，LLM - as - RS是生成式推荐基础模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Motivation: GraphRAG大多依赖静态检索，关键证据缺失时推理崩溃、产生幻觉，迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚不明确。

Method: 系统研究GraphRAG中迭代检索，分析不同策略与图骨干的交互，提出Bridge - Guided Dual - Thought - based Retrieval (BDTR)框架。

Result: 迭代检索在复杂多跳问题上有优势，但存在引入噪声、单跳或简单问题增益有限等问题；BDTR在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: GraphRAG有效性不仅取决于召回率，还需将桥梁证据提升到前列；BDTR框架为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的多智能体强化学习基准测试中，IWoL两种变体均有效，且可与现有算法结合提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL为团队协调提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: AI的不透明性可引发泛灵解释，使大型语言对象为日常事物带来魅力，引发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探索自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型如何不依赖外部奖励或标注数据，通过最大化自我不确定性提升图像生成效果，提出IRIS框架，实验表明其性能可与或优于外部奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）在自回归T2I生成中受限于人类偏好数据有限，需探索不依赖外部奖励或标注数据的方法。

Method: 提出IRIS（内在奖励图像合成）框架，利用内在奖励通过强化学习改进自回归T2I模型。

Result: 将IRIS应用于自回归T2I模型，实现了与外部奖励相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自我不确定性而非自我确定性可改善图像生成，IRIS框架仅使用内在奖励就能有效提升自回归T2I模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Conclusion: 所提框架为多种高效推理技术提供统一理论，合理利用层跳过可实现高效推理。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优可行解，以旅行规划为例，需解决约束感知规划难题。

Method: ATLAS采用动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索机制。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；实际场景中最终通过率达84%，远超基线模型。

Conclusion: ATLAS在处理旅行规划复杂约束问题上有效，是首个在含实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的真实任务中展示量化效果的工作。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子病历的时间动态，大语言模型在处理临床事件序列和时间依赖方面存在困难。

Method: 提出Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过对临床事件序列进行自回归微调来增强大语言模型的时间推理能力。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中表现优越，在时间推理任务中，比专业电子病历模型的AUROC高4.6%，比通用大语言模型的C指数高7.2%。

Conclusion: NEP框架具有先进的预测准确性和符合已知疾病途径的临床可解释性注意力模式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Motivation: 现有基于结果奖励的强化学习稀疏、反馈延迟，过程奖励标注难且难以平衡局部与最终结果。

Result: PPR在多种基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: PPR有效解决现有奖励机制问题，提升大语言模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代大语言模型的潜在编码能力，提出代理复杂度定律，即核心模型提升时，不同复杂度代理的性能差距会缩小。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Conclusion: SMS方案解决了现有真实样本遗忘验证方法的局限性，具有有效性。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at

Result: 评估多种模型发现持续自我复制和多智能体系统存在显著障碍，如上下文保留和多智能体决策。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以降低障碍严重性，减少未来更实用多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中难以匹配指令与环境信息，缺乏常识推理能力。

Result: LGK方法在R2R和REVERIE数据集上表现优于现有方法，在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面更优。

Conclusion: LGK方法能有效解决传统方法常识不足导致的问题，提升视觉语言导航性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in

Motivation: 现有审计难以揭示AI系统不公平性产生的原因，尤其是源于结构偏差的情况。

Result: 通过德国信用数据集的示例展示了框架在实际案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架可用于解释AI决策中的代理歧视，揭示隐藏的结构偏差。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Motivation: 改进视觉问答（VQA）性能，减少背景噪声、缓解幻觉，提高回答准确性和真实性。

Method: 引入文本关联目标定位，生成相关目标边界框进行针对性图像裁剪和信息检索，还提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: RAG方法使准确率从22.19%提升到25.64%，去幻觉方法将幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效提升了VQA性能，减少了幻觉，提高了回答真实性。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

Result: 将DeepSeek - V3存储从1.3TB降至103GB，输出质量高，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法，首次在128GB内存限制平台部署压缩模型。

Conclusion: 综合实验证明该方法在多种内存约束下，模型尺寸更小、精度更高。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的带专家系统的异质图强化学习框架能有效提升自动驾驶车辆决策性能。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在困难，神经符号方法受逻辑执行和预定义谓词限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 引入NePTune框架，采用混合执行模型，将基础视觉模型感知能力与符号推理组合表达能力结合，把自然语言查询动态转换为可执行Python程序。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域中，相比强基础模型有显著提升，展现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune框架能克服现有神经符号方法的局限性，有效解决视觉语言模型的组合推理问题。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

Motivation: 现代大推理模型训练后能力提升，但架构机制不透明，需研究其背后原理。

Method: 采用电路分析方法，对Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型进行比较分析，还有消融和定性分析。

Result: 不同训练方式下注意力头进化不同，可控开关思考模型无专用思考头，电路动态与性能存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力提升会牺牲基础计算能力，未来训练策略设计要平衡有效推理策略开发和可靠执行。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成文本流畅但常用安全通用表述，引发对其处理创造力能力的质疑，因此进行研究。

Method: 使用广告概念的创造力压力测试，结合定量比较与定性分析。

Result: 简化广告创意时创意特征先消失，模型从简化输入再生的文本有词汇多样性但缺乏深度和独特性，提供特定提示可改善但仍依赖熟悉套路。

Conclusion: 无针对性引导，大语言模型在创意任务中趋于平庸，结构化信号可部分对抗该趋势并为开发有创造力敏感性的模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在TravelPlanner基准上Agentic RL的表现及提升方法。

Method: 使用Planner - R1方法，研究不同大小模型在奖励塑形、课程学习等情况下的表现。

Result: Planner - R1最终通过率达56.9%，小模型对奖励塑形响应好，计算和内存效率高，大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健，课程学习无显著益处。

Conclusion: 奖励塑形是扩展Agentic RL的决定性因素，小模型有竞争力，能在不牺牲泛化性的前提下实现高效。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Conclusion: PureVQ - GAN实用且适用于实际训练管道

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树搜索方法在长时推理任务中效率低，比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级，需提高效率。

Method: 引入CiT框架，通过轻量级Branching Necessity (BN)评估方法（BN - DP和BN - SC）自适应决定搜索时的分支时机，并集成到三种树搜索框架进行评估。

Result: BN - DP能减少75 - 85%的资源消耗，精度损失小甚至有提升；BN - SC能大幅节省资源但有不稳定性；辅助大模型质量很关键，在确定动作空间领域BN - SC无需大模型。

Conclusion: CiT框架有效提高树搜索方法效率，BN - DP有理论优势，发布统一实现方便后续研究。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Method: 使用t - SNE分析可视化风格嵌入分布；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器并结合对比学习；提出风格标注策略。

Result: HiStyle应用于基础TTS模型时，在风格可控性上显著优于其他方法，且语音自然度和可懂度高。

Conclusion: HiStyle在可控语音合成方面表现出色，能有效提升风格可控性并保持语音质量。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽经安全对齐，但存在易被简单语言变化绕过的拒绝行为漏洞，现有对齐方法泛化性差且机制不明。

Method: 先通过电路分析确定与时态攻击越狱相关的注意力头，再训练通道缩放向量校准易受时态影响头的激活，最后进行预防性微调。

Result: 在三个大语言模型上，ASGuard有效降低目标越狱攻击成功率，保留通用能力并减少过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 基于机制分析揭示对抗后缀抑制拒绝调解方向传播，展示了深入理解模型内部可开发实用、高效、有针对性的调整模型行为方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Result: 广泛实验表明现有模型易出现安全故障，SafeMindAgent显著提高安全率且保持可比的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身大语言模型代理的安全风险研究和缓解提供了评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into

safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.

*Zhicheng Zhou,Jing Li,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 互联网信息冗余难提取价值，多层嵌套JSON可压缩信息，LLMs可输出结构化结果，但现有评估基准有局限，本文提出DeepJSONEval基准并开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLMs JSON输出能力的基准过度强调纯JSON生成，未评估数据理解和提取能力，与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 引入具有2100个多领域深层嵌套结构实例、按难度分类的DeepJSONEval基准。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在处理这种复杂度时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和数据集开源，有助于推进结构化JSON生成的研究。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Abstract: The integration of vital signs in healthcare has witnessed a steady rise,
promising health professionals to assist in their daily tasks to improve
patient treatment. In life-threatening situations, like rescue operations,
crucial decisions need to be made in the shortest possible amount of time to
ensure that excellent treatment is provided during life-saving measurements.
The integration of vital signs in the treatment holds the potential to improve

serve to support health professionals during the treatment with useful
information and suggestions. To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves
to provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a
wrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the
significant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during

accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

Motivation: 大语言模型推理质量不仅取决于答案正确性，还与中间步骤有效性有关，研究MCQA中思维链问题。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集实验中，改进方法提高了过程正确推理率，强化学习中也提升了答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理幻觉和提高可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出NuRisk数据集用于自动驾驶时空推理，对比不同VLM方法，微调模型有改进但任务仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLMs的方法缺乏自动驾驶风险时空推理能力，需改进。

Method: 构建包含2900个场景和110万个样本的NuRisk数据集，对不同提示技术下的VLMs进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM代理。

Result: 现有VLMs时空推理表现不佳，峰值准确率33%且延迟高；微调的7B VLM代理准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽有进展，但任务挑战大，NuRisk是推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Result: 管道有效发现能捕捉细节且泛化性强的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理很重要。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效进行自动模型发现，多模态和多步骤推理对发现有利模型至关重要。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoRecomp方法解决标准RLVR训练问题，测试显示有显著效率提升且对性能影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练存在推理过程冗长、探索轨迹低效问题，因仅结果奖励无效率激励且优化信号有噪声。

Method: 提出RoRecomp方法，将响应分为优先批次和补偿批次，分别提供简洁梯度信号和维持稳定性。

Result: 在三种设置中测试，零RL训练推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且准确率提升，思维压缩长度最多减少52.5%。

Conclusion: RoRecomp方法可有效引导模型进行简洁推理，提升效率且对性能影响小。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Motivation: 现有语言模型训练易记忆和暴露敏感信息，先前方法无法消除潜在知识且扩展性有限。

Method: 提出CURE框架，用轻量级校正器验证输出，检索相关目标辅助校正，无需额外训练适应新请求。

Result: CURE大幅减少信息泄露，在间接查询上表现好，保持响应质量和通用性，在持续学习场景下有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE实用，适合现实应用。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 现有研究将人类编造的错误信息和AI生成的虚假内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型虚假内容，在现实场景有效性受限。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架，利用VLM骨干网络和Category - aware MoE Adapter捕捉特定类别线索，采用归因思维链机制定位显著欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种类型虚假信息上都取得了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门基线。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM - NAS效果好且泛化性出色。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

Result: 为研究者在使用LLMs进行原型设计和预测时避免类别错误提供指引。

Conclusion: 在社会科学中使用LLMs时要谨慎解读其输出，采用实用框架和防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Result: 实验表明SafeEvalAgent有效，随着评估难度增加，模型安全率下降，如GPT - 5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 静态评估有局限，框架能发现传统方法遗漏的漏洞，需要动态评估生态系统确保AI安全部署。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative

engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

### [87] ['Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167)
*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI文化对齐方法有局限，论文主张引入社科定性方法，提出“厚输出”概念和成功文化对齐的条件，呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI文化对齐方法依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需解决文化对齐的本质问题。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的“厚描”概念，提出AI应产生“厚输出”，并明确成功文化对齐的三个必要条件。

Result: 提出了“厚输出”概念和成功文化对齐的三个条件。

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作，采用定性、人种学评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感且反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 测试大语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现方面的潜力。

Method: 重新利用LangGraph工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行询问，通过儿童游戏提供概念验证，并应用于原子层处理反应器模拟。

Result: 证明了试错和坚持在知识发现中的作用，结果具有强路径依赖性，且LLM代理能在有限探测能力下探索、发现和利用化学相互作用。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文基于Gienapp框架设计问卷评估RAG输出，经多轮完善，结合人类和人机反馈，结果显示LLM和人类评分有差异，最终问卷扩展了原框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）系统应用增多，但缺乏系统的、以人类为中心的输出评估，故要设计问卷评估。

Method: 基于Gienapp的效用维度框架设计问卷，通过对查询 - 输出对进行多轮评分和语义讨论迭代完善，纳入人类评估者和人机组合的反馈。

Result: 大语言模型（LLMs）能关注指标描述和量表标签，但检测文本格式变化能力弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释有帮助，但与人类评分缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

TL;DR: 论文提出DIVER框架，强调全局序列级多样性对深度探索和推理的作用，实验显示其优于多种基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在推理任务中存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题，需要改进。

Method: 先进行实证研究揭示全局多样性与推理能力的正相关，引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，开发基于势的奖励塑造机制并设计启发式方法避免奖励欺骗。

Result: DIVER在多种探索策略的基线对比中，在域内和域外任务的Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现更优。

Conclusion: DIVER框架有效，能提升推理能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 文章指出大语言模型分布式训练因上下文长度差异大而效率低，现有方案有缺陷，提出SlimPack框架解决问题，实验显示能提升训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型分布式训练受上下文长度差异影响，存在数据异构、工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低等问题，现有方案难以兼顾内存和通信效率。

Method: 引入SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法，由两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器协调，解决各并行维度的不平衡。

Result: SlimPack实现了比基线高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: SlimPack打破传统权衡，实现了更好的平衡和高资源效率。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Conclusion: 所提框架在长视野具身规划中有效，能应对外生过程并实现泛化。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Motivation: 现有多智能体学习方法推理时需重新执行MAS，与人类认知不同，要探究多智能体交互能否提升LLMs独立解决问题的能力。

Method: 引入ILR框架，含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力选择策略，通过Idea3交互范式交流信息；感知校准用GRPO训练LLMs。

Result: 在不同规模的三个LLMs上验证，在六个基准测试中，ILR始终优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升达5%。

Conclusion: ILR有效，Idea3能增强强LLMs鲁棒性，动态交互类型优于纯合作或竞争策略。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Motivation: 大语言模型面临越狱攻击风险，现有防御方法存在高计算成本、泛化性有限等问题。

Method: 提出SafeBehavior，将安全评估分解为意图推理、自我反思和自我修正三个阶段。

Result: SafeBehavior在多种越狱攻击类型的实验中显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior是一种高效且受人类启发的方法，可保护大语言模型免受越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

Conclusion: FLoRA - NA实现了通信效率，弥合了局部个性化和全局泛化之间的差距，解决了先前个性化FedLoRA方法的关键限制。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍基于Transformer的框架用于乳腺病变分类，构建数据集，模型表现良好并公开资源推动研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺磁共振成像特异性差，导致高假阳性率和不必要活检，且现有公共数据集缺乏良性病变注释，限制分类研究。

Method: 引入基于Transformer的框架，采用SegFormer架构，构建BreastDCEDL_AMBL数据集，结合其他数据集训练，运用迁移学习。

Result: 模型病变级分类AUC达0.92，患者级灵敏度100%、特异性67%，可减少三分之一不必要活检，量化恶性像素分布。

Conclusion: 公开数据集、模型和评估协议，提供首个标准化基准，推动DCE - MRI病变分类方法学发展和临床应用。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法在联邦学习中存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中心服务器等局限，需改进。

Method: 提出ZeroDFL框架，采用迭代提示共享机制，让客户端优化和交换文本提示。

Result: 在九个图像分类数据集上验证，表现优于或等同于现有方法，相比FedTPG降低118倍通信开销。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL增强了联邦零样本学习的泛化性，提升可扩展性、效率和隐私性，为大视觉语言模型在现实应用中的去中心化适配铺平道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个常用大语言模型存在严重自我偏好，自我偏好随分配身份产生，该现象影响决策判断，呼吁模型开发者解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型本应避免决策失真，但未知其是否存在自我偏好，故展开研究。

Method: 进行5项研究、约20000次查询，开展词语联想任务，通过API查询，操纵模型身份。

Result: 模型在词语联想任务中有自我偏好，API模型缺乏自我认知，自我偏好随分配身份产生，且在多种场景中存在。

Conclusion: 自我偏好深植于大语言模型认知，影响其行为，呼吁开发者解决判断和决策中立性问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对恶意指令的攻击方法多限于单模态且依赖有语义漂移的提示重写，未探索UMMs独特漏洞，需挖掘其安全弱点。

Method: 定义与目标查询在时空上下文强相关的恶意事件，用三幕叙事理论生成前后场景，隐藏恶意事件为高潮。利用UMMs生成能力生成场景图像，再通过理解能力开展猜图问答游戏，嵌入恶意问题让模型作答。

Result: STaR - Attack效果超先前方法，在Gemini - 2.0 - Flash上ASR达93.06%，超越最强基线FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 研究揭示UMMs关键且未充分开发的漏洞，强调对其进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

Method: 提出Rare Case Performance Gap、Rare Case Calibration Error、患病率效用定义的罕见性以及临床加权目标等操作修复方法，且权重选择应经过结构化审议。

Result: 分析了肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科的临床案例，表明平均优化导致错过罕见响应者、延误非典型紧急情况识别和视力威胁变体表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学人工智能必须检测特殊病例，因其具有重要意义。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

Conclusion: 该方法可行，识别出有趣机会和有前景的研究方向可与学界分享。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Result: 20个大模型操作安全性均较差，提示引导方法能显著提升模型OOD拒绝能力。

Conclusion: 操作安全干预迫切，提示引导方法是迈向可靠大模型代理的第一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Motivation: 为评估计算机使用代理在Salesforce平台客户关系管理工作流中的表现，推动复杂商业软件生态中可靠计算机使用代理的构建。

Method: 创建包含300个来自真实用户访谈任务实例的SCUBA基准，在Salesforce沙盒环境中，对不同代理在零样本和示范增强设置下进行基准测试。

Result: 不同代理设计范式和开源、闭源模型间存在巨大性能差距。零样本设置下，开源模型成功率低于5%，闭源最高达39%；示范增强设置下，成功率提升至50%，时间和成本分别降低13%和16%。

Conclusion: 企业任务自动化存在挑战，但代理解决方案有前景，SCUBA可加速构建可靠计算机使用代理的进展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Motivation: 现有扩散变压器稀疏注意力设计难以兼顾二维空间局部性和GPU效率，现有方法在保证局部性时会产生非合并内存访问。

Method: 沿希尔伯特曲线重新排序图像令牌以实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度，引入中央共享区域。

Result: 在Flux.1 - dev上实现显著加速，生成1024×1024图像时加速2.3倍，2048×2048时加速达4.17倍，图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: 证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力用于高分辨率图像生成的可行性。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Conclusion: 当前模型能力与实际物理研究需求存在巨大差距，CritPt可为科学AI工具开发提供基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗保健领域应用存在指定准确奖励困难和探索不安全、数据需求大的障碍。

Method: 提出两阶段框架，先从无奖励专家演示数据集学习安全初始策略，再用基于偏好的人类反馈在线微调；提出统一算法BRIDGE，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 推导了随离线演示数量减少的后悔边界，在离散和连续控制MuJoCo环境中验证BRIDGE，其后悔值低于独立行为克隆和在线基于偏好的强化学习。

Conclusion: 为设计更具样本效率的交互式智能体建立了理论基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励对强化学习至关重要，但机器人领域手动设计奖励费力且缺乏可扩展性，需新方法。

Method: 提出TimeRewarder方法，通过对帧对的时间距离建模，从被动视频推导进度估计信号，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在十个Meta - World任务实验中，显著提升稀疏奖励任务的强化学习效果，9/10任务接近完美成功，在最终成功率和样本效率上优于先前方法和手动设计奖励，还能利用人类视频。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder是一种可扩展方法，能从多样视频源获取丰富奖励信号。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward

TL;DR: 本文介绍测量树，一种新型度量，能将不同构造组合成可解释的多层次表示，可增强AI评估的透明度和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 响应扩大AI系统评估范围的号召，解决传统度量的局限性，增强度量透明度并促进异质证据整合。

Method: 给出测量树的定义和示例，通过大规模测量实践展示其实用性，并提供开源Python代码。

Result: 展示了测量树能产生层次化有向图，且通过实践证明其在AI评估中的实用价值。

Conclusion: 测量树为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了有原则的基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

Conclusion: 所提出的神经求解器在给定相应计算机辅助设计模型的情况下，有潜力解决复杂工程问题。

Abstract: This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed
neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial
differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method
utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of
isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between
non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface
neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by
minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial
differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is
demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases,
namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear
solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show
excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite
element solvers, thus highlighting the potential of the suggested neural solver
to tackle complex engineering problems given the corresponding computer-aided
design models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估缺乏针对PostGIS环境GeoSQL任务的系统基准，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于Webb的DOK模型构建GeoSQL - Eval框架，开发GeoSQL - Bench数据集，运用熵权法和统计分析评估模型。

Result: 系统评估24个模型，揭示性能、误差分布和资源消耗模式差异，建立公开排行榜。

Conclusion: 研究成果拓展NL2SQL应用，为评估大语言模型在空间数据库中的性能提供标准化、可解释和可扩展的框架。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation
(NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS
environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions,
geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily
focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,
leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To
address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end
automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's
Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive
dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a
comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge
acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and
robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset
comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,
and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically
evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying
entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in
performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.
Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables
global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These
contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also
provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating
LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for
model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban
studies, and spatial analysis.

Motivation: 降低现代数据密集型应用开发者的架构复杂性，提供更强大、安全且对开发者友好的平台。

Method: 将单写入者参与者模型、增量视图维护和零信任安全模型整合到单个系统。

Result: 提出核心架构，讨论设计权衡，定义最小可行产品的性能标准。

Conclusion: ActorDB比手动集成不同系统的解决方案更具优势。

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

TL;DR: 提出用于关系数据库错误检测的PAT框架，实验表明其表现出色且能减少模型参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关系数据库错误检测的多检测器方法成本高，数据预处理策略未利用数据序列可变长度特性，导致准确率降低。

Method: 引入学习模式模块捕获特定属性数据分布；设计QTA分词器生成自适应数据标记；交错数据标记和特定属性模式标记以学习特征；可视化注意力图解释错误检测机制。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PAT取得了出色的F1分数，应用紧凑QTA分词器时显著减少了模型参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: PAT框架在关系数据库错误检测中表现良好，具有一定优势。

Abstract: Error detection in relational databases is critical for maintaining data
quality and is fundamental to tasks such as data cleaning and assessment.
Current error detection studies mostly employ the multi-detector approach to
handle heterogeneous attributes in databases, incurring high costs.
Additionally, their data preprocessing strategies fail to leverage the
variable-length characteristic of data sequences, resulting in reduced
accuracy. In this paper, we propose an attribute-wise PAttern-perceptive
Transformer (PAT) framework for error detection in relational databases. First,
PAT introduces a learned pattern module that captures attribute-specific data
distributions through learned embeddings during model training. Second, the
Quasi-Tokens Arrangement (QTA) tokenizer is designed to divide the cell
sequence based on its length and word types, and then generate the
word-adaptive data tokens, meanwhile providing compact hyperparameters to
ensure efficiency. By interleaving data tokens with the attribute-specific
pattern tokens, PAT jointly learns shared data features across different
attributes and pattern features that are distinguishable and unique in each
specified attribute. Third, PAT visualizes the attention map to interpret its
error detection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that PAT achieves
excellent F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art data error detection methods.
Moreover, PAT significantly reduces the model parameters and FLOPs when
applying the compact QTA tokenizer.

Conclusion: 这种生物 - 语言类比为跨生态系统基础设施提供语义优先基础，为FAIR数据和服务互联网及未来学术交流铺平道路。

Abstract: The FAIR Principles aim to make data and knowledge Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable, yet current digital infrastructures often lack a
unifying semantic framework that bridges human cognition and
machine-actionability. In this paper, we introduce the Grammar of FAIR: a
granular and modular architecture for FAIR semantics built on the concept of
semantic units. Semantic units, comprising atomic statement units and composite
compound units, implement the principle of semantic modularisation, decomposing
data and knowledge into independently identifiable, semantically meaningful,
and machine-actionable units. A central metaphor guiding our approach is the
analogy between the hierarchy of level of organisation in biological systems
and the hierarchy of levels of organisation in information systems: both are
structured by granular building blocks that mediate across multiple
perspectives while preserving functional unity. Drawing further inspiration
from concept formation and natural language grammar, we show how these building
blocks map to FAIR Digitial Objects (FDOs), enabling format-agnostic semantic
transitivity from natural language token models to schema-based
representations. This dual biological-linguistic analogy provides a
semantics-first foundation for evolving cross-ecosystem infrastructures, paving
the way for the Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS) and a future of
modular, AI-ready, and citation-granular scholarly communication.

TL;DR: 本文通过对以太坊主网超33.5万个区块交易多次排列执行，量化和分析交易随机排序的协议违规、执行错误和gas消耗偏差，认为谨慎处理交易选择时随机交易排序技术上可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期有提议用随机交易排序减轻以太坊生态中心化影响和提升公平性，但交易和区块有gas限制和协议规则，需考察其技术可部署性。

Method: 对超33.5万个以太坊主网区块的交易进行多次排列和执行。

Result: 约22%的区块排列因私有挖矿交易或接近gas限制导致协议违规而无效；几乎所有排列时出现执行错误但原顺序无错误的交易是私有挖矿交易；仅6%的交易gas消耗有偏差，98%的区块排列gas消耗与原消耗偏差至多10%。

Conclusion: 从技术角度看，若谨慎处理交易选择，随机交易排序可能可行。

Abstract: Several recent proposals implicitly or explicitly suggest making use of
randomized transaction ordering within a block to mitigate centralization
effects and to improve fairness in the Ethereum ecosystem. However,
transactions and blocks are subject to gas limits and protocol rules. In a
randomized transaction order, the behavior of transactions may change depending
on other transactions in the same block, leading to invalid blocks and varying
gas consumptions. In this paper, we quantify and characterize protocol
violations, execution errors and deviations in gas consumption of blocks and
transactions to examine technical deployability. For that, we permute and
execute the transactions of over 335,000 Ethereum Mainnet blocks multiple
times. About 22% of block permutations are invalid due to protocol violations
caused by privately mined transactions or blocks close to their gas limit.
Also, almost all transactions which show execution errors under permutation but
not in the original order are privately mined transactions. Only 6% of
transactions show deviations in gas consumption and 98% of block permutations
deviate at most 10% from their original gas consumption. From a technical
perspective, these results suggest that randomized transaction ordering may be
feasible if transaction selection is handled carefully.

TL;DR: 本文提出Sharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL)和Blockchain - enabled SplitFed Learning (BSFL)框架，解决SplitFed Learning (SFL)可扩展性、性能和安全问题，实验显示SSFL提升性能和可扩展性，BSFL增强抗数据投毒攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL)和Split Learning (SL)有局限，SFL虽结合二者优势但仍有可扩展性、性能和安全问题，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出SSFL框架，通过多并行分片分配SL服务器工作负载和通信开销；在SSFL基础上提出BSFL，用区块链架构和委员会驱动共识机制，加入评估机制排除中毒或篡改模型更新。

Result: SSFL使性能和可扩展性分别提升31.2%和85.2%；BSFL使抗数据投毒攻击能力提升62.7%，正常运行时性能优越。

Conclusion: BSFL是首个实现端到端去中心化SplitFed Learning系统的区块链框架。

Abstract: Collaborative and distributed learning techniques, such as Federated Learning
(FL) and Split Learning (SL), hold significant promise for leveraging sensitive
data in privacy-critical domains. However, FL and SL suffer from key
limitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while
SL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed
Learning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths
of FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,
and security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:
Sharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning
(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by
distributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across
multiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized
server with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven
consensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an
evaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby
mitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations
against baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and
scalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases
resilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior
performance under normal operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
BSFL is the first blockchain-enabled framework to implement an end-to-end
decentralized SplitFed Learning system.

Conclusion: LAPIS有效解决了现有编程模型在便携性、性能、生产力、代码集成和扩展性方面的问题。

Abstract: Portability, performance, and productivity are three critical dimensions for
evaluating a programming model or compiler infrastructure. Several modern
programming models for computational science focus on performance and
portability. On the other end, several machine learning focused programming
models focus on portability and productivity. A clear solution that is strong
in all three dimensions has yet to emerge. A second related problem arises when
use cases from computational science converge with machine learning. The
disparate popular frameworks of these fields require programmers to manually
integrate codes written in different frameworks. Finally, several programming
frameworks lack easy options for extensibility as any new computer architecture
change require complex changes to the programming models. We present LAPIS, an
MLIR-based compiler that addresses all three of these challenges. We
demonstrate that LAPIS can automatically lower sparse and dense linear algebra
kernels from computational science and artificial intelligence use cases. We
also show how LAPIS facilitates the integration of codes between PyTorch and
Kokkos. We compare kernel performance with the default MLIR implementations on
diverse architectures to demonstrate portability. By developing a dialect that
is built on the principles of the Kokkos ecosystem, LAPIS also allows
extensibility of the framework to new architectures.

Motivation: 当前自动调优搜索空间构建存在瓶颈，现有技术缺乏形式化基础且适用范围有限。

Method: 将搜索空间构建问题转化为CSP，开发运行时解析器，优化求解器，并集成到开源工具。

Result: 优化后的求解器相比暴力枚举、未优化CSP求解器和基于链式树的自动调优框架，分别减少四个、三个和一到两个数量级的构建时间。

Conclusion: 消除了自动调优的可扩展性障碍，为自动调优等领域提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning, or auto-tuning, accelerates high-performance
codes by exploring vast spaces of code variants. However, due to the large
number of possible combinations and complex constraints, constructing these
search spaces can be a major bottleneck. Real-world applications have been
encountered where the search space construction takes minutes to hours or even
days. Current state-of-the-art techniques for search space construction, such
as chain-of-trees, lack a formal foundation and only perform adequately on a
specific subset of search spaces.
  We show that search space construction for constraint-based auto-tuning can
be reformulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Building on this
insight with a CSP solver, we develop a runtime parser that translates
user-defined constraint functions into solver-optimal expressions, optimize the
solver to exploit common structures in auto-tuning constraints, and integrate
these and other advances in open-source tools. These contributions
substantially improve performance and accessibility while preserving
flexibility.
  We evaluate our approach using a diverse set of benchmarks, demonstrating
that our optimized solver reduces construction time by four orders of magnitude
versus brute-force enumeration, three orders of magnitude versus an unoptimized
CSP solver, and one to two orders of magnitude versus leading auto-tuning
frameworks built on chain-of-trees. We thus eliminate a critical scalability
barrier for auto-tuning and provide a drop-in solution that enables the
exploration of previously unattainable problem scales in auto-tuning and
related domains.

Method: 提出PAST框架，包含PilotAO和AdaptAO两个互补机制，前者建立长期协议提高资源利用率，后者动态更新协议和超订率。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验，PAST在决策开销、任务完成延迟、资源利用率和社会福利方面优于基准方法。

Conclusion: PAST结合预测规划和实时调整，为提高低空任务性能提供了鲁棒和自适应实践参考。

Abstract: Incentive-driven resource trading is essential for UAV applications with
intensive, time-sensitive computing demands. Traditional spot trading suffers
from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures
trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To
address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading),
a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism.
PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements
with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage
decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial
agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading
agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that
dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility,
supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms
enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality,
strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently
outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion
latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive
planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust
and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.

Conclusion: 存储辅助推理实用可扩展，存储是高效低延迟部署大语言模型的有力手段。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency,
particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge
deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel
storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by
precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user
query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive
GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing
latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer
employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and
deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two
techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar
queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters
to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded
and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast,
similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K
unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up
to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation
across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of
storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query
distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage
as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.

Abstract: Network Interface Cards (NICs) greatly evolved from simple basic devices
moving traffic in and out of the network to complex heterogeneous systems
offloading host CPUs from performing complex tasks on in-transit packets. These
latter comprise different types of devices, ranging from NICs accelerating
fixed specific functions (e.g., on-the-fly data compression/decompression,
checksum computation, data encryption, etc.) to complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC)
equipped with both general purpose processors and specialized engines
(Smart-NICs). Similarly, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) moved from pure
reprogrammable devices to modern heterogeneous systems comprising
general-purpose processors, real-time cores and even AI-oriented engines.
Furthermore, the availability of high-speed network interfaces (e.g., SFPs)
makes modern FPGAs a good choice for implementing Smart-NICs. In this work, we
extended the functionalities offered by an open-source NIC implementation
(Corundum) by enabling time-aware traffic management in hardware, and using
this feature to control the bandwidth associated with different traffic
classes. By exposing dedicated control registers on the AXI bus, the driver of
the NIC can easily configure the transmission bandwidth of different
prioritized queues. Basically, each control register is associated with a
specific transmission queue (Corundum can expose up to thousands of
transmission and receiving queues), and sets up the fraction of time in a
transmission window which the queue is supposed to get access the output port
and transmit the packets. Queues are then prioritized and associated to
different traffic classes through the Linux QDISC mechanism. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the approach allows to properly manage the
bandwidth reserved to the different transmission flows.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on
large datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses
on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to
accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often
employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can
lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method
built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training
efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support
while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By
using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing
loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time.
Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning,
we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually
adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly
boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual
batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and
training efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared
to conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while
reducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1%
while reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.

Motivation: 集中式大语言模型推理服务部署成本高，利用协作式去中心化GPU池是有吸引力的替代方案，但存在GPU异构、网络带宽有限等调度挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段调度器，包括模型分配（在内存和带宽约束下优化延迟和吞吐量）和请求时GPU管道选择（平衡负载并适应当前条件）。

Result: 在开源大语言模型和真实志愿节点上评估，相比去中心化基线，Parallax持续降低延迟并提高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 合理的调度能使志愿计算成为大语言模型推理实用且经济的基础。

Abstract: Deploying a large language model (LLM) inference service remains costly
because centralized serving depends on specialized GPU clusters and
high-bandwidth interconnects in datacenters. An appealing alternative is to
leverage collaborative decentralized GPU pools. However, heterogeneity in GPU
and limited interconnected network bandwidth, along with potentially dynamic
availability, make efficient scheduling the central challenge in this scenario.
In this paper, we present Parallax, a decentralized LLM serving system that
turns a pool of heterogeneous GPUs into an efficient inference platform via a
two-phase scheduler. Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation,
which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize
latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii)
request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different
replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to
current conditions. We implement Parallax and evaluate it on open-source LLMs
deployed over real volunteer nodes. Parallax consistently reduces latency and
increases throughput relative to decentralized baselines, demonstrating that
principled scheduling can make volunteer compute a practical, affordable
substrate for LLM inference.

Motivation: 人脑详细运作机制不明，脑模拟受计算需求和连通性更新、脉冲交换通信开销限制，需改进。

Method: 提出通过移动计算而非移动数据来减少通信开销的新算法。

Result: 将更新连通性时间缩短为原来的六分之一，脉冲交换时间缩短两个数量级以上。

Conclusion: 新算法有效降低通信开销，提升脑模拟效率。

Abstract: The detailed functioning of the human brain is still poorly understood. Brain
simulations are a well-established way to complement experimental research, but
must contend with the computational demands of the approximately $10^{11}$
neurons and the $10^{14}$ synapses connecting them, the network of the latter
referred to as the connectome. Studies suggest that changes in the connectome
(i.e., the formation and deletion of synapses, also known as structural
plasticity) are essential for critical tasks such as memory formation and
learning. The connectivity update can be efficiently computed using a
Barnes-Hut-inspired approximation that lowers the computational complexity from
$O(n^2)$ to $O(n log n)$, where n is the number of neurons. However, updating
synapses, which relies heavily on RMA, and the spike exchange between neurons,
which requires all-to-all communication at every time step, still hinder
scalability. We present a new algorithm that significantly reduces the
communication overhead by moving computation instead of data. This shrinks the
time it takes to update connectivity by a factor of six and the time it takes
to exchange spikes by more than two orders of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障检测技术难以在部署前暴露分布式系统中的自维持级联故障，因其需特定条件组合触发且涉及复杂故障传播。

Method: 提出CSnake框架，采用因果拼接思想，设计故障因果分析（FCA）识别故障传播链，使用三阶段测试预算分配协议，执行局部兼容性检查。

Result: CSnake在五个系统中检测出15个导致自维持级联故障的漏洞，其中5个已确认，2个已修复。

Conclusion: CSnake框架能有效暴露分布式系统中的自维持级联故障。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that self-sustaining cascading failures in
distributed systems frequently lead to widespread outages, which are
challenging to contain and recover from. Existing failure detection techniques
struggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require
a complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge
stems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve
a sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.
  This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose
self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the
novel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault
injections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To
identify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of
fault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution
trace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same
test w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which
are considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.
  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake
employs a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes
faults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood
of uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly
connecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions,
CSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the
compatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault
propagations with low overhead.
  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five
systems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed.

Motivation: 为无多项式核的参数化问题寻找不同的预处理方法，以产生实践中易解的实例。

Method: 结合已知数据结构和新思想，为问题设计见证验证协议；给出特定问题的ILP和MILP公式。

Result: 该性质与WK[1]类重合；为r - Way Cut等多个问题设计了协议，表明可由紧凑ILP建模；给出加权顶点覆盖问题在特定图上的ILP和MILP公式。

Conclusion: 研究结果为参数化问题的面向ILP的预处理程序的系统研究提供背景。

Abstract: The standard formalization of preprocessing in parameterized complexity is
given by kernelization. In this work, we depart from this paradigm and study a
different type of preprocessing for problems without polynomial kernels, still
aiming at producing instances that are easily solvable in practice.
Specifically, we ask for which parameterized problems an instance (I,k) can be
reduced in polynomial time to an integer linear program (ILP) with poly(k)
constraints.
  We show that this property coincides with the parameterized complexity class
WK[1], previously studied in the context of Turing kernelization lower bounds.
In turn, the class WK[1] enjoys an elegant characterization in terms of witness
verification protocols: a yes-instance should admit a witness of size poly(k)
that can be verified in time poly(k). By combining known data structures with
new ideas, we design such protocols for several problems, such as r-Way Cut,
Vertex Multiway Cut, Steiner Tree, or Minimum Common String Partition, thus
showing that they can be modeled by compact ILPs. We also present explicit ILP
and MILP formulations for Weighted Vertex Cover on graphs with small
(unweighted) vertex cover number. We believe that these results will provide a
background for a systematic study of ILP-oriented preprocessing procedures for
parameterized problems.

Motivation: 受近期相关工作启发，研究在线排序和在线旅行商问题的随机版本，寻求更好的在线放置策略以接近最优排序。

Method: 将请求序列分解为球放入箱的实例层次结构。

Result: 得到一个在线算法，以高概率在 $O(\log^2 n)$ 因子内近似最优成本。

Conclusion: 相比之前结果，竞争比有指数级提升。

Abstract: In \emph{Online Sorting}, an array of $n$ initially empty cells is given. At
each time step $t$, an element $x_t \in [0,1]$ arrives and must be placed
irrevocably into an empty cell without any knowledge of future arrivals. We aim
to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of elements placed in
consecutive array cells, seeking an online placement strategy that results in a
final array close to a sorted one. An interesting multidimensional
generalization, a.k.a. the \emph{Online Travelling Salesperson Problem}, arises
when the request sequence consists of points in the $d$-dimensional unit cube
and the objective is to minimize the sum of euclidean distances between points
in consecutive cells. Motivated by the recent work of (Abrahamsen, Bercea,
Beretta, Klausen and Kozma; ESA 2024), we consider the \emph{stochastic
version} of Online Sorting (\textit{resp.} Online TSP), where each element
(\textit{resp.} point) $x_t$ is an i.i.d. sample from the uniform distribution
on $[0, 1]$ (\textit{resp.} $[0,1]^d$). By carefully decomposing the request
sequence into a hierarchy of balls-into-bins instances, where the balls to bins
ratio is large enough so that bin occupancy is sharply concentrated around its
mean and small enough so that we can efficiently deal with the elements placed
in the same bin, we obtain an online algorithm that approximates the optimal
cost within a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ with high probability. Our result
comprises an exponential improvement on the previously best known competitive
ratio of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for Stochastic Online Sorting due to (Abrahamsen
et al.; ESA 2024) and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for (adversarial) Online TSP due to
(Bertram, ESA 2025).

Conclusion: 新算法是实际场景中计算单源k条简单最短路径的首选解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in
weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple
shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied
over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements
emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention
has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is
determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other
vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest
paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to
this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of
the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first
polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand,
we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the
best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the
problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to
each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other
hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and
synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and
significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time,
achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results
establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$
simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.

Result: 得到了用于确定k - 循环图建模网络广播时间的(1.5 - ε)近似算法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法可用于解决k - 循环图建模网络的广播时间问题。

Abstract: Broadcasting is an information dissemination primitive where a message
originates at a node (called the originator) and is passed to all other nodes
in the network. Broadcasting research is motivated by efficient network design
and determining the broadcast times of standard network topologies. Verifying
the broadcast time of a node $v$ in an arbitrary network $G$ is known to be
NP-hard. Additionally, recent findings show that the broadcast time problem is
also NP-complete in general cactus graphs and some highly restricted
subfamilies of cactus graphs. These graph families are structurally similar to
$k$-cycle graphs, in which the broadcast time problem is also believed to be
NP-complete. In this paper, we present a simple $(1.5-\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for determining the broadcast time of networks modeled using
$k$-cycle graphs, where $\epsilon > 0$ depends on the structure of the graph.

Abstract: A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on
workload shifting, which aligns the timing of energy consumption with external
signals such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use
electricity prices. The main challenge lies in the online nature of the
problem: operators must make real-time decisions (e.g., whether to consume
energy now) without knowledge of the future. While forecasts of signal values
are typically available, prior work on learning-augmented online algorithms has
relied almost exclusively on simple point forecasts. In parallel, the
forecasting research has made significant progress in uncertainty
quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive
information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage
UQ predictors to improve decision-making. We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a
learning-augmented algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts
through a $\textit{decision uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast
uncertainty affects optimal future decisions. By introducing
$\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes how performance
degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish theoretical performance
guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on
carbon intensity and electricity price data, we demonstrate that
$\texttt{UQ-Advice}$ consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing
learning-augmented methods that ignore uncertainty.

Conclusion: 所提两步优化框架能有效解决最大最小约束下公平影响最大化问题，且有理论保证。

Abstract: Aiming to reduce disparities of influence across different groups, Fair
Influence Maximization (FIM) has recently garnered widespread attention. The
maximin constraint, a common notion of fairness adopted in the FIM problem,
imposes a direct and intuitive requirement that asks the utility (influenced
ratio within a group) of the worst-off group should be maximized. Although the
objective of FIM under maximin constraint is conceptually straightforward, the
development of efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees remains
an open challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the maximin
objective does not satisfy submodularity, a key property for designing
approximate algorithms in traditional influence maximization settings. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing a two-step optimization framework
consisting of Inner-group Maximization (IGM) and Across-group Maximization
(AGM). We first prove that the influence spread within any individual group
remains submodular, enabling effective optimization within groups. Based on
this, IGM applies a greedy approach to pick high-quality seeds for each group.
In the second step, AGM coordinates seed selection across groups by introducing
two strategies: Uniform Selection (US) and Greedy Selection (GS). We prove that
AGM-GS holds a $(1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)$ approximation to the optimal solution
when groups are completely disconnected, while AGM-US guarantees a roughly
$\frac{1}{m}(1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)$ lower bound regardless of the group
structure, with $m$ denoting the number of groups

Abstract: Information design is typically studied through the lens of Bayesian
signaling, where signals shape beliefs based on their correlation with the true
state of the world. However, Behavioral Economics and Psychology emphasize that
human decision-making is more complex and can depend on how information is
framed. This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges
this to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly
non-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a
signaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the
classic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this
framework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of
predicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large
Language Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we
formulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle.
This model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing
framing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable. We
substantiate our theoretical analysis with an empirical algorithm that
leverages LLMs to (1) approximate the framing-to-belief oracle, and (2)
optimize over language space using a hill-climbing method. We apply this to two
marketing-inspired case studies and validate the effectiveness through
analytical and human evaluation.

Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of
Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and
exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games.
While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to
large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they
do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We
present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer
imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program
based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form
game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving
nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve
three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available
algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response
approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes
longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our
formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in
multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous
quadratically-constrained program formulation.

Abstract: Efficient coordination in multi-agent systems often incurs high communication
overhead or slow convergence rates, making scalable welfare optimization
difficult. We propose Single-Bit Coordination Dynamics for Pareto-Efficient
Outcomes (SBC-PE), a decentralized learning algorithm requiring only a
single-bit satisfaction signal per agent each round. Despite this extreme
efficiency, SBC-PE guarantees convergence to the exact optimal solution in
arbitrary finite games. We establish explicit regret bounds, showing expected
regret grows only logarithmically with the horizon, i.e., O(log T). Compared
with prior payoff-based or bandit-style rules, SBC-PE uniquely combines minimal
signaling, general applicability, and finite-time guarantees. These results
show scalable welfare optimization is achievable under minimal communication
constraints.

Abstract: Investigative journalists routinely confront large document collections.
Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

locally-deployable language models that preserve data security and maintain
complete auditability through explicit citation chains. Evaluating three
quantized models (Gemma 3 12B, Qwen 3 14B, and GPT-OSS 20B) on two corpora, we
find substantial variation in reliability. All models achieved high citation
validity and ran effectively on standard desktop hardware (e.g., 24 GB of
memory), demonstrating feasibility for resource-constrained newsrooms. However,
systematic challenges emerged, including error propagation through multi-stage
synthesis and dramatic performance variation based on training data overlap
with corpus content. These findings suggest that effective newsroom AI
deployment requires careful model selection and system design, alongside human
oversight for maintaining standards of accuracy and accountability.

Abstract: LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in
advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has
progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments
as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,
existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting
strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To
fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based
Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for
usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in
relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible
workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to
evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,
coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE
on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE
achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary
focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based
relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across
multiple dimensions.

Motivation: 现有多行为推荐方法用图神经网络统一建模用户意图，未充分考虑不同行为异质性，高频低意图行为含噪声和误导性频繁模式，阻碍用户意图学习。

Method: 提出HiFIRec方法，通过差分行为建模修正影响；分层抑制噪声信号，通过自适应跨层特征融合捕获用户意图；提出强度感知非采样策略动态调整负样本权重。

Result: 在两个基准测试上，HiFIRec相对几个先进方法使HR@10提升4.21%-6.81%。

Conclusion: HiFIRec方法有效，能修正高频低意图行为影响，提升多行为推荐性能。

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item
interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing
personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most
existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a
unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different
behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may
implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible
while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this
end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,
that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by
differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically
suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through
layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions
through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent
patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically
adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over
several state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 金融交易数据复杂，需要先进技术进行分析，Transformer模型在多领域表现出色，因此探索其在金融交易理解中的潜力。

Method: 对三种Transformer模型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器 - 解码器）进行实验，每种类型探索预训练大语言模型、微调大语言模型和从头开发的小专有模型三种选项。

Result: 大语言模型在金融交易理解中未显著优于小专有模型，专有模型在速度和成本效率上表现更好。

Conclusion: 模型选择应基于特定领域需求，定制的专有模型在专业应用中比通用大语言模型更具优势，最终选用专有解码器模型提升了交易覆盖并节省成本。

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流行降维方法如PCA和UMAP无法保留向量间最近邻关系，难以用于加速检索过程。

Method: 提出正则化自动编码器RAE，通过正则化项约束网络参数变化，调整奇异值控制嵌入幅度变化以保留k - NN关系，并进行数学分析。

Result: RAE在适度训练开销下，比现有降维方法有更好的k - NN召回率，同时保持快速检索效率。

Conclusion: RAE能有效解决现有降维方法在保留最近邻关系上的不足，可用于加速检索过程。

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出离散扩散推荐系统PreferGrow，通过对偏好比例离散建模、偏好衰减扰动和偏好增长重建用户偏好，在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有扩散推荐器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散推荐器使用连续高斯噪声与推荐中用户偏好数据的离散性质不匹配，为解决数据稀疏问题并适配离散特性。

Method: 提出PreferGrow系统，包括对偏好比例进行离散建模、通过偏好衰减进行扰动、通过偏好增长重建用户偏好，有基于矩阵的公式并具备理论保证。

Result: PreferGrow在五个基准数据集上比现有扩散推荐器有持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: PreferGrow理论合理且经验有效。

Abstract: Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user
interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent
advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which
alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the
collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current
diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,
which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference
data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in
discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based
recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user
preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing
diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of
preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item
pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.
This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature
of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of
injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the
preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --
thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference
reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by
iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.
PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical
guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across
five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and
empirical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出Items Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC)框架，可作通用插件用于多数基于协同过滤的知识图谱推荐模型，解决现有方法局限和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可批判推荐系统方法构建特定模型限制应用场景，且忽略灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 概念化用户与关键词之间的代理，提出IPGC框架，将用户 - 关键词对的批判优化目标转换为用户 - 项目对，引入抗遗忘正则化器。

Result: 为主流推荐场景提供无缝集成批判机制的新范例。

Conclusion: IPGC框架可作为通用插件实现迭代推荐优化，有效缓解模型灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user
experience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine
recommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements,
critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model
parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing
keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first
constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations
between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative
recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.
Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,
where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step
critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize
a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items
Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a
universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on
collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for
frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative
recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC
describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing
optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting
it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically
designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting
regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.

Motivation: 现有顺序行为模型在建模用户序列时不能有效捕捉场景和物品间动态兴趣与相互作用，而场景特征对提升预测性能重要且常被忽视。

Method: 提出DSPnet，包含两个并行网络学习用户对物品和场景的动态兴趣，以及序列特征增强模块；引入CCR损失捕捉相似历史序列不变性。

Result: 在一个公开基准和两个工业数据集上实验，上线系统后CTR提升0.04点，交易增长0.78%，GMV增长0.64%。

Conclusion: DSPnet是学习场景和物品序列联合关系的有效方法。

Abstract: Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial
in improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight
the importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction
performance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the
scene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by
developers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search"
and ``live" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct
functionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in
user engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore
the scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot
effectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and
items when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual
Sequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic
interests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior
prediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'
dynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement
module to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.
Further, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to
capture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis
suggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships
between scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one
public benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been
deployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\%
growth in deals, and 0.64\% rise in GMV. The codes are available at this

We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the

Conclusion: 提出的方法可克服相位恢复中非线性问题的限制。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse
imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images:
one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground
truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled
data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to
reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for
references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding
non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised
method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using
the natural invariance of images to translations.

Motivation: 尽管BEV发展迅速，但存在续航焦虑、公共充电不便和成本高等障碍，需评估用户换用BEV潜力。

Method: 分析大量ICE车辆用户的遥测数据，复制行程和停车事件，模拟并监测电池电量状态。

Result: 揭示了充电行为和BEV有限续航之间的折衷，假设可进行夜间充电，至少35%用户可采用低容量BEV。

Conclusion: 在有夜间充电条件下，部分用户具备换用BEV的潜力。

Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are rapidly evolving from a niche
alternative to an established option for private transportation, often
replacing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite growing interest,
significant barriers remain, including range anxiety, the inconvenience
associated with public charging stations, and higher costs. This study analyses
extensive telemetry data collected from 10,441 users using ICE vehicles in an
Italian province to assess the potential for switching to BEVs without changing
current travel behaviour. We evaluate to what extent the BEV models can fulfil
their mobility needs under different charging scenarios. To do so, we replicate
trips and parking events, simulating and monitoring the battery state of
charge. The analysis reveals the compromises between charging behaviours and
limited BEV autonomy. Assuming access to overnight charging, at least 35% of
the users could already adopt even low-capacity BEVs.

Motivation: 现有多模态检索评估基准主要探测表面语义对应，无法评估捕捉复杂关系所需的深度推理能力，不能满足更现实和更具挑战性场景的需求。

Method: 引入MR² - Bench基准，该基准任务由推理驱动，有多样多模态数据，支持复杂查询和多图文档，涵盖多种检索场景。

Result: 当前最先进模型在现有基准表现好，但在MR² - Bench上表现差，如Seed1.6 - Embedding模型在MMEB上Recall@1为77.78，在MR² - Bench上仅9.91。

Conclusion: MR² - Bench增加了评估挑战，凸显推理密集型多模态检索需进一步发展。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

Abstract: The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic
methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than
empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that
implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset
selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three
metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework
with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into
five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a
variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure
similarity. The APS Explorer was successfully developed with three interactive
modules for visualizing algorithm performance, direct comparing algorithms, and
analyzing dataset metadata. This tool shifts the process of selecting datasets
from intuition-based to evidence-based practices, and it is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi - Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)计算需求大，现有基于稀疏性的加速方法通用性受限。

Method: 引入灵活稀疏符号标准化多种稀疏策略表示，使不同稀疏计算能在单个注意力内核执行；为注意力块设计优化的稀疏GEMMs，利用稀疏符号消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM - Q上实现接近线性的加速，GEMM - O有2.5× - 3.8×加速，应用于Hunyuan模型能实现约1.5×端到端加速。

Conclusion: FlashOmni能有效加速DiT架构计算，且不降低视觉质量，具有较好的通用性和加速效果。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Motivation: 解决具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，拓展神经VWAP执行策略的应用场景。

Method: 提出LEMs架构，将市场信息处理与执行分配决策分离，用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理不同场景执行逻辑。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易中，LEMs通过动态优化执行路径，表现优于传统基准。

Conclusion: LEMs统一模型架构可通过单一框架用于不同执行场景，相比特定资产方法有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more
data.

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉 - 语言框架的拼图解决方法，实验显示优于现有模型，确立新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图解决方法多关注视觉线索，少用自然语言描述提供语义指导，尤其是针对侵蚀间隙拼图。

Method: 提出视觉 - 语言框架，核心是VLHSA模块，通过多级语义匹配将视觉块与文本描述对齐，模块集成结合双视觉编码器和语言特征的多模态架构进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有模型，拼块准确率提升14.2个百分点，消融实验证实VLHSA模块关键作用。

Conclusion: 工作通过融入多模态语义见解，为拼图解决建立了新范式。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出Norm - Q方法压缩概率符号模型，实验显示其比传统量化方法有更高压缩率，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号应用中使用的HMM会继承并放大两种方法的缺点，组件计算和数据传输密集，通信影响性能，需压缩模型。

Method: 提出Norm - Q归一化线性量化方法，引入归一化量化感知期望最大化过程用于概率模型训练。

Result: Norm - Q比传统量化方法有更高压缩率，在大语言模型受限生成任务中能有效量化HMM，可实现99%的权重压缩率。

Conclusion: Norm - Q方法能在合理损失下实现概率符号模型的高效压缩，适合部署在定制硬件上。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法如熵最小化技术存在计算开销大、无法有效利用历史标记上下文的问题。

Method: 提出 SLS 方法，维护 top - K 对数的滑动缓冲区，进行实时奇异值分解确定主导光谱方向，基于熵和对数差距统计自适应重新缩放对数，仅在不确定性高时激活。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS 始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编码和科学推理任务中实现更高准确性。

Conclusion: SLS 无需更新模型参数，能有效锐化输出分布并保持上下文一致性，可提升大语言模型可靠性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 将控制理论与广告系统结合，为预算分配提供可扩展且可靠的解决方案，对小预算活动尤其有益。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

TL;DR: 提出针对自动调优中优化算法的超参数调优新方法，能降低成本并显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调优中优化算法的超参数几乎未被调优，其潜在性能影响未被研究。

Method: 提出评估超参数性能的统计方法，发布数据集和软件，引入模拟模式。

Result: 有限超参数调优平均提升自动调优器性能94.8%，用元策略优化超参数平均提升204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是推动自动调优研究和实践的有力技术。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Motivation: 现有领先的自监督学习方法（如GRACE）与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，需要开发兼容的方法。

Method: 提出由完全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数组成的Poly - GRACE框架。

Conclusion: 该工作是迈向实用且高性能隐私保护图表示学习的重要一步。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集实验中，该方法在分箱任务上优于确定性的k - mer和基于大语言模型的嵌入方法，提供了可扩展且轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: UncertainGen方法能自然建模序列级不确定性，在宏基因组分箱任务上有优势。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

Result: 在某些数据集上，使用双曲优化方法训练的扩散模型能更快收敛且不牺牲生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在训练早期能加速收敛，在扩散模型训练中有良好表现。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Conclusion: PageANN在性能和可扩展性上表现优异，显著优于现有基于磁盘的ANNS方法。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将基线数值天气预报（NWP）模型的临界成功指数（CSI）从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%覆盖的强降雨事件，其分数技能得分（FSS）超过0.45，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了有效的强降雨预测长尾范式，为增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

Conclusion: 强调获取扩张和可扩张性全场测量值对揭示TAA发病机制和制定个性化治疗策略的重要性。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for

TL;DR: 提出CoA - LoRA方法，无需重复微调即可动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置，通过帕累托配置搜索优化训练配置集，实验表明性能优且无额外时间成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为不同量化配置进行微调计算成本高，而边缘设备能力异构，需有效方法动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置。

Method: 提出CoA - LoRA方法，通过配置感知模型映射配置到低秩调整，设计帕累托配置搜索优化训练配置集。

Result: 实验表明CoA - LoRA无需额外时间成本，性能与现有方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: CoA - LoRA是一种有效方法，可在不增加时间成本下，使预训练模型适应边缘设备不同量化配置。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

TL;DR: 提出名为PARADISE的多元时间序列无监督分区异常检测方法，实验显示该方法提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多元时间序列的异常检测问题。

Method: 创建时间序列变量分区，通过对变量间多个相关系数聚类确定变量子集，再对各子集局部执行异常检测算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实验表明该方法显著提升异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法在多元时间序列异常检测中具有相关性和有效性。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: 研究在生物分类任务中重新审视机器学习双下降现象，发现双下降需沿两个轴同时增加复杂度才出现，强调分析泛化行为时应将模型复杂度视为多维结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典学习理论有U型关系，近年有双下降现象，本文从经典机器学习视角，在生物分类任务中重新审视该现象。

Method: 在生物分类任务中，沿学习者容量和集成规模两个正交轴系统改变模型复杂度。

Result: 双下降仅在两轴复杂度同时增加时出现，单轴固定时泛化行为回归经典U或L型模式，结果在合成基准上得到复制。

Conclusion: 分析泛化行为时应将模型复杂度视为多维结构。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Motivation: 解决概率图模型中最可能解释（MPE）推理这一本质上难以处理的问题。

Method: 训练神经网络对变量值分配进行评分，开发可扩展数据生成管道提取训练信号，训练后的网络作为启发式方法与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在涉及高树宽PGMs的具有挑战性的MPE查询上进行评估，学习的启发式方法显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或提高解决方案质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架能有效加速MPE推理，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 研究DES - Clustering方法用于多类计算机视觉任务，实现针对嵌入式系统限制优化的TinyDES - Clustering库。

Result: 更大的动态选择分类器池能提高分类准确率，导致TinyML设备平均推理时间增加。

Conclusion: DES - Clustering方法可调整分类准确率，影响推理的延迟和能耗，在TinyML系统中有应用价值，但准确率提升与推理时间存在权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Conclusion: 该框架有创新点，适用于复杂流估计，未来有望用于完整城市估计和结合天气输入。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列并行方法Ring Attention通信效率低，其采用的Ring AllGather通信原语与现代加速器AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，限制了实际应用。

Method: 受完全有向图哈密顿分解启发，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统及单节点AMD MI300X系统上实验，TASP比Ring Attention通信效率更高，比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag - Ring Attention速度提升达3.58倍。

Conclusion: TASP方法能充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，提高通信效率，代码开源。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

Motivation: 线性注意力难以捕捉长距离模式，现有变体存在表达瓶颈。

Result: 在语言建模和高召回评估中，RLA 和 RDN 始终优于基线和其他现代线性注意力方法。

Conclusion: RLA 和 RDN 缩小了与标准 Transformer 的差距，同时保持线性缩放。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

Conclusion: RainfallBench和BFPF模块可有效用于降雨临近预报，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Result: 在昇腾910 NPUs上达到614 TFLOPS，达理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA。

Conclusion: AMLA表现出色，已集成到华为CANN并即将发布。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中具有鲁棒性和高效性

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Result: 大步长下参数空间有分形结构，近临界步长时所选极小值对初始化敏感，正则化会放大这种敏感性，产生收敛和发散初始化间的分形边界。

Conclusion: 近临界步长使梯度下降进入混沌状态，长期动态不可预测，无简单隐式偏差。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Conclusion: 所提框架具有优越的预测准确性、鲁棒性和自动化程度。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Conclusion: RPFs在理论和实践上均有效，为生成建模提供了强大基线，搭建了随机投影理论和归一化流之间的桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出半离散流匹配（SD - FM）方法，解决OT - FM的计算瓶颈，在多方面表现优于FM和OT - FM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT - FM理论有前景但实践中因计算成本高未广泛使用，为实现其理论优势而研究。

Method: 采用半离散公式，用SGD估计对偶势向量，通过最大内积搜索匹配噪声向量和数据点。

Result: SD - FM消除了OT - FM中对n/ε的二次依赖，在多个数据集、无条件/条件生成及使用平均流模型时，在所有训练指标和推理预算约束方面都优于FM和OT - FM。

Conclusion: SD - FM是一种更优的流匹配方法，能有效解决OT - FM的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Result: 在有解析测地线的合成流形和细胞插值上证明了策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提学习度量张量的策略能改进流匹配，在相关任务中有良好效果。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

TL;DR: 在需大量人机交互的语言任务中，为降低推理成本同时保证响应质量，用因果推理框架训练大语言模型路由器，实验表明该方法能实现更准确路由并改善成本与质量的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型路由器训练中，可靠监督数据稀缺，黄金标准数据成本高难扩展，基于偏好的数据有偏差，需解决这些问题以降低推理成本并保证响应质量。

Method: 将结合黄金标准和基于偏好数据的大语言模型路由器训练问题转化为因果推理框架，开发整合因果路由器训练框架来纠正偏好数据偏差、解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 数值实验显示该方法实现了更准确的路由，改善了成本和质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的因果推理框架及训练方法能有效解决大语言模型路由器训练中的数据问题，提高路由的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于小波的差分Transformer模型WDformer用于时间序列预测，利用小波变换和差分注意力机制，在多数据集达SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据稀疏，时域或频域单独建模受限，传统注意力机制聚焦无关历史信息引入噪声。

Method: 采用小波变换对时间序列数据多分辨率分析，利用时频域联合表示优势；应用倒置维度注意力机制；引入差分注意力机制计算注意力得分。

Result: WDformer在多个具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上取得了最先进（SOTA）的结果。

Conclusion: WDformer模型准确有效，可用于时间序列预测。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决未归一化目标密度的采样问题。

Method: 采用两阶段范式，初始化高斯组件并从提议混合中采样，通过基于样本的KL散度目标优化组件权重、均值和方差，再进行分层重采样。

Result: 在温和条件下，优化 - 重采样方案产生一致近似，实证结果显示在不同密度下准确且快速。

Conclusion: GMA采样器家族是一种无梯度、计算高效的采样方法，能产生符合目标的样本。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网中因高数据和设备异质性面临挑战，需解决这些问题。

Method: 提出FedCLF，在参与者选择过程引入校准损失作为效用，并使用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率。

Result: 使用CIFAR - 10数据集评估，FedCLF在高数据异质性场景下比基线模型性能最多提升16%，且通过降低采样频率提高了效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF能增强高异质性数据下的模型准确性，优化资源受限车联网的资源利用，提高联邦学习过程的效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在概率神经网络验证的中高维输入问题上具有有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain

methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed

a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA

<details>

Motivation: 现有智能体训练管道未让模型接触现实中常见的工具故障情况，导致工具增强语言智能体在现实部署中常因工具故障失败。

Method: 在增强的ToolBench数据集上通过系统故障注入和专家演示构建50000+恢复注释轨迹进行训练，使用基于LoRA的微调；推理时检测执行错误，从55+故障示例库中检索最相似案例并执行对应恢复动作。

Result: 该方法能泛化到训练分布之外的新故障，在未见工具API上保留95.2%恢复性能；在多项评估指标上有显著提升，如RR从32.76%提升到89.68%。

Conclusion: PALADIN是在现实工具环境中构建具备强大恢复能力的容错智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实验表明该方法与基线策略相比实现了良好的生成质量权衡；理论上证明算法达到最优后悔界$O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$。

Conclusion: 所提算法为具有扩展动作空间的在线学习提供了首个次线性后悔界。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action

Conclusion: HAMMER方法能有效解决现有方法的问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑、有效视野短时最有效，操作动作抽象空间很重要，RA3算法有效。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略有潜力弥合通用大语言模型与特定领域应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 将特征几何融入现有蒸馏方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Conclusion: 所提出的联合优化框架和新的MADRL算法能有效解决无人机辅助移动众包感知中的协调问题，提升数据处理量。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该工作为大语言模型的高效部署提供了系统、自适应的框架，推动了轻量级优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

Result: 通过实验证明InfMasking能有效增强模态间协同信息，在大规模真实数据集的七个基准测试中取得SOTA性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking方法能有效解决现有多模态表示学习方法在捕捉协同信息方面的问题。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，能有效识别最小且可行的改变。

Conclusion: ACE算法在生成反事实解释时既高效又有效。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is

Conclusion: ClustRecNet框架在聚类算法推荐方面表现出色，能有效解决聚类算法选择问题。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model

data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的生成过采样对复杂非线性结构领域的不平衡学习有价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

TL;DR: 介绍了用于竞争风险下离散时间生存分析的FCRN框架，在多数据集上表现优于传统模型，推动重症监护预后建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一个能无缝集成功能协变量、处理缺失数据的竞争风险下离散时间生存分析统一深度学习框架。

Method: 结合用于功能数据表示的微网络基础层和基于梯度的插补模块，同时学习插补缺失值和预测特定事件风险。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集和真实世界ICU案例研究中，FCRN在预测准确性上比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推动了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

TL;DR: 研究基于GW150914引力波数据训练的VAE - MoG模型，发现强去噪性能不意味着潜在表示可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基于GW150914引力波数据训练的VAE - MoG模型潜在空间，评估其对潜在结构的捕捉能力。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡罗（HMC）方法基于干净输入绘制后验样本，并与编码器对噪声数据的输出进行比较。

Result: 模型能准确重建信号，但潜在空间存在明显不匹配。

Conclusion: 强去噪性能不意味着潜在表示可靠，评估生成模型时应使用基于后验的验证。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 找到一种能在真实数据结构未知时有效聚合多模型聚类算法预测结果的方法。

Method: 将Dawid - Skene模型改进以聚合多模型聚类算法的预测，把聚类算法输出建模为噪声注释。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集实验表明，Mixsemble不总是表现最佳，但稳定接近最优结果，避免糟糕结果。

Conclusion: Mixsemble的稳健性使其在真实数据结构未知时，成为实用选择，尤其适合非专家用户。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方程发现中模型在不同操作条件下的泛化问题，避免过拟合特定数据集。

Method: 在多任务学习框架中应用贝叶斯相关向量机（RVM），对同一结构不同激励水平下的响应作为相关任务进行参数识别。

Result: 单任务RVM在激励不足时难以恢复真实控制项，MTL - RVM能结合多任务信息，在不同激励数据集下提升参数恢复能力。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推理可减轻过拟合，促进方程发现中的泛化，对结构健康监测有重要意义。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视多LoRA中A矩阵相似现象，提出ALoRA和Fed - ALoRA方法，实验表明其在多任务上性能更均衡且准确率相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究认为多LoRA中A矩阵相似可共享，但本文发现该相似性主要源于初始化相同，B在知识编码和传递中更关键，因此提出新方法。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多任务微调中多A矩阵和单共享B的非对称多LoRA设计）和Fed - ALoRA（通过新矩阵分解策略在联邦微调中跨客户端共享B）。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上实验，方法在各任务上性能更均衡，平均准确率与现有多LoRA方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 所提ALoRA和Fed - ALoRA方法在多任务和联邦微调场景中有效，能提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

TL;DR: 提出针对TGNNs的新型受限黑盒攻击框架HIA，实验表明其能显著降低TGNNs在链接预测任务上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对时空动态图的攻击方法存在局限性，TGNNs对抗攻击的鲁棒性是重要挑战。

Method: 利用数据驱动的替代模型识别重要节点，采用混合扰动策略，结合战略边注入和目标边删除，同时最小化扰动数量以增强隐蔽性。

Result: 在五个真实数据集和四个代表性TGNN架构上实验，HIA使TGNN在链接预测任务上的MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 当前STDG模型存在根本漏洞，急需考虑结构和时间动态的强大防御机制。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出多色目标以解决强化学习微调中策略多样性丢失问题，在多任务实验中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调时策略易丢失多样性，收敛到少数可利用输出，阻碍探索，影响预训练策略能力扩展和测试时计算扩展的收益。

Method: 引入多色目标，采用藤蔓采样收集策略滚动数据，修改优势函数以适应新目标。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和算法创造力实验中，提高了成功率，能解决更多环境配置问题，在大扰动下泛化性更好，在pass@$k$实验中覆盖率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效维护和利用多样化策略，提升预训练策略性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出学习进度监控（LPM）方法用于内在激励探索，理论分析其特性并通过实验验证优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于内在奖励的探索方法在有不可学习随机源的环境中存在易卡住、样本效率低和计算成本高的问题，受神经科学启发提出新方法。

Method: 提出LPM方法，奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性，采用双网络设计，用误差模型预测动力学模型之前迭代的预期预测误差，用当前和之前迭代的模型误差差引导探索。

Result: LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari游戏中获得更高外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM是一种概念简单且标志着抗噪声探索范式转变的方法。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

Method: 引入专门为时间序列表示学习调整的Time Series JEPA (TS - JEPA)架构。

Result: 在分类和预测任务验证，能匹配或超越不同标准数据集上的当前最优基线，在不同任务上表现平衡。

Conclusion: 为基于联合嵌入的未来时间序列基础模型开发奠定基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Conclusion: 所提框架显著提升任务成功率，数据效率高，在模拟和真实机器人上表现良好。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非一致性分数，将平滑CP层嵌入训练，采用新损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上减少预测不确定性、提高准确性，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 所提端到端可微CP框架能增强STL推理的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: P2Es在12导联心电图重建中优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es框架在从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联心电图方面表现良好。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Motivation: 分子基础模型在OOD样本上不可靠，化学幻觉问题限制其在高风险领域应用。

Method: 将OOD检测问题转化为对分布内（ID）和OOD样本估计的OOD亲和力的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，该目标本质上优化AUROC。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集的实验中，显著提升现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在大小、支架和测定分布偏移下，AUROC分别最多提升45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole - PAIR模块能通过经济有效的训练后处理，提升现有基础模型在OOD数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在解决科学逆设计问题时虽有机会但也有风险，探索低质量区域会消耗资源且可能导致模型衰退。

Method: 提出结合生成建模和主动学习的队列优先级算法，在分布式工作流中探索复杂设计空间。

Result: 在现有的用于发现碳捕获新型分子结构候选者的生成式AI工作流中，有主动学习的方法平均能生成604个高性能候选者，而无主动学习的方法平均生成281个。

Conclusion: 纳入主动学习模型对顶级设计候选者进行优先级排序，可防止生成式AI工作流在无意义候选者上浪费资源，避免生成模型衰退，有效提高高质量候选者数量。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

TL;DR: 提出FedIF框架应对联邦学习鲁棒性挑战，降低计算开销，实验证明其有效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习因非IID数据分布和恶意客户端行为面临鲁棒性挑战，现有基于Shapley值的方法计算开销大，可扩展性受限。

Method: 提出FedIF框架，利用基于轨迹的影响估计计算客户端贡献，引入归一化和平滑影响分数。

Result: 理论分析表明FedIF在噪声条件下对全局损失变化有更严格的边界；实验显示FedIF在多种噪声存在时鲁棒性不低于基于SV的方法，减少聚合开销达450倍；消融实验证实其设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: FedIF是基于Shapley值方法的实用、理论可靠且可扩展的替代方案，适用于现实世界部署。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升ICRL适应过程的安全性，使智能体在无参数更新的适应过程中兼顾奖励最大化和成本函数最小化。

Method: 在受限马尔可夫决策过程框架下提出新方法。

Result: 智能体能够对成本容忍阈值做出反应，成本预算高时行为更激进，预算低时更保守。

Conclusion: 所提方法可促进ICRL适应过程的安全性。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典无导数方法在高维、有噪声或混合整数设置中存在困难，需要新方法增强黑盒优化。

Method: 对使用机器学习和强化学习增强黑盒优化的发展进行调查，介绍代表性算法和基准测试工作。

Result: 梳理了一系列代表性算法，如mlrMBO、ZO - AdaMM等，以及基准测试如NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge和MetaBox框架。

Conclusion: 机器学习和强化学习将经典不精确求解器转变为更适用于现实世界优化的可扩展、鲁棒和自适应框架。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

TL;DR: 提出使用二元稀疏自编码器(BAEs)和二元转码器(BTCs)解决SAEs特征在低激活强度下难解释问题，研究发现二值化提升特征可解释性但增加重建误差，频率调整后连续稀疏编码器表现略好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多稀疏自编码器(SAEs)特征仅在高激活强度下可解释，需解决低激活强度下的可解释性问题。

Method: 提出使用二元稀疏自编码器(BAEs)和二元转码器(BTCs)，将所有激活约束为0或1。

Result: 二值化显著提高发现特征的可解释性和单语义性，但增加重建误差，也增加了不可解释的超高频率特征数量，频率调整后连续稀疏编码器可解释性得分略好。

Conclusion: 多语义性可能是神经激活不可消除的属性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

TL;DR: 介绍有效模型剪枝（EMP）方法，它提供通用自适应阈值，能用于多种剪枝标准，实验表明可生成性能与原密集网络相当的稀疏模型，且给出保留质量下界，验证了N_eff有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决剪枝中保留多少条目的基本问题。

Method: 引入EMP，将得分向量映射到内置有效数N_eff，保留N_eff个最高分条目，利用单纯形几何推导保留质量下界，用缩放阈值eta*N_eff进行剪枝验证。

Result: 生成的稀疏模型在多种模型中性能与原密集网络相当，默认eta = 1是稳健的剪枝阈值，eta不等于1可按需调整。

Conclusion: EMP是一种有效的模型剪枝方法，能为多种剪枝标准提供通用自适应阈值。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保电网弹性需要对同步相量数据流进行及时且无监督的异常检测。

Method: 引入T - BiGAN框架，将窗口注意力Transformer集成到双向生成对抗网络（BiGAN）中，利用自注意力编解码器捕捉时空依赖，联合判别器保证循环一致性，用自适应分数实时标记异常。

Result: 在硬件在环PMU基准测试中，ROC - AUC达到0.95，平均精度达到0.996，显著优于领先的有监督和无监督方法。

Conclusion: T - BiGAN在检测细微的频率和电压偏差方面表现出色，无需手动标记故障数据，对实时广域监测有实际价值。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

TL;DR: 本文提出D - Rank框架用于大语言模型压缩，实验表明其在不同压缩率下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SVD的大语言模型压缩方法采用统一压缩率，忽略了层内异质性，带来了局限性。

Method: 引入有效秩作为度量矩阵信息密度的指标，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案分配秩，平衡注意力层的秩分配，并将D - Rank扩展到具有分组查询注意力的最新大语言模型。

Result: 在多个压缩率下的不同规模大语言模型上实验，D - Rank始终优于SVD - LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing等方法，如在C4数据集上，LLaMA - 3 - 8B模型在20%压缩率下困惑度降低超15，LLaMA - 7B模型在40%压缩率下零样本推理准确率提高达5%，且吞吐量更高。

Conclusion: D - Rank是一种有效的大语言模型压缩框架，能在压缩模型的同时提升性能和吞吐量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

Method: 引入单步一致性模型Swift，首次实现用连续排序概率分数目标对概率流模型进行自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动。

Result: Swift能生成每6小时一次、长达75天保持稳定的预报，比现有扩散模型基线快39倍，预报技巧与基于数值的业务IFS ENS相当。

Conclusion: 该研究向中到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件化在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险收敛，但对期望风险的作用研究不足，需探究其对特征学习和泛化性能的影响。

Method: 先表明模型输入信息通过预条件器度量定义的Gram矩阵传递，诱导特征学习的谱偏差；以输入协方差矩阵的p次幂为预条件器，在单指数教师模型中证明p和教师与输入谱的对齐是泛化的关键因素；从抗噪性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移三个角度研究因素间相互作用对特征学习的影响。

Result: 学习到的特征表示反映预条件器引入的谱偏差，当谱偏差与教师模型的谱偏差对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件化引入的谱偏差与教师模型谱偏差对齐可显著增强泛化性能。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

Method: 提出UQ - SONet，集成集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏和可变传感器位置，用条件变分自编码器近似解算子条件分布，最小化负ELBO。

Result: 在确定性和随机PDEs（包括Navier - Stokes方程）的数值实验中，UQ - SONet表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ - SONet能有效处理传感器约束问题，提供有原则的不确定性估计，保持预测准确性。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet实验中，PWMPR性能接近IMP衍生彩票，成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是有前途的范式，可补充剪枝和动态稀疏性。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有在线强化学习算法如GRPO在大语言模型推理中无法从‘不可解’问题学习，模型‘上限’无法改变的问题。

Method: 提出NuRL方法，利用自生成提示降低问题难度，根据通过率决定是否注入提示，对0通过率的难题注入提示并重新生成轨迹。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上取得一致改进，能提升模型上限，而GRPO的pass@1024与基础模型无变化。

Conclusion: NuRL可突破模型推理上限，有效提示抽象且高层，在必要时及GRPO收敛后应用最有益。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效改善字典学习效果，减少字典原子使用，有较好的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Result: 时间序列问答模型能基于伪标签成功训练，且利用大量未标注数据后性能超越视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签的训练方法对时间序列问答任务有效。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Motivation: 随着真实世界图规模增大，直接处理困难且不可行，定制算法处理大规模数据可能牺牲性能，因此考虑图缩减减少训练数据量。

Conclusion: 所提方法无需将粗化作为预处理步骤，节点簇能适应学习任务，适用于其他方法处理困难的场景，如异质数据。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

Method: Expert Merging用无标签校准数据学习少量层系数，优化系数使合并模型隐藏状态和对数似然与专家模型对齐；Expert Merging++用重要性引导分块增强，分配更多系数给重要层。

Result: 在MLLM和LLM骨干上超越强无训练和基于训练的合并基线，Expert Merging++有进一步提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是无标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方法。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

Motivation: 标准流匹配方法应用于长尾分布时存在多数偏差，生成少数模式保真度低且无法匹配真实类别比例。

Method: 用小批量不平衡最优传输（UOT）构建条件向量场，通过无类别标签的多数得分进行原则性逆重加权策略减轻多数偏差，并将该得分纳入训练目标。

Conclusion: UOT - RFM是一种有效处理类别不平衡（长尾）分布的生成建模框架。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Method: 提出Multi - Path Causal Optimization (MuPlon)框架，集成后门路径和前门路径的双重因果干预策略。

Result: MuPlon实验表现优于现有方法，达到了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon框架有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏差问题，是一种更优的声明验证方法。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also

using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations.
We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE

antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RCU方法能有效解决现有方法困境，在无保留数据集情况下表现出色。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: 现有PPO - based RLHF训练管道因顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度存在效率问题。

Method: 引入两种新技术：Intra - step overlap（以合适大小块流式传输上游模型输出，使下游模型提前预填充）和Inter - step overlap（自适应过度提交提示并将长生成推迟到未来步骤），且易于与现有PPO实现集成。

Result: OPPO将基于PPO的RLHF训练加速1.8 - 2.8倍，将GPU利用率提高1.4 - 2.1倍。

Conclusion: OPPO在不影响训练收敛的情况下提高了PPO - based RLHF的训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost

available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

Motivation: 现有代表性算法GRPO存在消失优势问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse Policy Optimization (AR3PO)算法，引入自适应滚动和响应重用两种新技术。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO始终优于GRPO，与或超过DAPO，最多降低4.2倍滚动成本；在32B模型上，与DAPO性能相当但滚动成本低。

Conclusion: AR3PO是一种采样高效的RLVR算法，能有效解决GRPO问题并降低成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Method: 提出Kairos框架，集成动态补丁标记器和实例自适应位置嵌入，在PreSTS语料库上训练，推理阶段采用多补丁预测策略。

Result: Kairos在GIFT - Eval和Time - Series - Library两个零样本基准测试中，以更少参数实现了卓越性能，始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos框架能有效克服现有TSFMs的局限性，在零样本时间序列分析中表现良好。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Motivation: 多模态模型常过度依赖主导模态，现有工作多关注训练目标或优化过程，数据中心解决方案待探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS策略生成模态信息语义不一致的未对齐样本，用单模态置信度评分标注；引入弱模态加权和难样本加权。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试中，MIDAS显著优于相关基线。

Conclusion: MIDAS能有效解决多模态模型的模态失衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

Conclusion: CSD对于大语言模型蒸馏具有可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Conclusion: S²FS框架是一种有效的特征选择方法，能提升模糊决策系统的性能和所选特征的可解释性。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Conclusion: 该方法可从学习饱和的任务重新分配探索预算，以较少计算资源取得与传统均匀分配相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Conclusion: 强化学习引导的数据选择方法有很大潜力。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

Conclusion: 迭代级探索是加强策略强化学习的实用有效方法，为替代目标的局限性提供新视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

Motivation: 解决Federated Learning采用differential privacy时，添加噪声大幅降低模型精度的问题。

Conclusion: MS - PAFL能实现更好的隐私 - 效用权衡，可在强隐私保证下训练高精度模型。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Conclusion: 研究了DLGNs在大规模分类（最多2000类）中的应用。

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升平滑多数投票分类器的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Conclusion: 提出的改进算法在多个领域具有应用价值，QSBP与经典随机动力学存在差异，反映量子系统特征。

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Result: 在困惑度和零样本准确率上显著优于现有方法，在LLaMA2 - 7B上用少量训练资源有不错表现，建立了准确的经验缩放定律。

Conclusion: CAST框架有效，所建稀疏模型有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能够有效应对上下文不对齐的情况，提升注意力机制在复杂场景中的效能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

Motivation: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam快，但成功机制不明，需进行探究。

Method: 通过消融Transformer组件、分析一层联想记忆模型，结合实证和理论分析。

Result: 发现联想记忆参数是Muon优越的主要贡献因素；Muon更新规则奇异谱更各向同性，在重尾数据上对尾类优化更有效；理论证明Muon能实现跨类平衡学习，Adam会因嵌入属性产生学习误差差异。

Conclusion: Muon更新规则符合线性联想记忆的外积结构，在重尾分布中学习尾类比Adam更平衡有效。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Result: DPSBA有效抑制结构和语义异常，攻击成功率高且隐蔽性显著提升。

Conclusion: 在真实数据集上实验表明，DPSBA与现有方法相比，在有效性和可检测性间实现了更优平衡。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 先前时间域泛化方法预测全模型权重成本高，仅预测分类器层无法调整其他组件，限制泛化能力。

Method: 提出TEA框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型。分两步增强对未来域的泛化：一是微调领域无关基础模型创建专家模型；二是在主成分子空间建模时间权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差 - 方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准、5个模型和2个TDG设置上的实验表明，TEA比先前TDG方法性能提升高达69%，效率提高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA是一种新颖且可扩展的TDG框架，能在最大化泛化潜力的同时最小化计算成本。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Conclusion: 裁剪机制可用于控制熵，更激进的clip - low值能增加熵、促进探索并防止熵坍缩。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Result: AAD在不同对齐基准和模型规模上始终优于强基线，在数据受限情况下能生成高质量合成数据。

Conclusion: AAD是一种有效提升大语言模型对齐的方法，在数据受限场景也有实用价值。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Conclusion: 严格局部性和可学习时间步长为神经PDE求解器提供准确可扩展基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

TL;DR: 提出Marginal Flow框架克服现有电流密度建模方法的缺点，能精确评估密度，训练和推理更快且灵活，在多任务上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电流密度建模方法存在训练成本高、推理慢、似然近似、模式崩溃或架构约束等缺点，需要改进。

Method: 通过带潜在参数w的参数分布q(x|w)定义模型q_θ(x)，从可学习分布q_θ(w)采样w并边缘化，实现高效评估和采样。

Result: 所提模型能精确评估密度，训练和推理比竞争模型快几个数量级，且灵活，能处理多模态目标。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow框架有效，在多种任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

Motivation: RLVR训练时需要极长上下文长度，计算成本高，多阶段训练无法显著降低整体训练计算量。

Method: 引入TFPI，通过简单的*ThinkFree*操作显式丢弃思考内容，用*ThinkFree*调整后的输入进行训练。

Result: TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到更高性能上限，产生了更节省token的推理模型，仅用TFPI训练的4B模型在多个基准测试上取得良好成绩。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR改进方法，无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Motivation: 传统计算dQ/dV方法易放大噪声和引入偏差，需更好的锂电镀检测方法。

Method: 提出高斯过程框架，直接建模Q(V)，利用GP导数性质解析和概率性推断dQ/dV。

Result: 在不同C率和温度下实验表明能可靠检测电镀峰，无电镀时正确报告无峰。

Conclusion: 该方法准确鲁棒，为实时锂电镀检测提供实用途径。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

Motivation: 传统安全监测器对每个查询计算量固定，存在资源浪费或漏检问题，需要灵活的安全监测器。

Method: 引入截断多项式分类器（TPCs），可逐步训练和评估多项式，提供安全调节和自适应级联两种使用模式。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集上，TPCs与相同大小的基于MLP的探测基线竞争或表现更优，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs是一种有效的动态激活监测方法，可灵活调整成本，具有良好性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能确保在设计含经验分布和估计因果结构的DRO时实现高效和鲁棒学习。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Conclusion: 随机插值器可作为物理仿真的有竞争力基线，为不同生成建模框架能力提供见解。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: AGD是提升现代大语言模型可靠性的通用、更具可解释性和有效的方法。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

TL;DR: 提出广义信息瓶颈（GIB）框架，解决原信息瓶颈（IB）原理的局限，实验显示GIB有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原IB原理存在理论模糊和估计挑战，其实用性受限。

Method: 从协同角度重新表述IB原理，用基于平均交互信息的协同可计算定义重新构建IB。

Result: GIB在多种架构中都有压缩阶段，在CNN和Transformer中有可解释动态，更符合对抗鲁棒性理解。

Conclusion: GIB解决了原IB的局限，与现有IB理论兼容且更具优势。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Result: 实验表明FedMuon能超过现有最先进的联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedMuon是一种有效的联邦学习方法，可解决Muon应用于联邦学习的收敛问题并提高性能。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Conclusion: 内存驱动的自我改进框架能有效解决大语言模型在特定顺序决策任务中的适配问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Result: 说明了不同场景间的预测差距以及对分诊最关键的特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可及性，推动临床AI数据集民主化。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Method: 提供理论和实证证据，以逻辑回归为例分析，通过简单示例说明，并用复杂神经网络实验验证。

Conclusion: 数据集中统计依赖关系的存在足以导致基于上升的遗忘方法失败，该问题在实践中未得到解决。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

Motivation: 传统半自回归解码使用固定块大小存在后期解码开销和过早解码错误的问题，需要改进。

Method: 通过对去噪过程中置信度动态的统计分析，确定波动带区域以指导自适应块大小调整，提出无训练、即插即用的AdaBlock - dLLM调度器。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，AdaBlock - dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下精度提升达5.3%。

Conclusion: 语义感知自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析有望启发dLLM未来的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

Motivation: 现有决策树局限于结构化表格数据，大语言模型提示策略难以确保可信行为，需要一种能处理非结构化输入且决策透明可解释的方法。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT达到或超过基于提示的基线。

Conclusion: ACT能将决策树方法扩展到非结构化输入，同时产生透明和可解释的决策路径。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

Motivation: 原Robbins - Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，在许多强化学习应用中该条件无法满足，因此要扩展定理。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新的温和假设，结合零阶项平方可和条件。

Result: 实现了几乎必然收敛到有界集，给出几乎必然收敛率、高概率集中界和$L^p$收敛率，应用于随机近似和强化学习，得到$Q$学习的相关收敛结果。

Conclusion: 成功扩展Robbins - Siegmund定理并应用于重要领域，获得新的收敛结果。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

Result: 报告了各种预训练、统计和基线模型在fev - bench上的结果。

Conclusion: 确定了未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有向量量化的硬分配阻碍梯度流动和端到端训练。

Method: 提出DiVeQ，将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；提出SF - DiVeQ，分配到连接码字的曲线，且两种方法无需辅助损失或温度调度即可端到端训练。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF - DiVeQ优于其他量化方法。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

Motivation: 大推理模型存在过度思考导致token浪费问题，需检测并防止过度思考。

Method: 提出Entropy After </Think> (EAT)信号，通过附加停止思考标记并监测后续标记熵，对其指数移动平均方差阈值处理得到停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025上，EAT减少13 - 21%的token使用，在黑盒设置中仍有效。

Conclusion: EAT能有效监测和防止大推理模型过度思考，可更高效分配计算资源。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

Result: 通过大量实验，证明所提算法在多种数据集和任务上比众多基线方法更有效。

Conclusion: TAP算法能有效解决基础模型在异构场景下的微调与个性化问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Motivation: 关键基础设施日益复杂且依赖度增加，电网成为网络攻击目标，不稳定攻击防护较少。

Method: 采用数据驱动方法训练监督式机器学习模型，使用改进Prony分析（MPA）。

Result: 在IEEE 14总线系统上进行概念验证，证明MPA可检测不稳定攻击并触发防御机制。

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效为电网负荷削减决策系统增加抵御不稳定攻击的能力。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Result: 在合成多任务问题中按理论分离输入；应用于Inception - v1时，核结构与WordNet语义层次一致。

Conclusion: 损失核是用于可解释性和数据归因的实用工具。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar

strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模（CRM）解决现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）问题，实验表明CRM优于现有奖励模型，增强大语言模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs存在无法捕捉步骤间依赖、难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐等问题，导致奖励信号存在因果问题和信用分配模糊，使下游模型易受奖励破解影响且性能不佳。

Method: 提出CRM，将大语言模型推理视为通向正确答案的时间过程，每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于先前步骤，还与推理轨迹的最终结果明确关联，通过强制条件概率规则捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best - of - N采样、束搜索和强化学习等实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型。

Conclusion: CRM为增强大语言模型推理提供了一个有原则的框架，对奖励破解更具鲁棒性，无需依赖真实数据的可验证奖励就能实现下游稳定改进。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型为人类生成图像描述时会遗漏推理系统所需的精确细节，导致接口不匹配，影响推理效果。

Method: 提出Adaptive - Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC - RL)方法，通过交互让视觉模型了解推理器所需信息，惩罚需要澄清的成功结果以促使生成全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中，相比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，若允许澄清请求可减少39%。

Conclusion: 将澄清作为一种隐式监督，表明视觉语言接口可仅通过交互有效学习，无需显式注释。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Method: 引入基于合适评分规则（如CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次得分）的统一UQ框架，推导闭式表达式，用模型集成估计不确定性度量。

Result: 不确定性度量自然分解为随机和认知分量，框架涵盖基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量。

Conclusion: 对合成和真实世界回归数据集的广泛评估，为选择可靠UQ度量提供了指导。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Conclusion: 为从语言预训练中有意识培养视觉先验提供新方法，为下一代多模态大模型发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: RSA方法有效，结合聚合感知强化学习训练可带来显著性能增益。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Conclusion: AttnRL框架能有效提升推理模型的探索效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Conclusion: AccidentBench可暴露模型关键差距，推动更安全、鲁棒且契合现实安全挑战的多模态模型发展。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

Motivation: AI易受数据扰动和对抗样本影响，评估模型需访问数据集会威胁数据隐私，需在不披露隐私数据情况下实现外部验证。

Method: 提出Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA)方法，将表格数据集转换为领域无关的统计模式表示，计算数据实例投影到离散空间。

Result: 投影后的数据集可用于评估不同特征对ML模型鲁棒性的影响，生成可解释的行为解释。

Conclusion: SPATA方法有助于在不泄露数据隐私的情况下评估ML模型，促进更可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Method: 引入Hopfield - Resnet架构，在Hopfield网络中结合残差连接和clipped ReLU激活函数。

Result: Hopfield - Resnet可训练近两倍于先前工作的层数，如Hopfield - Resnet13在CIFAR - 10上达93.92%精度，比之前最佳结果高约3.5%。

Conclusion: Hopfield - Resnet架构有效提升了平衡传播算法训练网络的性能，精度与反向传播训练的Resnet13相当。

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible
alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient
computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium
states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic
hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been
restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small
architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer.
These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized
feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce
the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip)
connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation
function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of
networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For
example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is
$\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that
provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

Conclusion: BDH是实用、高性能且具有可解释性的架构，为人类神经元实现言语提供可能机制。

Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as
motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.
Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful
properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for
Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model
architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$
locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical
foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like
performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space
sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits
a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:
empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at
the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during
inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using
spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses
strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept
while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a
graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model
is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human
neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse
and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.
Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and
model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

productivity. This paper introduces WARP (Web-Augmented Real-time Program
Repairer), a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and
dynamic web-augmented synthesis for real-time resolution of these errors. WARP
actively monitors developer terminals, intelligently detects compilation
errors, and synergistically combines the understanding of a fine-tuned Code-LLM
with relevant solutions, explanations, and code snippets retrieved from
up-to-date web sources like developer forums and official documentation.
Experimental results on our curated benchmark, CGP (featuring C/C++, Python,
and Go errors), demonstrate WARP achieves a superior fix rate (72.5 % Compiles
correctly) and higher semantic correctness compared to baseline LLM-only
approaches and traditional IDE quick-fixes. Key technical challenges in
achieving high-accuracy synthesis from noisy web data.

<details>

Motivation: 利用基础模型的能力进行软件开发，特别是针对PDE数值库的代码开发，而现有研究主要聚焦终端用户的案例设置和执行，缺乏针对二次开发者的代码开发自动化。

Method: 引入零样本、多智能体LLM框架LLM - PDEveloper，采用端到端的数学到代码转换方法生成和适配PDE库的代码。

Result: 在三项任务上取得一定成功率，分析了LLM语法错误导致的失败并提出有效修复方法，还识别了某些语义错误的机制。

Conclusion: LLM - PDEveloper为PDE库的代码开发提供了自动化解决方案，分析错误有助于未来研究。

Abstract: Foundation models -- large language models (LLMs) in particular -- have
become ubiquitous, shaping daily life and driving breakthroughs across science,
engineering, and technology. Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge,
text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g.,
numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is
therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate
case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a
zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE
libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating
mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code,
LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This
end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that
continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and
broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a
solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an
existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success
rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we
propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain
semantic errors, guiding future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于机器学习系统的不确定性，为及时检测不良行为、避免组织遭受损失，有必要从从业者角度研究其监控情况。

Method: 对91位机器学习从业者进行全球调查，开展定性和定量分析。

Result: 从业者常面临模型性能下降、延迟超标和安全违规等运行时问题；多数倾向自动化监控，但因复杂性等仍依赖手动方法；监控工具初始设置复杂，增加额外工作和资源负担。从业者期望自动生成和部署监控器等改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更符合从业者需求的机器学习监控工具提供指导。

Abstract: Given the inherent non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML) systems,
their behavior in production environments can lead to unforeseen and
potentially dangerous outcomes. For a timely detection of unwanted behavior and
to prevent organizations from financial and reputational damage, monitoring
these systems is essential. This paper explores the strategies, challenges, and
improvement opportunities for monitoring ML systems from the practitioners
perspective. We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect
diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to
complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses,
focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation
practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools.
Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues
related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security
violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased
efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack
of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial
setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and
challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert
thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload,
strains resources, and causes alert fatigue. The desired improvements from the
practitioners perspective are: automated generation and deployment of monitors,
improved support for performance and fairness monitoring, and recommendations
for resolving runtime issues. These insights offer valuable guidance for the
future development of ML monitoring tools that are better aligned with
practitioners needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 API 合成方法存在搜索空间大、成本高及 LLM 生成代码不准确等问题。

Method: 提出 APRIL 方法，结合 LLM 合成、自动提示优化（APO）和基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。

Result: 在 81 个真实世界 API 上评估，与专家提示指导的未微调 LLM 相比，APRIL 有显著改进。

Conclusion: 集成 APO 和 RLVR 为大型库中基于组件的 API 合成提供了稳健、可扩展的途径。

Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from
large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional
component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted
specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations
from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date
contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present
APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):
APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the
policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis
pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python
libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs
guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These
results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path
for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的方法忽视跨模块依赖和全局上下文，无法将自动形式验证扩展到现实项目，需要解决验证整个软件仓库的挑战。

Method: 引入RVBench基准，构建于四个不同复杂的开源Verus项目；提出RagVerus框架，结合检索增强生成和上下文感知提示。

Result: RagVerus在现有基准上使证明通过率提高两倍，在更具挑战性的RVBench基准上相对提升27%。

Conclusion: RagVerus是可扩展且样本高效的验证解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in
code and proof generations. However, scaling automated formal verification to
real-world projects requires resolving cross-module dependencies and global
contexts, which are crucial challenges overlooked by existing LLM-based methods
with a special focus on targeting isolated, function-level verification tasks.
To systematically explore and address the significant challenges of verifying
entire software repositories, we introduce RVBench, the first verification
benchmark explicitly designed for repository-level evaluation, constructed from
four diverse and complex open-source Verus projects.
  We further introduce RagVerus, an extensible framework that synergizes
retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to automate proof
synthesis for multi-module repositories. RagVerus triples proof pass rates on
existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves a
27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark,
demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提交的代码编辑任务数据集有噪声、缺乏多样性且不能反映真实编辑指令风格。

Method: 引入CanItEdit管道，利用多个大语言模型合成代码编辑三元组，生成不同类型指令，基于差异和主题过滤，构建OCEDataFT数据集，在该数据集上微调模型。

Result: 在CanItEdit基准测试上性能显著提升，相对pass@1提高4.50% - 20.79%，模型性能接近闭源系统，与GPT - 4差距缩小到3.54%。

Conclusion: 不依赖专有资源和手动注释，通过CanItEdit管道构建数据集微调模型可有效提升代码编辑任务性能。

Abstract: Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers
to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while
keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However,
commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack
diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To
address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages
multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces
both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and
applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and
variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K
samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to
significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1
improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models
achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4
to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问题定位基准如SWE - Bench和LocBench有局限性，主要关注拉取请求问题和代码位置，忽略其他证据和非代码文件。

Method: 引入包含46个流行GitHub Python项目的1100个问题的MULocBench数据集，用该基准评估最先进的定位方法和五种基于大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 当前技术有显著局限，即使在文件层面，性能指标（Acc@5, F1）仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 强调在现实多方面问题解决中泛化的挑战，公开MULocBench数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue
resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing
benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited.
They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring
other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations,
and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a
comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects.
Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in
issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more
realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based
prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current
techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain
below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic,
multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project
localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在结构化推理任务有困难，CoT提示冗长低效，CoD提示因随机性难选最优解。

Method: 提出MultiCoD强化学习框架，用策略引导提示鼓励多样推理风格，将解决方案选择建模为上下文多臂老虎机问题，通过奖励函数优化可解释特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验，MultiCoD优于或与基线相当，能降低用户账单超50%，提升LLM响应质量。

Conclusion: MultiCoD更具可持续性和可扩展性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with
structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps,
it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting
offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces
varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose
\multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most
promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses
strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models
solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes
interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and
strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency,
and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and
Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard
prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency
from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only
for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM
response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world
deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出RANGER代码检索代理，可处理代码实体和自然语言查询，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用自动化软件工程任务需要能处理代码实体查询和自然语言查询的代码检索系统，现有工作多关注代码实体查询，存在空白。

Method: 构建仓库知识图，通过双阶段检索管道处理查询，实体查询用Cypher查找，自然语言查询用MCTS引导图探索。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，RANGER在代码搜索、问答、跨文件依赖检索和代码补全等任务上优于基线。

Conclusion: RANGER能有效处理不同类型代码查询，在核心ASE任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: General-purpose automated software engineering (ASE) includes tasks such as
code completion, retrieval, repair, QA, and summarization. These tasks require
a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities,
or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving
the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit
code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and
retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code
retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent
works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a
tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,
capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,
and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the
gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph
through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered
through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by
MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse
benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question
answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code
completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that
use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves
superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval,
pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code
completion compared to other RAG methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代码生成虽提升开发者效率，但增加了次优解和不安全代码风险，需提升模型性能和生成代码可解释性。

Method: 对MBPP测试集输出进行基于抽象语法树（AST）的分析，识别受所选示例影响最大的代码区域。

Result: 高质量ICL示例使输出更易解释，对pass@10指标有积极性能提升；差的示例则产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 高效的ICL采样策略对模型在任何给定任务中的性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely
adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering,
speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code
generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and
Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and
recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the
growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although
these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing
reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of
suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically
sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model
performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using
AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of
code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show
that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret
but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric.
Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on
the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach
highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can
affect the performance of the model on any given task.

Motivation: 现有自动编译开源软件的方法依赖手动规则和工作流，无法适应定制配置或环境设置的OSS，且现有LLM评估不全面，低估了编译挑战。

Method: 提出BUILD - BENCH基准，包含质量、规模和特性更多样的OSS；提出基于LLM的代理OSS - BUILD - AGENT，有增强的构建指令检索模块。

Result: OSS - BUILD - AGENT在BUILD - BENCH上达到了最先进的性能，且能适应异构OSS特性。

Conclusion: BUILD - BENCH能如实反映代理处理编译这一复杂软件工程任务的能力，将推动软件开发和软件安全等下游应用的创新。

Abstract: Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital,
labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM
Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which
cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment
setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective
evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the
realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions
are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even
require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more
challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more
diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with
enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS
characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different
compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task,
offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on
BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as
a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur
innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields
of software development and software security.

Conclusion: 该技术能有效解决企业特定代码问题，无需大模型的计算开销。

Abstract: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code
and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality,
end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive
post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic
dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This
approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model
while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of
enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.

Result: 在不同应用场景实验中，TDDev比现有基线整体准确率提高14.4%。

Conclusion: TDDev能有效生成可靠、高质量的Web应用，无需人工干预。

Abstract: Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive,
demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although
recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated
webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to
front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this
work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled
LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given
a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives
executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user
interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements
are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation,
including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出基于LLM的DSCHECKER方法检测和修复数据科学库API误用，实验表明结合API指令和数据信息可提升性能，实现的Dschecker agent在模拟场景也有不错表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学库以数据为中心的特点使API误用检测更具挑战性，需要有效方法来检测和修复。

Method: 提出DSCHECKER方法，确定API指令和数据信息，用三个LLM和五个库的误用数据进行不同提示实验，实现含自适应函数调用机制的Dschecker agent。

Result: 结合信息后，最佳模型检测F1分数达61.18%，修复51.28%的误用；Dschecker agent检测F1分数48.65%，修复39.47%的误用。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的API误用检测和修复在现实场景有应用前景。

Abstract: Data science libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, specialize in
processing and manipulating data. The data-centric nature of these libraries
makes the detection of API misuse in them more challenging. This paper
introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based approach designed for detecting and fixing
API misuses of data science libraries. We identify two key pieces of
information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for
API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data
science libraries, we experiment with various prompts. We find that
incorporating API directives and data-specific details enhances Dschecker's
ability to detect and fix API misuses, with the best-performing model achieving
a detection F1-score of 61.18 percent and fixing 51.28 percent of the misuses.
Building on these results, we implement Dschecker agent which includes an
adaptive function calling mechanism to access information on demand, simulating
a real-world setting where information about the misuse is unknown in advance.
We find that Dschecker agent achieves 48.65 percent detection F1-score and
fixes 39.47 percent of the misuses, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based API
misuse detection and fixing in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 项目管理中数据量大，现有工具学习曲线陡且需复杂编程语言获取数据，需更便捷工具。

Method: 设计JiraGPT Next软件，作为Jira的附加组件，利用GPT大语言模型，提供自然语言接口来检索信息，并评估GPT在该情境下的准确性。

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论。

Abstract: In the domain of Project Management, the sheer volume of data is a challenge
that project managers continually have to deal with. Effectively steering
projects from inception to completion requires handling of diverse information
streams, including timelines, budgetary considerations, and task dependencies.
To navigate this data-driven landscape with precision and agility, project
managers must rely on efficient and sophisticated tools. These tools have
become essential, as they enable project managers to streamline communication,
optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions in real-time.
However, many of these tools have steep learning curves and require using
complex programming languages to retrieve the exact data that project managers
need. In this work we present JiraGPT Next, a software that uses the GPT Large
Language Model to ease the process by which project managers deal with large
amounts of data. It is conceived as an add-on for Jira, one of the most popular
Project Management tools, and provides a natural language interface to retrieve
information. This work presents the design decisions behind JiraGPT Next and an
evaluation of the accuracy of GPT in this context, including the effects of
providing different prompts to complete a particular task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对开源大语言模型开发前后协作方法的全面研究，限制了对项目启动、组织和治理的理解，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 对来自不同地区、不同类型机构的14个开源大语言模型开发者进行半结构化访谈。

Result: 一是开源大语言模型项目的协作范围广泛；二是开发者有多种社会、经济和技术动机；三是样本项目呈现五种不同组织模型。

Conclusion: 为支持全球AI开放未来社区建设的利益相关者提供实用建议。

Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant
ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after
their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our
understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed
as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further.
We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration
throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on
semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots
projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research
and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the
LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks,
leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute
partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of
social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access
and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding
language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five
distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to
non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of
control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM
lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking
to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a
specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software
Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers
by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without
manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based
benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To
address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We
combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task
of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model
runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B
and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online:

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于静态基准测试评估AI驱动的自动化程序修复（APR）解决方案存在数据污染风险和难以评估动态多样场景能力的问题。

Method: 引入BloomAPR框架，以Defects4J为案例，评估ChatRepair和CigaR在三种不同LLM下的表现。

Result: 现有解决方案在基本推理和记忆修复模式上表现较好，但在处理合成生成的错误、小语法更改和真实项目中的类似错误时表现各异。

Conclusion: 迫切需要改进基准测试，为更可靠地评估LLM驱动的软件工程解决方案奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the
development of AI-driven automated program repair (APR) solutions. However,
these solutions are typically evaluated using static benchmarks such as
Defects4J and SWE-bench, which suffer from two key limitations: (1) the risk of
data contamination, potentially inflating evaluation results due to overlap
with LLM training data, and (2) limited ability to assess the APR capabilities
in dynamic and diverse contexts. In this paper, we introduced BloomAPR, a novel
dynamic evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. Our framework offers
a structured approach to assess the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered APR
solutions across progressively complex reasoning levels. Using Defects4J as a
case study, we evaluated two state-of-the-art LLM-powered APR solutions,
ChatRepair and CigaR, under three different LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, and
StarCoder-2. Our findings show that while these solutions exhibit basic
reasoning skills and effectively memorize bug-fixing patterns (fixing up to
81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer), their performance increases with
synthetically generated bugs (up to 60.66% increase at the Understand layer).
However, they perform worse on minor syntactic changes (fixing up to 43.32% at
the Apply layer), and they struggle to repair similar bugs when injected into
real-world projects (solving only 13.46% to 41.34% bugs at the Analyze layer).
These results underscore the urgent need for evolving benchmarks and provide a
foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering
solutions.

Motivation: 现有函数名预测方法存在架构特定限制、数据稀缺和命名约定多样等问题，为后续漏洞分析和补丁提供支持。

Method: 构建Feature - Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs)，用分层图神经网络处理，使用受Renée启发的解码器，增强注意力头层和算法改进。

Result: 在9000个ELF可执行二进制文件数据集上，精度最高提升27.17%，召回率最高提升55.86%，对未见架构召回率高5.89%。

Conclusion: AGNOMIN性能优于现有方法，泛化性好，有实际应用价值，可辅助逆向工程师分析和修补不同架构的易受攻击二进制文件。

Abstract: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in
software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent
vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often
struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse
naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach
for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds
Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs,
Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A
hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate
consistent function representations across architectures, vital for
\textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN
employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer
and algorithmic improvements.
  We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable
binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in
precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN
generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than
the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through
security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing
and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.

Conclusion: 所建立的初步清单能有效帮助M&S新手选择合适范式解决问题。

Abstract: The advent of increasingly complex and dynamic ecosystems, such as digital
twins (DT), smart cities and Industry 4.0 and 5.0, has made evident the need to
include modeling and simulation (M&S) in the software development life cycle.
Such disruptive systems include simulation models in their own architecture
(such as DT) or require the use of simulation models to represent the high
degree of movement and the multiplicity of interactions that occur between the
involved systems. However, when software engineers (particularly the newcomers)
need to use M&S in their projects, they often pose themselves an important
question: which formalism should I use? In this direction, the main
contribution of this paper is the establishment of a preliminary checklist with
questions to assist beginners in M&S in choosing the most appropriate paradigm
to solve their problems. The checklist is based on three main formalisms: DEVS,
System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation. A pilot study was carried out and
an expert was consulted. The preliminary results show (i) conformance between
the suggestion given by the checklist and the formalism selected in the
original studies used as input for evaluating the checklist, and (ii) a
positive feedback from the expert.

Abstract: Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming
assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete
assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated
Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in
identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges
when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method
level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for
students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While
some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on
predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to
LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,
explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via
LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual
information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying
faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the
LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both
localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we
introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from
multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault
localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207
more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational
contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software
codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.

Conclusion: 评估了经典CCD工具对AI生成克隆的检测效果，指出归一化技术对提高检测准确性的作用，还提供工具选择的分析。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated code has reshaped modern software
development, introducing syntactic and semantic variations in cloned code.
Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic
syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training
data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection
(CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored
codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic
clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex
semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD
tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine
widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing
GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further
test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench
and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between
traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical
CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques,
retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some
exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks. This
paper contributes by (1) evaluating classical CCD tools against AI-generated
clones, providing critical insights into their current strengths and
limitations; (2) highlighting the role of normalization techniques in improving
detection accuracy; and (3) delivering detailed scalability and execution-time
analyses to support practical CCD tool selection.

Conclusion: LogPilot是一个自动化且实用的服务告警诊断解决方案。

Abstract: Effective alert diagnosis is essential for ensuring the reliability of
large-scale online service systems. However, on-call engineers are often
burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root
causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in
practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize
complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot
introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert
definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and
requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into
a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring
execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for
diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in
diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window.
Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the
usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization
accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under
one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully
deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for
service alert diagnosis.

Conclusion: 首次挑战通过测试的补丁就安全可靠的传统假设，指出当前APR代理评估范式的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks
such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub
issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs.
However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of
APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while
largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like
GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an
important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on
GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct
but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which
generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce
patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in
three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points
for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading
reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue
semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements
based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent
pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that
are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the
correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20).
Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional
assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure,
highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR
agents.

Conclusion: R - Log在日志分析任务中表现良好，能解决现有方法的局限，R - Log - fast可在保证一定效能下提升速度。

Abstract: The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current
approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label
pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose
LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's
imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm
critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To
address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm
that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human
engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying
rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing
hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first
cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13
strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning
capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.
Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing
methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by
228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the
efficacy.

Abstract: Energy consumption of mobile apps is a domain that is receiving a lot of
attention from researchers. Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption
of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps.
Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we
explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings
in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell
refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps.
Refactoring of the code smells "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" reduce
energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption,
however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of
execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell
refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order
in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that
some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy
consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to
investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and
number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and
type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and
performance after refactoring.

Abstract: Software code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the
most successful applications of modern artificial intelligence. Foundational
models are very effective for popular frameworks that benefit from
documentation, examples, and strong community support. In contrast, specialized
scientific libraries often lack these resources and may expose unstable APIs
under active development, making it difficult for models trained on limited or
outdated data. We address these issues for the Gammapy library by developing an
agent capable of writing, executing, and validating code in a controlled
environment. We present a minimal web demo and an accompanying benchmarking
suite. This contribution summarizes the design, reports our current status, and
outlines next steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能代码生成基准存在编程语言单一、任务级别局限、测试用例少等不平衡问题，需要建立公平且健壮的基准。

Method: 提出MultiOOP基准，设计翻译器扩展现有单语言基准和指标到多语言，提出自动化框架增加测试用例。

Result: 评估发现大模型在MultiOOP上性能大幅下降、跨语言表现差异大、存在概念理解差距。

Conclusion: 公开基准、指标扩展和评估脚本，促进大模型在面向对象代码生成的更平衡和全面评估。

Abstract: Establishing fair and robust benchmarks is essential for evaluating
intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35
existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single
programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level
tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address
these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming
benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an
existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual
setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases
to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream
LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial
performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6
percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2)
Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but
only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual
generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2
points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable
code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric
extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more
balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code
generation. Our code and data will be released at
https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeai-dteam/MultiOOP respectively.

TL;DR: 分析开发者活动模式，用网络建模框架研究社会机制，识别活动级联现象并用于开发流失预测方法，揭示开源软件社区集体社会动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开发者集体社会行为，以建模和预测开源软件社区长期动态和可持续性。

Method: 分析开发者时间活动模式，采用基于网络的建模框架，通过共同编辑网络捕捉开发者交互，利用大数据集识别活动级联。

Result: 活动级联在超半数研究项目中是统计显著现象，开发出简单实用的流失预测方法。

Conclusion: 揭示开源软件社区集体社会动态，强调活动级联对理解开发者流失和留存的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the collective social behavior of software developers is
crucial to model and predict the long-term dynamics and sustainability of Open
Source Software (OSS) communities. To this end, we analyze temporal activity
patterns of developers, revealing an inherently ``bursty'' nature of commit
contributions. To investigate the social mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
adopt a network-based modelling framework that captures developer interactions
through co-editing networks. Our framework models social interactions, where a
developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity
among collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we
further develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the
propagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our
results suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant
phenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our
insights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method
that forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds
light on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and
highlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn
and retention in collaborative software projects.

TL;DR: 对Java应用开发者编写的测试进行实证研究，对比现有测试与ATG工具生成的测试，指出当前工具不足并给出研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对开发者编写测试的特征理解不足，需评估ATG技术和工具生成真实代表性测试的能力。

Method: 对开源仓库中170万个Java应用测试用例进行实证研究，研究现有文献忽视的测试方面，并与两个先进ATG工具生成的测试对比。

Result: 绝大多数开发者编写的测试具有当前ATG工具无法实现的特征。

Conclusion: 确定了有前景的研究方向，有望使ATG工具更接近开发者编写的测试。

Abstract: Automated test generation (ATG), which aims to reduce the cost of manual test
suite development, has been investigated for decades and has produced countless
techniques based on a variety of approaches: symbolic analysis, search-based,
random and adaptive-random, learning-based, and, most recently,
large-language-model-based approaches. However, despite this large body of
research, there is still a gap in our understanding of the characteristics of
developer-written tests and, consequently, in our assessment of how well ATG
techniques and tools can generate realistic and representative tests. To bridge
this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study of developer-written tests
for Java applications, covering 1.7 million test cases from open-source
repositories. Our study is the first of its kind in studying aspects of
developer-written tests that are mostly neglected in the existing literature,
such as test scope, test fixtures and assertions, types of inputs, and use of
mocking. Based on the characterization, we then compare existing tests with
those generated by two state-of-the-art ATG tools. Our results highlight that a
vast majority of developer-written tests exhibit characteristics that are
beyond the capabilities of current ATG tools. Finally, based on the insights
gained from the study, we identify promising research directions that can help
bridge the gap between current tool capabilities and more effective tool
support for developer testing practices. We hope that this work can set the
stage for new advances in the field and bring ATG tools closer to generating
the types of tests developers write.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪和日志采样方法采用分析前采样范式，会丢弃故障相关信息，影响系统行为诊断透明度。

Method: 先对完整数据流进行轻量级多模态异常检测和根因分析，然后基于分析结果采用双支柱采样策略。

Result: 在2.5%采样率下，捕获56.5%关键跟踪和96.25%相关日志，下游根因分析准确率提高42.45%，10分钟遥测数据处理时间少于5秒。

Conclusion: UniSage显著优于现有基线，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Traces and logs are essential for observability and fault diagnosis in modern
distributed systems. However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial
storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically
adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics,
they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in
diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first
unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware
paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight
and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete
data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic
insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal
and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated
by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors
are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical
signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5%
sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant
logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by
42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry
data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production
environments.

Method: PRO4RS工作组作为ReSA和RDA联合倡议，审查并推进全球各机构研究软件政策发展，分析相关政策。

Result: 利用PRO4RS工作组的产出和分析，找出了关键政策缺口，特别是在研究评估改革政策中对研究软件人员考虑不足的问题。

Conclusion: 研究机构需实施并采用健全政策来支持研究软件发展、使用和可持续性，当前针对研究软件的机构层面政策仍有局限。

Abstract: As research software becomes increasingly central to modern science,
research-performing organisations (RPOs) need to ensure that their investment
in people, skills and infrastructure around research software produces
sustainable and maintainable software that improves the research they perform,
which in turn improves the overall institution and its reputation and funding,
for example, by competing with peers who lack this approach. However, research
institution management and recognition of research software and its personnel
has mostly often developed in an ad hoc manner. RPO training infrastructures,
recognition and reward structures, have not developed at a sufficient rate to
support and encourage both the widespread use of research software best
practices and the long-term support for technical roles that is required. To
begin to address this fundamental problem for modern research environments,
RPOs must implement and adopt robust policies to support research software
development, use, and sustainability. Despite growing momentum from funders and
publishers around FAIR and open science principles, research
institutional-level policies specifically addressing research software remain
limited or lacking in breadth.
  This article outlines the work of the Policies in Research Organisations for
Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group (WG), a joint initiative of the
Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA), which
examined and advanced research software policy development across institutions
worldwide. After consideration of the rationale for institutional policies on
research software, the PRO4RS WG outputs and analysis are utilised to highlight
critical policy gaps, particularly related to consideration of research
software personnel in policy work focused on reform of research assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有“Robin's Rule”算法生成单一测试套件，若测试用例为系统约束的非法输入，无法实现100%覆盖，需解决此风险。

Method: 对表达式的抽象语法树进行代数重排，系统生成语义等价的SBE，对每个结构变体应用“Robin's Rule”生成多样测试套件。

Result: 未提及具体结果，提出可产生多样测试套件，提供找到有效测试套件的途径。

Conclusion: EQ - Robin为确保稳健的MC/DC覆盖提供了实际解决方案。

Abstract: Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), particularly its strict
Unique-Cause form, is a cornerstone of safety-critical software verification. A
recent algorithm, "Robin's Rule," introduced a deterministic method to
construct the theoretical minimum of N+1 test cases for Singular Boolean
Expressions (SBEs). However, this approach yields only a single test suite,
introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence
pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to
achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline
that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to
mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating
semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying
Robin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be
produced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that
preserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.
We outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how
EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage.

TL;DR: 提出ErrorPrism用于自动化重构生产微服务系统中的错误传播路径，在字节跳动的微服务上评估表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务系统可靠性管理因故障级联效应具有挑战性，错误包装带来溯源问题，现有方法无效。

Method: 先对服务代码库进行静态分析构建函数调用图并映射日志字符串，再用LLM代理进行迭代反向搜索。

Result: 在67个生产微服务上评估，对102个真实错误路径重构准确率达97.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ErrorPrism为工业微服务系统的根因分析提供了有效实用的工具。

Abstract: Reliability management in cloud service systems is challenging due to the
cascading effect of failures. Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern
microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the
function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from
its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a
significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation
path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are
ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism
in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in
production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on
service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to
relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space
for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an
iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop
error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism
achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors,
outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism
provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial
microservice systems.

Method: 提取代理响应的形式化表示，使用形式验证和程序分析工具验证推理步骤。

Result: 应用于基准测试，对未初始化变量错误，形式验证能验证13/20的示例；对程序等价查询，成功捕捉6/8的错误判断。

Conclusion: 所提自动验证方法在一定程度上有效，可用于提升代码推理代理答案的可靠性。

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning
questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from
being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a
software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer
during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an
automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,
improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be
manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses
from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower
developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In
this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided
by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high
level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's
response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis
tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable
errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the
uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to
validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program
equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8
incorrect judgments made by the agent.

<details>

Motivation: 现有黑盒上下文无关语法推理工具在处理大型复杂语言时存在可扩展性、可读性和准确性问题。

Method: NatGI扩展TreeVada的解析树恢复，采用括号引导的气泡探索、LLM驱动的气泡生成和非终结符标记、分层增量调试（HDD）进行系统树简化。

Result: 在综合基准测试中，NatGI的F1分数平均为0.57，比最佳基线TreeVada高25个百分点，生成语法的可解释性显著更好。

Conclusion: NatGI能让开发者和研究人员在获得更高准确性的同时，轻松检查、验证和推理诱导语法的结构和语义。

Abstract: Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis,
reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada,
and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large,
complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference
framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key
innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation
and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for
systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic
cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while
LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising
merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the
grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI
on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones
such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms
strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score
of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing
baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars
perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.
Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules
with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more
closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can
achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and
reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.

Abstract: In this review, we provide practical guidance on some of the main machine
learning tools used in portfolio weight formation. This is not an exhaustive
list, but a fraction of the ones used and have some statistical analysis behind
it. All this research is essentially tied to precision matrix of excess asset
returns. Our main point is that the techniques should be used in conjunction
with outlined objective functions. In other words, there should be joint
analysis of Machine Learning (ML) technique with the possible portfolio
choice-objective functions in terms of test period Sharpe Ratio or returns. The
ML method with the best objective function should provide the weight for
portfolio formation. Empirically we analyze five time periods of interest, that
are out-sample and show performance of some ML-Artificial Intelligence (AI)
methods. We see that nodewise regression with Global Minimum Variance portfolio
based weights deliver very good Sharpe Ratio and returns across five time
periods in this century we analyze. We cover three downturns, and 2 long term

Abstract: We propose a framework for conditional vector quantile regression (CVQR) that
combines neural optimal transport with amortized optimization, and apply it to
multivariate conformal prediction. Classical quantile regression does not
extend naturally to multivariate responses, while existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of joint distributions. Our method parametrizes the
conditional vector quantile function as the gradient of a convex potential
implemented by an input-convex neural network, ensuring monotonicity and
uniform ranks. To reduce the cost of solving high-dimensional variational
problems, we introduced amortized optimization of the dual potentials, yielding
efficient training and faster inference. We then exploit the induced
multivariate ranks for conformal prediction, constructing distribution-free
predictive regions with finite-sample validity. Unlike coordinatewise methods,
our approach adapts to the geometry of the conditional distribution, producing
tighter and more informative regions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show
improved coverage-efficiency trade-offs compared to baselines, highlighting the
benefits of integrating neural optimal transport with conformal prediction.

Conclusion: 所提方法优于先前方法。

Abstract: We develop new classifiers under group fairness in the attribute-aware
setting for binary classification with multiple group fairness constraints
(e.g., demographic parity (DP), equalized odds (EO), and predictive parity
(PP)). We propose a novel approach, applicable to linear fractional
constraints, based on directly intervening on the operating characteristics of
a pre-trained base classifier, by (i) identifying optimal operating
characteristics using the base classifier's group-wise ROC convex hulls and
(ii) post-processing the base classifier to match those targets. As practical
post-processors, we consider randomizing a mixture of group-wise thresholding
rules subject to minimizing the expected number of interventions. We further
extend our approach to handle multiple protected attributes and multiple linear
fractional constraints. On standard datasets (COMPAS and ACSIncome), our
methods simultaneously satisfy approximate DP, EO, and PP with few
interventions and a near-oracle drop in accuracy; comparing favorably to
previous methods.

Conclusion: CGMMD在涉及复杂条件密度的合成任务以及图像去噪和图像超分辨率等实际应用中具有竞争力。

Abstract: How can we generate samples from a conditional distribution that we never
fully observe? This question arises across a broad range of applications in
both modern machine learning and classical statistics, including image
post-processing in computer vision, approximate posterior sampling in
simulation-based inference, and conditional distribution modeling in complex
data settings. In such settings, compared with unconditional sampling,
additional feature information can be leveraged to enable more adaptive and
efficient sampling. Building on this, we introduce Conditional Generator using
MMD (CGMMD), a novel framework for conditional sampling. Unlike many
contemporary approaches, our method frames the training objective as a simple,
adversary-free direct minimization problem. A key feature of CGMMD is its
ability to produce conditional samples in a single forward pass of the
generator, enabling practical one-shot sampling with low test-time complexity.
We establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the loss incurred when sampling
from the CGMMD sampler, and prove convergence of the estimated distribution to
the true conditional distribution. In the process, we also develop a uniform
concentration result for nearest-neighbor based functionals, which may be of
independent interest. Finally, we show that CGMMD performs competitively on
synthetic tasks involving complex conditional densities, as well as on

Abstract: In binary classification applications, conservative decision-making that
allows for abstention can be advantageous. To this end, we introduce a novel
approach that determines the optimal cutoff interval for risk scores, which can
be directly available or derived from fitted models. Within this interval, the
algorithm refrains from making decisions, while outside the interval,
classification accuracy is maximized. Our approach is inspired by support
vector machines (SVM), but differs in that it minimizes the classification
margin rather than maximizing it. We provide the theoretical optimal solution
to this problem, which holds important practical implications. Our proposed
method not only supports conservative decision-making but also inherently
results in a risk-coverage curve. Together with the area under the curve (AUC),
this curve can serve as a comprehensive performance metric for evaluating and
comparing classifiers, akin to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve. To investigate and illustrate our approach, we conduct both simulation
studies and a real-world case study in the context of diagnosing prostate
cancer.

Conclusion: 结合因果桥与自编码器架构能提升因果效应估计质量，且该方法在推断治疗因果效应上具有优势。

Abstract: We consider inferring the causal effect of a treatment (intervention) on an
outcome of interest in situations where there is potentially an unobserved
confounder influencing both the treatment and the outcome. This is achievable
by assuming access to two separate sets of control (proxy) measurements
associated with treatment and outcomes, which are used to estimate treatment
effects through a function termed the em causal bridge (CB). We present a new
theoretical perspective, associated assumptions for when estimating treatment
effects with the CB is feasible, and a bound on the average error of the
treatment effect when the CB assumptions are violated. From this new
perspective, we then demonstrate how coupling the CB with an autoencoder
architecture allows for the sharing of statistical strength between observed
quantities (proxies, treatment, and outcomes), thus improving the quality of
the CB estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in relation to the state-of-the-art
methodology for proxy measurements.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient sampling from complex and high dimensional target distributions
turns out to be a fundamental task in diverse disciplines such as scientific
computing, statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we revisit the
randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) for sampling from high dimensional
distributions without log-concavity. Under the gradient Lipschitz condition and
the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove a uniform-in-time error bound in
$\mathcal{W}_2$-distance of order $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ for the RLMC sampling
algorithm, which matches the best one in the literature under the log-concavity
condition. Moreover, when the gradient of the potential $U$ is non-globally
Lipschitz with superlinear growth, modified RLMC algorithms are proposed and
analyzed, with non-asymptotic error bounds established. To the best of our
knowledge, the modified RLMC algorithms and their non-asymptotic error bounds
are new in the non-globally Lipschitz setting.

Result: 建立预测风险上界，揭示TTT使单层Transformer适应特征向量和链接函数，给出收敛率。

Conclusion: TTT能让模型适应任务变化，随着上下文大小和网络宽度增加，预测误差可接近噪声水平。

Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) enhances model performance by explicitly updating
designated parameters prior to each prediction to adapt to the test data. While
TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical
underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper,
we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the
model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time.
We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models
$y=\sigma_*(\langle \beta, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$, where the feature vector
$\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer
transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we
establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT
enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector
$\beta$ and the link function $\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates
a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to
shifts in the link function. Moreover, we provide the convergence rate with
respect to the data length, showing the predictive error can be driven
arbitrarily close to the noise level as the context size and the network width
grow.

Conclusion: 给出的精确表达式有助于理解非凸优化问题中基于梯度方法的隐式偏差，对研究损失函数几何形状有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to
explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex
optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix
factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum
eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the
landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact
expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this
paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized
deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems,
resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). To complement
our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during
gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact
expression of the sharpness.

Motivation: 克服经典基于向量的图信号处理（GSP）的关键局限，如同步观测假设、无法捕捉不确定性和图滤波严格对应要求。

Method: 将信号建模为图分布值信号（GDSs），建立核心GSP概念到GDS对应概念的系统映射。

Result: 通过图滤波器学习进行预测任务的实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架可有效克服经典GSP的局限，传统定义是其特殊情况。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) that models
signals as graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), which are probability
distributions in the Wasserstein space. This approach overcomes key limitations
of classical vector-based GSP, including the assumption of synchronous
observations over vertices, the inability to capture uncertainty, and the
requirement for strict correspondence in graph filtering. By representing
signals as distributions, GDSs naturally encode uncertainty and stochasticity,
while strictly generalizing traditional graph signals. We establish a
systematic dictionary mapping core GSP concepts to their GDS counterparts,
demonstrating that classical definitions are recovered as special cases. The
effectiveness of the framework is validated through graph filter learning for
prediction tasks, supported by experimental results.

Result: BALLAST辅助的顺序观测器放置策略在合成和高保真洋流模型上有显著益处。

Conclusion: 所提出的BALLAST方法在引导拉格朗日观测器放置以推断时变矢量场方面是有效的。

Abstract: We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement
of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in
oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed
spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing
placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or
relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled
active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously
advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different
locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future
trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate
placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning
with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable
benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both
synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.

Method: 在不变的提升表示中研究PAC - Bayes界。

Result: 探索了该方法提供的保证（不变性、通过数据处理得到更紧的界）和基于KL的尺度不变PAC - Bayes界的算法方面。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但暗示该方法在解决ReLU网络PAC - Bayes复杂度差异问题上有研究价值。

Abstract: A central challenge in understanding generalization is to obtain non-vacuous
guarantees that go beyond worst-case complexity over data or weight space.
Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayes bounds stand out as they can provide
tight, data-dependent guarantees even for large networks. However, in ReLU
networks, rescaling invariances mean that different weight distributions can
represent the same function while leading to arbitrarily different PAC-Bayes
complexities. We propose to study PAC-Bayes bounds in an invariant, lifted
representation that resolves this discrepancy. This paper explores both the
guarantees provided by this approach (invariance, tighter bounds via data
processing) and the algorithmic aspects of KL-based rescaling-invariant
PAC-Bayes bounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) algorithm is a widely used Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions when exact
conditional sampling is intractable. We study MwG with Random Walk Metropolis
(RWM) updates, using proposal variances tuned to match the target's conditional
variances. Assuming the target $\pi$ is a $d$-dimensional log-concave
distribution with condition number $\kappa$, we establish a spectral gap lower
bound of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa d)$ for the random-scan version of MwG,
improving on the previously available $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa^2 d)$ bound. This
is obtained by developing sharp estimates of the conductance of one-dimensional
RWM kernels, which can be of independent interest. The result shows that MwG
can mix substantially faster with variance-adaptive proposals and that its
mixing performance is just a constant factor worse than that of the exact Gibbs
sampler, thus providing theoretical support to previously observed empirical
behavior.

Abstract: Predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making is
central for optimizing therapeutic decisions in personalized medicine (e.g.,
which dosing sequence to give to a cancer patient). However, predicting
potential outcomes over long horizons is notoriously difficult. Existing
methods that break the curse of the horizon typically lack strong theoretical
guarantees such as orthogonality and quasi-oracle efficiency. In this paper, we
revisit the problem of predicting individualized potential outcomes in
sequential decision-making (i.e., estimating Q-functions in Markov decision
processes with observational data) through a causal inference lens. In
particular, we develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for meta-learners
in this setting with a focus on beneficial theoretical properties. As a result,
we yield a novel meta-learner called DRQ-learner and establish that it is: (1)
doubly robust (i.e., valid inference under the misspecification of one of the
nuisances), (2) Neyman-orthogonal (i.e., insensitive to first-order estimation
errors in the nuisance functions), and (3) achieves quasi-oracle efficiency
(i.e., behaves asymptotically as if the ground-truth nuisance functions were
known). Our DRQ-learner is applicable to settings with both discrete and
continuous state spaces. Further, our DRQ-learner is flexible and can be used
together with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We
validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, thereby showing
that our meta-learner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a central capability of Transformer models, but
the structures in data that enable its emergence and govern its robustness
remain poorly understood. In this work, we study how the structure of
pretraining tasks governs generalization in ICL. Using a solvable model for ICL
of linear regression by linear attention, we derive an exact expression for ICL
generalization error in high dimensions under arbitrary pretraining-testing
task covariance mismatch. This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies
how much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for
inference at test time. We show that this measure directly predicts ICL
performance not only in the solvable model but also in nonlinear Transformers.
Our analysis further reveals a tradeoff between specialization and
generalization in ICL: depending on task distribution alignment, increasing
pretraining task diversity can either improve or harm test performance.
Together, these results identify train-test task alignment as a key determinant
of generalization in ICL.

Conclusion: 所提估计器更准确，可用于测量全局和局部维度。

Abstract: The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich
insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and
biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global
dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows
and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the
participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality,
is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected
estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On
synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true
known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings,
including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and
to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is
invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used
to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting
the finite samples appropriately.

Motivation: 现有存储KV缓存于DRAM和SSD的方法存在高加载延迟问题，需提高DRAM上的KV缓存命中率。

Method: 设计损失压缩系统，为每个KV缓存条目确定压缩算法、压缩率和设备放置，以最大化DRAM命中并最小化加载延迟。

Result: 与多种静态压缩基线相比，AdaptCache在相同质量下实现1.43 - 2.4倍的延迟节省，在相同延迟下实现6 - 55%的质量提升。

Conclusion: 所设计的损失压缩系统AdaptCache能有效减少加载延迟并提升生成质量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed
context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant
redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant
computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the
corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these
LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large
and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high
loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To
increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression
as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the
compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache
entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly
degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines
across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at
the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently
outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns,
achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel

Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a quintessential NP-hard

but limited by exponential complexity in large instances. We propose a hybrid
quantum-classical framework integrating variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
optimisation with classical machine learning, using K-means clustering for
problem decomposition and a RandomForestRegressor for path refinement.
Evaluated on 80 European cities (from 4 to 80 cities, 38,500 samples in total)
via Qiskit's AerSimulator and ibm_kyiv 127-qubit backend, the hybrid approach
outperforms quantum-only methods, achieving an approximation ratio of 1.0287 at
80 cities, a 47.5% improvement over quantum-only's 1.9614, nearing the
classical baseline. Machine learning reduces variability in tour distances
(interquartile range, IQR - the spread of the middle 50% of results relative to
the median - from 0.06 to 0.04), enhancing stability despite noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) noise. This framework underscores hybrid
strategies' potential for scalable TSP optimisation, with future hardware

neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model
complexity but also constrain observable neural dynamics. To address this
limitation, we propose a spatially extended approach using partial differential
equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a
previously developed model of a child swinging, now incorporating spatial
dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body,
we analyze how input location and propagation along a PDE influence behavior.
This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organization in
adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the
physical constraints of embodied systems. Our results highlight the importance
of spatial dynamics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.

TL;DR: 提出基于数字孪生（DT）的方法为移动增强现实（MAR）提供以用户为中心的通信服务，仿真显示该方法比5G切片通信服务满足相机帧上传延迟要求的比例提高14.2%。

Motivation: 为应对用户特定和非平稳的上行链路数据流量，为MAR提供沉浸式用户体验。

Method: 先构建适用于MAR的数据模型以建立单个MAR设备的DT，定义两个DT操作函数以适应非平稳数据流量，基于DT的用户导向数据管理提出网络资源管理算法。

Result: 跟踪驱动的仿真结果表明，以用户为中心的通信服务比5G切片通信服务满足相机帧上传延迟要求的比例提高了14.2%。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于DT的方法能有效应对用户特定和非平稳的上行链路数据流量，为MAR提供更好的通信服务。

Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile
augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices
and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices
must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to
cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a
digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service
provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices,
we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate
impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data
traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively
enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing
non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management
introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that
ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent
inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven
simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service
provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay
requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service
provision widely used for 5G.

Conclusion: 所提出的无偏记忆设计能有效解决代理的认知偏差问题，提升6G RAN - Edge网络资源编排的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource
orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model
(LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy
efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative
negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents
dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and
leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed
agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into
strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents
are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past
experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases
-- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup
version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use
at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i)
semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning
from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory
inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii)
diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and
primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation
results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory
allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies,
either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of
unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines,
respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving
latency and energy saving distributions.

Conclusion: 新架构可有效解决可扩展性问题，能为不同晶体结构生成高精度平衡系综和自由能，可达到有限尺寸效应可忽略的规模。

Abstract: The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body
systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted
substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated
samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the
natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major
challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that
addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials
science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural
networks to base the generation process on local environmental information,
while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to
previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far
less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies.
Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which
allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of
unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it
to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of
mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one
thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate
equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and
Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where
finite-size effects become negligible.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific
hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by
the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address
this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated
hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground
their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that
our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms
standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational
efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs
toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The

Abstract: Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate
physical concepts. Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine
learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are
able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and
its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application
of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a
hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space
topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and
generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a
tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying
the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights
the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping
stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning
representations in condensed matter physics.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the asymptotically optimal tuning parameter choice
in ridge regression for estimating nuisance functions of a statistical
functional that has recently gained prominence in conditional independence
testing and causal inference. Given a sample of size $n$, we study estimators
of the Expected Conditional Covariance (ECC) between variables $Y$ and $A$
given a high-dimensional covariate $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Under linear
regression models for $Y$ and $A$ on $X$ and the proportional asymptotic regime
$p/n \to c \in (0, \infty)$, we evaluate three existing ECC estimators and two
sample splitting strategies for estimating the required nuisance functions.
Since no consistent estimator of the nuisance functions exists in the
proportional asymptotic regime without imposing further structure on the
problem, we first derive debiased versions of the ECC estimators that utilize
the ridge regression nuisance function estimators. We show that our bias
correction strategy yields $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimators of the ECC across
different sample splitting strategies and estimator choices. We then derive the
asymptotic variances of these debiased estimators to illustrate the nuanced
interplay between the sample splitting strategy, estimator choice, and tuning
parameters of the nuisance function estimators for optimally estimating the
ECC. Our analysis reveals that prediction-optimal tuning parameters (i.e.,
those that optimally estimate the nuisance functions) may not lead to the
lowest asymptotic variance of the ECC estimator -- thereby demonstrating the
need to be careful in selecting tuning parameters based on the final goal of
inference. Finally, we verify our theoretical results through extensive
numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SQUARE框架提升无训练零样本CIR性能，在四个基准测试表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无训练零样本CIR方法虽理想，但准确捕捉用户意图有挑战，需提升其性能。

Method: 提出两阶段无训练框架SQUARE，在SQAF阶段用MLLM生成的描述丰富查询嵌入；在EBR阶段用MLLM对候选图像进行视觉语义联合推理并重排名。

Result: SQUARE在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现良好，使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Motivation: 扩散模型推理慢且存在训练 - 推理差异，基于梯度的求解器在信息传输效率上缺乏理论基础。

Method: 引入信息论视角分析推理过程，提出熵感知方差优化方法EVODiff，在去噪时优化条件熵以减少不确定性。

Result: 实验验证了研究见解，EVODiff显著且持续优于现有基于梯度的求解器，如在CIFAR - 10上降低重建误差，在ImageNet - 256上减少函数评估次数，改善文本到图像生成并减少伪影。

Conclusion: 所提信息论视角和EVODiff方法有效，能提升扩散模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Method: 提出UML - CoT框架，利用UML类图和活动图，采用三阶段训练管道，结合监督微调与GRPO及从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom - 30k基准测试中，UML - CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率上优于非结构化思维链。

Conclusion: UML是一种更具表现力和可操作性的结构化推理形式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Result: 文献中常用的感知损失配置表现不如更好设计的替代方案，更好的设计能显著提升降噪和结构保真度。

Conclusion: 给出在LDCT去噪中有效使用感知损失的客观指南。

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Motivation: 探究现有VLMs是否真的解决了基础视觉理解问题，认为当前基准可能高估了VLMs性能。

Method: 创建包含2720个问答对的VisualOverload基准，用公共领域绘画图像，人工标注六类问题，对37个模型进行测试。

Result: 37个模型中最好的o3在最难测试子集上准确率19.6%，所有问题整体准确率69.5%，错误分析揭示多种失败模式。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型的关键差距，为社区开发更好模型提供重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

Result: 模型存在自我中心偏差、旋转理解差等弱点，有能力提升和涌现能力，人类准确率高且任务难度与模型准确率相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为VLMs空间推理提供关键见解，凸显其物理空间推理能力差距。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构的深度多模态融合内在能力对实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

### [413] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

TL;DR: 提出LLM - RG混合管道用于户外驾驶场景指称定位，在Talk2Car基准测试中表现出色，证明VLMs和LLMs互补优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景指称定位因场景多变、相似物体多和动态元素而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出LLM - RG混合管道，结合视觉语言模型进行细粒度属性提取和大语言模型进行符号推理，处理图像和指称表达式。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM - RG比基于LLM和VLM的基线有显著提升，添加3D空间线索进一步改善定位。

Conclusion: VLMs和LLMs以零样本方式应用，在户外指称定位中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VISOR++方法，通过优化视觉输入实现对视觉语言模型的行为控制，在多种模型上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型行为控制方法有局限，需寻找跨多模型的转向方法。

Method: 引入基于通用视觉输入的输出重定向方法VISOR++，生成可模拟转向向量的图像。

Result: VISOR++图像在多种模型上有效，能实现行为转向，对未知模型也有潜力，且在无关任务上保留高性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++无需运行时访问模型，与部署无关，是有效的视觉语言模型行为控制方法。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Vision - Zero框架解决VLM训练依赖人工标注数据集问题，可通过视觉游戏自提升，表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习提升VLM推理能力的方法依赖人工标注数据集，训练成本高，限制实际部署。

Method: 提出Vision - Zero框架，包含战略自玩框架、可从任意图像生成游戏、迭代自玩策略优化（Iterative - SPO）训练算法。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和以视觉为中心的理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，超越其他基于注释的方法。

Conclusion: Vision - Zero框架有效解决了VLM训练依赖人工标注数据集的问题，实现了模型的自提升。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Method: 提出基于交叉注意力的聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自邻居；引入使用该聚合方案进行非局部消息传递的AttentionViG架构。

Result: AttentionViG在ImageNet - 1K上达到SOTA性能，在下游任务如目标检测、实例分割和语义分割中表现良好，且与先前视觉GNN架构相比，在计算量相当的情况下有有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: 所提方法性能强且保持高效。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型碎片化，仅基于单一知识源，与临床实践中专家整合多样知识不符。

Method: 提出K - Prism框架，集成语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈三种知识范式，将异质知识源编码为双提示表示，通过MoE解码器动态路由。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，K - Prism在语义、上下文和交互式分割设置中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: K - Prism能灵活切换知识范式，跨多样任务联合训练，无需架构修改，性能优秀。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Result: YOLOv9结合ConSinGAN检测准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms。

Conclusion: 提出的自动缺陷检测方法可用于工业制造其他组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率的泛北极海冰映射及可靠的不确定性量化对SIC制图至关重要，但因冰特征微妙、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而困难，因此需新方法。

Method: 设计含全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改善特征提取；设计该模型的贝叶斯扩展，将参数视为随机变量以改善不确定性量化；在决策级融合三种不同类型数据以应对数据异质性。

Result: 在2021年9月泛北极数据集上测试，所提模型与其他不确定性量化方法相比，能实现高分辨率SIC地图和稳健的不确定性地图。

Conclusion: 所提的贝叶斯Transformer方法可有效用于泛北极SIC映射和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 以往图像反演方法在遵循目标文本提示方面存在挑战，无法兼顾内容保留和编辑灵活性。

Method: 提出Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion)，分析噪声图属性，引入可编辑噪声细化，最小化重建和编辑噪声图差异。

Result: ENM Inversion在多种图像编辑任务的保留和编辑保真度上优于现有方法，可用于视频编辑实现时间一致性和内容操作。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是有效的图像和视频编辑方法，能解决现有反演方法的问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

Method: 引入PIO基准测试，提出三阶段分层评估协议，从关键领域收集数据。

Result: 实验发现通用模型如GPT - 4o在精确视觉定位上不如一些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现好，S3表现差。

Conclusion: PIO基准测试可系统评估视觉语言模型具身推理能力，不同模型在不同阶段表现有差异。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述自动评估指标多针对短描述，LLM - as - a - Judge方法推理慢，需新评估指标和基准。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，基于LLM - Hybrid - as - a - Judge框架；提出LongCap - Arena基准，含7805张图像、对应描述和32246个人类判断。

Result: VELA在LongCap - Arena上优于现有指标，实现超人表现。

Conclusion: VELA和LongCap - Arena可有效解决长图像描述评估问题。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

TL;DR: 本文提出MetaChest数据集，用于胸部X光片的少样本多标签分类任务，实验表明增加类别和训练样本数可提升性能，迁移学习方法表现更好，高分辨率图像提升精度但增加计算量，高效模型可减少资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标注数据有限是深度学习用于医学图像分析的主要挑战，少样本学习在结合已知类别知识学习新类别的广义少样本分类场景中研究较少。

Method: 提出MetaChest数据集，设计元集分区和多标签情节生成算法，对标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展进行广泛实验。

Result: 增加每情节的类别数和每类训练样本数可提高分类性能；迁移学习方法始终优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算量，高效模型用更少资源达相似性能。

Conclusion: MetaChest数据集可用于胸部X光片少样本多标签分类，为医学图像分析的少样本学习提供了有效方法和实验参考。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Motivation: 现有奖励引导方法在图像编辑任务上应用少，需在保留源图像语义内容同时提升目标奖励。

Result: 在不同编辑任务的大量实验中，显著优于现有基于反演的无训练引导基线。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在奖励最大化和源图像保真度间取得更好平衡，且无奖励破解问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 本文提出广义对比学习（GCL）方法，无需新数据集整理即可提升多模态检索性能，在多个基准测试中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型在处理融合图像 - 文本模态的检索键时性能下降，常见方法需精心整理数据集且难以泛化到未见模态组合。

Method: 提出广义对比学习（GCL），在小批量内跨所有模态进行对比学习，利用现有图像 - 字幕配对数据集学习统一表示空间。

Result: 在M - BEIR、MMEB和CoVR基准测试中，GCL使现成的多模态检索模型（如VISTA、CLIP和TinyCLIP）性能持续提升。

Conclusion: GCL能有效提升多模态检索性能，且无需繁琐的新数据集整理工作。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究虽将推理能力拓展到视觉语言模型，但多模态推理存在损害感知基础的问题，需解决。

Method: 提出Vision - Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹。

Result: VAPO - Thinker - 7B模型增强了对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试取得新的最优结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法能有效解决多模态推理中视觉遗忘问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

Motivation: 传统CNN训练需大量数据，数据收集成本高，探索用游戏合成图像训练CNN检测现实卡车车轴的可行性。

Method: 创建含现实和合成卡车的三个数据库，用三种YOLO架构训练和测试，用召回率、精确率、F1分数和mAP评估结果，用Mann - Whitney U检验评估结果显著性。

Result: 游戏提取的合成图像是可靠训练数据，最高mAP达99%。

Conclusion: 合成图像可用于训练神经网络，是提取知识的可靠低成本数据来源。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出MISP - DPO框架解决现有视觉语言模型DPO方法中负样本单一问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型DPO方法依赖简单成对比较，负样本单一，无法捕捉多模态偏好复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 通过Plackett - Luce模型在多模态DPO中引入多个语义多样负样本，在CLIP空间嵌入提示和候选图像，用稀疏自编码器发现语义偏差，基于重建难度、与正样本语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett - Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中，MISP - DPO相比先前方法持续改善多模态对齐。

Conclusion: 基于偏好学习中，语义感知的多负样本采样有效。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Motivation: 探究训练数据特征对不同视觉模型对抗鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 对36个模型在不同数据集上训练，用六种黑盒攻击评估，还进行对抗微调及人类评估。

Result: 鲁棒性与数据量和模型大小呈对数关系，部分自监督模型表现好，对抗微调对结构变化泛化有改善，人机视觉有差距。

Conclusion: 规模提升鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标对实现广谱对抗弹性更具决定性作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Result: Logo - VGR在OOD设置中比强基线性能高近10分。

Conclusion: Logo - VGR具有优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Motivation: 现有深度学习视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制计算复杂度高，难以适应长时高分辨率视频，限制实际应用，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出VRWKV - Editor模型，将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于视频的扩散模型中，利用RWKV变压器的双向加权键值递归机制捕捉全局依赖。

Result: 相比现有扩散式视频编辑方法，实现最高3.7倍加速和60%的内存使用降低，在帧一致性和文本对齐方面表现有竞争力，长视频编辑速度优势更明显。

Conclusion: VRWKV - Editor模型能有效降低时空复杂度，在视频编辑中具有良好性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Conclusion: 基于叙述的弱监督方法在不使用细粒度像素级标注下有良好效果，WISH模型设计优越。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

Result: PFDepth在KITTI - 360和RealHet数据集上性能超当前主流深度网络。

Conclusion: 这是首个关于异构针孔 - 鱼眼深度估计的系统研究，有技术创新性和经验价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge - T训练时间短，整体性能优于其他方法，在低数据场景表现出色。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge能有效解决CLIP少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，是一种轻量级且强大的方法。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

Result: 实验表明在概念覆盖、平衡和鲁棒性上有改进，减少概念丢失或扭曲。

Conclusion: 轻量级纠正引导可显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐问题。

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

### [441] [EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157)
*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测模型的补丁构建方式破坏了时间连贯性，本文提出EntroPE框架，通过条件熵动态检测过渡点和放置补丁边界，实验证明其提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测模型的补丁构建方式破坏了时间连贯性，影响短期依赖和表征学习。

Method: 提出EntroPE框架，包含基于熵的动态补丁器（EDP）和自适应补丁编码器（APE），EDP定位自然时间转移点和确定补丁边界，APE捕捉补丁内依赖并生成固定大小的潜在表示，最后由全局Transformer处理嵌入以建模补丁间动态。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE提高了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁是时间序列建模的有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展框架，将数据管理从手动转向自动定向合成，为开发更可靠、持续改进的AI系统提供方向。

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

Motivation: 计算机视觉中多属性分类，特别是细胞显微镜领域的多属性分类研究不足，传统人工标注耗时成本高。

Result: AttriGen达到94.62%的准确率，显著提升模型可解释性，节省时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了新范式，可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Result: GSDD在CIFAR - 10、CIFAR - 100和ImageNet子集上达SOTA，编解码成本低。

Conclusion: GSDD简单有效，适用于不同蒸馏流程，可扩展性强。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论，旨在检验更可信解释是否更合理，确定生成合理文本解释的最佳方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成媒体兴起使深度伪造检测成为挑战，但受限于高质量数据集稀缺，且多模态大语言模型在该任务中表现不佳。

Method: 引入推理注释数据集，提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，使大语言模型推理与图像内容在段落层面对齐。

Result: PRPO大幅提高检测准确率，推理得分达4.55/5.0，消融实验表明在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 多模态推理结合视觉证据对实现更可靠、可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

Motivation: 有向目标检测（OOD）需求增长，现有点监督方法存在伪标签利用效率低和质量差的问题。

Method: 提出Point2RBox - v3模型，包含渐进式标签分配（PLA）和先验引导动态掩码损失（PGDM - Loss）。

Result: 在DOTA - v1.0、DOTA - v1.5等多个数据集上取得66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96%的成绩。

Conclusion: Point2RBox - v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，结合SAM模型和分水岭算法优势，在稀疏和密集场景表现出色，尤其在物体大小变化大或物体稀疏出现的场景有竞争力。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Conclusion: Flower近似贝叶斯后验采样，统一了即插即用方法和生成式逆求解器的观点。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Motivation: 识别长视频关键时刻对下游任务很重要，传统方法在解决任务导向的时间定位问题ToTG时存在泛化性有限和处理长视频困难的挑战。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，先确定长视频中可能包含关键时刻的粗粒度时间范围，再通过细粒度时刻划分细化范围；构建ToTG Pile数据集。

Result: TimeScope在各种设置下始终优于现有时间定位方法和流行的多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: TimeScope能有效解决ToTG这一具有挑战性的新问题。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Result: 在Places8上平衡准确率达81.27%，CSAI评估中达74.27%。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景和CSAI分类的可靠范式。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在平滑嵌入空间的似然得分替代形式是真实似然得分的有效近似，能引导去噪过程得到后验。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法依赖预对齐，在真实数据中缺乏对齐时性能下降，需要模型对姿态和尺度具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Method: 引入首个SIM(3)等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范特征、推理相似不变几何并恢复原始帧。

Result: 在去偏评估协议下，模型在PCN基准测试中优于基线，在真实驾驶和室内扫描中创下跨域记录。

Conclusion: 全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在捕捉空间关系上有挑战，早期方法与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 提出无训练方法Stitch，利用自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制融入多模态扩散变换器，生成单个对象并拼接。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch提升了Qwen - Image、FLUX和SD3.5等模型性能，如让FLUX在GenEval的Position任务提升218%，在PosEval提升206%。

Conclusion: Stitch在不训练的情况下将位置控制融入领先模型，取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多频段在受限设备中支持，信道质量变化、天线视野和测量稀疏性给多频段信道跟踪带来挑战，需预测可实现速率。

Method: 提出基于变压器的神经架构，以异步速率历史为输入，输出每个阵列的速率预测。

Result: 在密集城市微蜂窝场景的射线追踪模拟中，该方法表现优于基线预测器。

Conclusion: 该方法能在现实移动性和硬件约束下实现更明智的频段选择。

Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands
over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3.
These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple
antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality
across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of
antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose
significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper
formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna
arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a
transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as
input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced
simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays,
our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling
more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

Motivation: 在MISO下行无线网路中，强调用户速率可靠性的情况下，解决加权和速率最大化问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在解决MISO下行无线网路加权和速率最大化问题上有效，能提升用户速率可靠性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate
reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex
WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading
uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed
precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design
a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation
(PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to
maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel
realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that
a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and
substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while
retaining adequate ergodic performance.

TL;DR: 本文探讨中频段频谱共享问题，提出利用GNSS信号进行室内外分类，多种方法评估显示GNSS及多模态数据融合有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频谱共享缺乏可靠自动室内外设备判定方法，需解决相关挑战以实现自动发射功率调整。

Method: 利用GNSS信号进行室内外分类，开发基于阈值技术和机器学习方法，用不同地理位置扩展数据集评估。

Result: GNSS方法比仅依赖Wi-Fi数据的方法更准确，尤其在陌生地点；GNSS与Wi-Fi数据融合可提高分类精度。

Conclusion: 多模态数据融合在室内外分类中有显著优势，有助于频谱共享中自动发射功率调整。

Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and
commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial
indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to
spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents
can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,
between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where
unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor
incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no
reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or
outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor
access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and
reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate
indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling
automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To
this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for
I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and
highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and
distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various
methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning
approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse
geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone
can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)
data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of
GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,
showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

Motivation: 基于结构的蛋白质设计在处理大结构域或跨多个结构域时存在计算成本高和成功率低的问题。

Method: 提出仅保留结合位点周围不连续表面残基的表位策略，开发包含蒙特卡罗进化步骤和位置特异性反向折叠步骤的定制流程。

Result: 相比完整结构域工作流程，提高计算机模拟成功率达80%，将每次成功设计的平均时间缩短达40倍，可对之前难以处理的目标进行结合物设计。

Conclusion: 建立了针对大且难以处理目标的高效结合物设计通用框架，支持了“局部优先”假设作为基于蛋白质折叠神经网络设计的指导原则。

Abstract: Recent advances in structure-based protein design have accelerated de novo
binder generation, yet interfaces on large domains or spanning multiple domains
remain challenging due to high computational cost and declining success with
increasing target size. We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks
(PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions
while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability.Guided by this
hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the
discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to
intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up
to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold,
enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and
ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline
that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima
and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence
patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework
for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise
inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis
as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.

Method: 针对推理开发整体或分区Transformer合成的方法和工具，以TrackFormers项目的两个跟踪机器学习模型设计为用例。

Result: 文中给出了初步结果。

Conclusion: 未明确提及结论，需后续根据初步结果分析开发的方法和工具效果。

Abstract: The Transformer Machine Learning (ML) architecture has been gaining
considerable momentum in recent years. In particular, computational High-Energy
Physics tasks such as jet tagging and particle track reconstruction (tracking),
have either achieved proper solutions, or reached considerable milestones using
Transformers. On the other hand, the use of specialised hardware accelerators,
especially FPGAs, is an effective method to achieve online, or pseudo-online
latencies. The development and integration of Transformer-based ML to FPGAs is
still ongoing and the support from current tools is very limited to
non-existent. Additionally, FPGA resources present a significant constraint.
Considering the model size alone, while smaller models can be deployed
directly, larger models are to be partitioned in a meaningful and ideally,
automated way. We aim to develop methodologies and tools for monolithic, or
partitioned Transformer synthesis, specifically targeting inference. Our
primary use-case involves two machine learning model designs for tracking,
derived from the TrackFormers project. We elaborate our development approach,
present preliminary results, and provide comparisons.

Abstract: High-Energy Physics experiments are rapidly escalating in generated data
volume, a trend that will intensify with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC
upgrade. This surge in data necessitates critical revisions across the data
processing pipeline, with particle track reconstruction being a prime candidate
for improvement. In our previous work, we introduced "TrackFormers", a
collection of Transformer-based one-shot encoder-only models that effectively
associate hits with expected tracks. In this study, we extend our earlier
efforts by incorporating loss functions that account for inter-hit
correlations, conducting detailed investigations into (various) Transformer
attention mechanisms, and a study on the reconstruction of higher-level
objects. Furthermore we discuss new datasets that allow the training on hit
level for a range of physics processes. These developments collectively aim to
boost both the accuracy, and potentially the efficiency of our tracking models,
offering a robust solution to meet the demands of next-generation high-energy
physics experiments.

Motivation: 解决代码执行数值结果预测这一因编程语言开放性带来的挑战任务，避免现有方法依赖大量特定领域特征工程的问题。

Method: 提出单一统一的回归语言模型（RLM），从文本直接进行预测。

Result: 相对小的300M参数RLM在APPS竞赛编程提交上Spearman-rank>0.9，在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman-rank>0.5，在经典NAS设计空间上Kendall-Tau达0.46并能预测多硬件平台架构延迟。

Conclusion: 单一统一的RLM能有效完成代码到指标回归任务，在多方面取得良好效果。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Motivation: 之前研究过transformer处理大量上下文标记的能力，此次为统一分析其表达能力，研究何种测度间映射是transformer。

Method: 通过对概率测度建模，考虑映射以概率分布表示的上下文为条件，分析测度间映射性质。

Result: 完全刻画了可通过前推由上下文映射表示的测度间映射性质，包括支持集基数不变、Fréchet导数正则部分一致连续；Vlasov方程解映射可由transformer近似；无限深度、平均场测度论transformer可与Vlasov流等同。

Conclusion: 明确了transformer作为测度间映射的性质，拓展了其在近似满足特定条件映射方面的应用。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Result: 和谐度低的基准可能给出误导性结果，如ARC - Easy受生物概念问题影响大。

Conclusion: 应将和谐度与准确率一同报告，使评估更稳健、可靠。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

Conclusion: 倡导更严格的基准构建，KGQAGen是推进KGQA评估的可扩展框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

Result: 在开放式价值冲突设置中，模型从支持保护类价值转向支持个人类价值；在系统提示中包含详细价值排序可使与目标排序的对齐度提高14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型的价值优先级很重要，为该领域未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

TL;DR: RLVR struggles in open - domain QA. The paper proposes TRM with sentence - level thinking supervision, which improves incorrect sentence identification and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR has challenges in open - domain question answering due to difficulty in verifying correctness, and existing work on faithfulness has drawbacks.

Method: Propose the Thinking - supervised Reward Model (TRM) that assesses answer sentence faithfulness and evaluates sentence - level correctness through reasoning steps.

Result: TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating it into policy optimization leads to gains in answer correctness and usefulness.

Conclusion: TRM can endow reward models with critical thinking abilities and effectively handle open - domain question answering by leveraging both external and internal knowledge.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入循环消融方法测试大语言模型中欺骗行为能否去除，发现欺骗行为有高恢复力且模型编辑会导致语言性能下降，凸显直接模型编辑的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型中欺骗等不良行为是可去除的局部功能，还是与核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 采用循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、目标消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT - 2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高恢复力，每次消融后通过对抗训练模型会恢复欺骗行为，且每次尝试模型编辑都会导致语言性能逐渐下降，困惑度上升。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式且相互纠缠的，直接通过机制解释进行模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在新闻报道任务中产生幻觉的情况，发现部分模型输出存在幻觉，提出新闻业特定的幻觉分类扩展及工具架构建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在新闻编辑室工作流程中使用增多，但产生幻觉的倾向给新闻核心实践带来风险，需评估其在新闻报道任务中的表现。

Method: 在与美国TikTok诉讼和政策相关的300篇文档语料的报道式任务中，评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM三个工具，改变提示特异性和上下文大小，用分类法标注句子级输出以衡量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出至少包含一处幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约为40%，是NotebookLM（13%）的约三倍；多数错误非虚构实体或数字，而是解释性过度自信。

Conclusion: 大语言模型与新闻业存在认识论上的根本不匹配，建议对现有幻觉分类法进行新闻业特定扩展，有效新闻工具需强制准确归因而非优化流畅性的架构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

Motivation: 构建一个能在降低法律风险的同时保证模型性能的开放预训练语料库。

Method: 采用风险缓解的资源策略，结合不同类型文本和数据，使用透明的多阶段管道进行处理，并公开数据集和处理方法。

Result: 在控制实验中，基于MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中表现优于其他许可数据集，在数学/代码任务上表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: 以许可优先、风险缓解的数据为基础训练大语言模型是可行的，可减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖且不损失竞争力。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型（LLM）置信度校准问题，提出Distractor - Normalized Coherence（DINCO）方法提升校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在校准问题，高置信度对应低准确率，影响信任和安全，需解决此问题。

Method: 验证LLM在低准确率声明上更易受暗示的假设，提出DINCO方法，通过模型在多个自生成干扰项上独立表达置信度并归一化，还结合生成器 - 验证器的不一致性。

Result: DINCO提供的置信度估计更不饱和、更可用，10次推理调用的DINCO性能优于100次的自一致性方法。

Conclusion: DINCO方法能有效提升LLM置信度校准效果。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

Motivation: 为在现实场景部署大语言模型，需进行开放式评估，受健康基准测试中模型自评提升推理性能启发。

Method: 引入基于自奖励评分标准的强化学习用于开放式推理的轻量级框架。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 32B上用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集训练的模型在HealthBench Hard上超GPT - 5，少量教师评分数据提升较弱模型性能。

Conclusion: 该轻量级框架训练更快、更省资源，效果超基线，少量教师评分数据有益。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

Motivation: 强化学习提升大语言模型推理能力的成果多局限于英语，不同语言间存在显著性能差异。

Method: 引入PB - RLSVR框架，以英语大语言模型为“枢轴”生成参考响应，基于语义等价性奖励多语言模型，研究多种跨语言语义奖励函数。

Result: 在多语言推理基准测试中显著缩小英语与其他语言的性能差距，大幅超越传统PPO基线，提升了Llama - 3.1 - 8B - Instruct和Qwen3 - 32B的平均多语言性能。

Conclusion: PB - RLSVR是构建真正多语言推理代理的强大且数据高效的方法。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下进行主观风格图像描述生成有困难，且获取偏好数据成本高，限制探索模型能力。

Method: 研究小视觉语言模型对齐幽默和浪漫风格的数据效率。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 有助于界定模型性能极限，确定实现风格饱和所需的最少偏好数据量，评估模型能力和局限。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合PEFT与MoE的方法多依赖传统TopK路由，需仔细调参且为每个token分配固定数量专家。

Method: 提出LD - MoLE，用可微路由函数和闭式解替代非可微TopK选择，使模型自适应确定各层每个token激活的专家数量，引入分析稀疏控制目标。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 1.7B和Llama - 3.2 - 3B模型上的大量实验表明，LD - MoLE在多种基准测试中平均得分最高。

Conclusion: LD - MoLE性能优越，能学习依赖token和层的专家分配。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

Conclusion: SimulRAG和UE+SBA能有效缓解幻觉问题，提高答案的信息性和事实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,

that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Motivation: 现有方法在优化大语言模型准确性和避免幻觉方面存在极端问题，难以保证真实性，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出TruthRL通用强化学习框架，用GRPO实现，采用三元奖励区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，与普通RL相比，TruthRL减少28.9%的幻觉，提高21.1%的真实性，不同骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: 基于真实性驱动的TruthRL在准确性和真实性上表现出色，学习目标设计对开发真实大语言模型很重要。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大推理模型“过度思考”问题，现有长度惩罚方案会导致性能下降。

Method: 发现当前长度奖励的两个缺陷，提出DECS框架，包括解耦的令牌级奖励机制和课程批量调度策略。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，DECS能减少超50%推理令牌，同时维持或提升性能。

Conclusion: 可在不损害模型推理能力的前提下提高推理效率。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Result: 在四个数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG 对所有任务和模型类型都有显著提升，准确率最高提升 9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG 是无需额外训练的通用框架，能在测试时提升推理能力，无需外部奖励模型。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

Motivation: 大语言模型在人类决策中影响渐大，此前研究未评估其在角色冲突这类模糊社会困境中的表现，需评估其情境敏感性。

Method: 引入RoleConflictBench，采用三阶段流程生成超13K个角色冲突场景，分析10个大语言模型的选择。

Result: 大语言模型对情境线索有一定反应能力，但不足，决策主要受社会角色固有偏差影响，分析量化了这些偏差。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在角色冲突的复杂社会困境中情境敏感性不够，决策受社会角色偏差主导。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

TL;DR: 提出评估文本个性化质量的高效方法PerQ，案例研究显示其可用性，减少资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，依赖大语言模型元评估有偏差且成本高。

Method: 引入名为PerQ的计算高效方法来评估给定文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过大小语言模型生成能力对比的案例研究，证明了所提指标在研究中的可用性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效减少资源浪费。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

Result: 在PolyHope数据集上表现有竞争力，宏观F1分数显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 有助于开发多语言细粒度希望言论检测模型，可用于加强积极内容审核和促进支持性在线社区。

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,
offering valuable insights for future research and development.

Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究多聚焦英语，中欧语言相关研究少，可迁移性未充分探索。

Method: 提供针对该地区的检测方法基准，对比训练语言组合，进行多领域、多生成器和多语言评估。

Result: 监督微调的中欧语言探测器在这些语言中性能最佳，且最抗混淆。

Conclusion: 监督微调探测器在中欧语言的机器生成文本检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展实时物流系统选择路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏场景中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型可用于为基于子图的归纳式链接预测的节点表示添加隐式类型信号，TyleR方法有效，代码已开源。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share
our code at https://github.com/sisinflab/tyler .

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂数据混合和反复实验以实现最优泛化，为解决这些挑战并简化训练过程。

Method: 通过对通用数据进行零学习率训练获得全局梯度，用于领域训练中的梯度提升和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅依赖领域数据的微调管道。

Result: 在多个流行基础模型的多个任务上，DBA联合性能比传统微调平均提高5.8%，减少了因数据混合导致的反复实验，相比传统方法减少91.0%的GPU小时数。

Conclusion: DBA方法是一种高效通用的大语言模型微调解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

Result: 分析了流行人类反馈数据集中鼓励的个性特征，以及流行模型展现这些特征的程度。

Conclusion: 发布了Feedback Forensics工具包、跟踪AI个性的网页应用和注释数据。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

Motivation: 现有KG - RAG系统存在推理成本高、依赖特定知识图谱的问题，需改进。

Method: 引入KG - R1框架，利用单一智能体与知识图谱交互，通过端到端强化学习优化。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用较小模型Qwen - 2.5 - 3B，比多模块工作流方法更准确且生成令牌更少，对新图谱无需修改也能保持高准确性。

Conclusion: KG - R1是有前景的适合实际部署的KG - RAG框架。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Method: 提出自适应规划框架PACO，将任务重构为用定制MCTS规划顺序的任务，节点代表摘要，动作对应单属性调整。

Result: 在不同领域和模型的大量实验中，PACO实现强大的多属性可控性，小模型版可与大模型基线匹敌，大模型时表现更优。

Conclusion: PACO在多属性可控摘要任务中是有效的解决方案，能有效满足约束条件。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Conclusion: OceanGym为开发强大的具身AI提供测试平台，推动其向实际水下自主航行器迁移，是迈向智能海洋探索的关键一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Result: 综合评估显示，最先进模型在跨场景任务成功率仅30%，其他任务不到50%。

Conclusion: VitaBench将为推进AI代理在实际应用中的发展提供有价值的资源。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Conclusion: 将对比解释的范围扩展到S2T，为更好地理解S2T模型提供了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

Motivation: 解决确保大语言模型在多种语言中实现类母语回复质量评估的难题。

Method: 引入MENLO框架，创建人工标注数据集，采用零样本评估、强化学习微调、奖励塑形和多任务学习等方法。

Result: 零样本LLM评判受益于成对评估和标注规则但仍不如人类，微调后有显著改进，RL训练的评判可作奖励模型但与人类判断有差距。

Conclusion: 为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有希望的方向，发布数据和框架支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 以往AI Scientist系统缺乏针对性，难以产生解决人类定义挑战的有价值科学贡献。

Method: 将发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，通过“假设、验证和分析”的分层评估过程实现，利用累积发现记忆平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超20000 GPU小时，生成约5000个独特科学想法，验证约1100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 首次提供AI在科学任务上逐步超越人类SOTA的大规模证据，推动科学发现前沿，将开源实验日志和系统代码。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

Motivation: 现有基准饱和，大语言模型自动创建基准虽可替代人工但存在关键缺陷。

Method: 对大语言模型自动基准测试进行研究，分析偏差来源和影响因素。

Result: 发现偏差源于测试数据和评估方法，受模型源语言生成能力影响，源文本多样性低是原因之一。

Conclusion: 提高生成源文本的多样性可缓解自偏差。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要有挑战性的测试数据，互联网上潜在主题众多，通过大量抽样评估所有主题找最难主题计算不可行。

Method: 将该任务形式化为多臂老虎机问题，每个主题是一个“臂”，拉臂意味着抽取单个示例、评估并测量难度，在固定计算预算内高效识别最难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略远胜暴力搜索等基线方法。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机策略能在固定计算预算内更有效地识别NLP模型测试数据中最难的主题。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

Motivation: 探究不同随机种子训练的语言模型的收敛性，明确影响模型训练中学习分布稳定性的因素。

Method: 测量不同种子下语言模型按预期每个标记的Kullback - Leibler（KL）散度，对比模型大小和训练检查点下的模型收敛情况。

Result: 发现四阶段收敛模式；大模型后期再收敛更快，小模型不收敛；不同语言类别收敛不均，高频词和功能词收敛更快更可靠。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了影响模型训练中学习分布稳定性的因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Motivation: 解决实际中精确预测器不可用时的关键挑战，为近似预测器建立稳定性保证。

Method: 分析可测输入和在线估计输入两种场景，证明稳定性；展示神经网络算子可实现任意小近似误差；进行数值实验。

Result: 可测输入情况证明半全局实际渐近稳定性，不可测输入情况证明局部实际渐近稳定性；数值实验验证理论，表明近似预测器下系统稳定，神经网络算子泛化能力强，计算速度最多快15倍。

Conclusion: 为非线性系统延迟自适应控制中近似预测器提供了有效稳定性保证，神经网络算子可满足相关条件，且有良好性能。

Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate
predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key
challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable.
We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable,
and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove
semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional
to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we
demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction
explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor
approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural
operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve
arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our
stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a
biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth
Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical
simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the
strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a
substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline
fixed-point method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因增强子的序列多样性和组织特异性使其在结直肠癌中难以定位，需要有效方法进行增强子分类。

Method: 微调DNABERT - 2模型，使用Johnston癌症研究中心的实验数据构建平衡语料库，进行数据处理和划分，用Optuna调整超参数训练模型。

Result: 模型达到PR - AUC 0.759、ROC - AUC 0.743等指标，相比CNN - based EnhancerNet有更强的阈值无关排序和更高召回率，但点准确率较低。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的基因组模型可超越基序水平编码进行调控元件的整体分类，为癌症基因组学提供新途径，下一步将提高精度等。

Abstract: Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence
diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal
cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer
genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length
tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre
at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1
kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous
de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data
stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen
empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned
hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached
PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold
(0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet
trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent
ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model
with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer,
demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals
directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that
transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward
holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for
cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid
CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to
strengthen real-world utility.

Result: 通过对代表性生物任务的实验分析，证明了scUnified的实用性。

Conclusion: scUnified为统一数据集上计算方法的标准化评估提供了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic
delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights
into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational
methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type
annotation, and marker gene identification. To fully assess and compare these
methods, standardized, analysis-ready datasets are essential. However, such
datasets remain scarce, and variations in data formats, preprocessing
workflows, and annotation strategies hinder reproducibility and complicate
systematic evaluation of existing methods. To address these challenges, we
present scUnified, an AI-ready standardized resource for single-cell RNA
sequencing data that consolidates 13 high-quality datasets spanning two species
(human and mouse) and nine tissue types. All datasets undergo standardized
quality control and preprocessing and are stored in a uniform format to enable
direct application in diverse computational analyses without additional data
cleaning. We further demonstrate the utility of scUnified through experimental
analyses of representative biological tasks, providing a reproducible
foundation for the standardized evaluation of computational methods on a
unified dataset.

Result: 在DAVIS和LVOS数据集上优于SOTA方法，在3D模型和文本到视频数据上验证了鲁棒性和兼容性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决视频草图动画生成中的问题，提高语义一致性和时间连贯性。

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

Conclusion: GaussEdit是强大的3D场景编辑工具，相比传统方法有显著改进。

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Conclusion: 3DiFACE方法有效解决了现有语音驱动3D面部动画的问题，能实现多样化动画生成与编辑。

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

Motivation: AI和XR生态存在差距，AI驱动的XR交互原型开发过程摩擦大，需手动集成不同系统。

Method: 提出XR Blocks跨平台框架，提供模块化架构和即插即用组件，基于WebXR、three.js等技术构建。

Result: 通过开源模板、示例和高级演示展示了XR Blocks的实用性。

Conclusion: XR Blocks可降低XR创作者的入门门槛，加速AI+XR应用的快速原型开发。

Abstract: We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality
(XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However,
a significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI
research and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and
benchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a
high-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate
disparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To
bridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to
accelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a
modular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI +
XR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is
designed with the mission of "reducing frictions from idea to reality", thus
accelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible
technologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the
barrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of
open-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to
quickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype. Site:

Abstract: This paper investigates the importance of personal ownership in musical AI
design, examining how practising musicians can maintain creative control over
the compositional process. Through a four-week ecological evaluation, we
examined how a music variation tool, reliant on the skill of musicians,
functioned within a composition setting. Our findings demonstrate that the
dependence of the tool on the musician's ability, to provide a strong initial
musical input and to turn moments into complete musical ideas, promoted
ownership of both the process and artefact. Qualitative interviews further
revealed the importance of this personal ownership, highlighting tensions
between technological capability and artistic identity. These findings provide
insight into how musical AI can support rather than replace human creativity,
highlighting the importance of designing tools that preserve the humanness of
musical expression.

Conclusion: 此方法是首个通用可迁移的DFT加速方法，发布的数据集和代码利于后续研究。

Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed
for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses
are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density
matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing
works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining
high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both
numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering
the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose
a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density
in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural
networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to
achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems
up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric
models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing
system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis
sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,
this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally
transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench
dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this
promising direction.

Method: 通过扩展量子化学计算的模型容量和训练数据，以中性H₂的键解离能预测作为泛化任务进行评估。

Result: 仅在稳定结构上训练的模型无法重现H₂能量曲线，最大的基础模型在简单双原子分子上有严重失败，无法重现基本的库仑定律。

Conclusion: 仅靠扩展规模不足以构建可靠的量子化学模型。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward
training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy
and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise
in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum
chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting
models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the
simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model
capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even
qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and
stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions
roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models
trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating
diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most
strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two
bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved
in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is
insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.

Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖原始视觉数据，希望利用更优的视觉表示提升自动驾驶轨迹规划效果。

Method: 提出BEV - VLM框架，利用多模态传感器数据融合生成BEV表示并与HD地图对齐，以其作为VLM的视觉输入进行轨迹规划。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，规划精度提升44.8%，且能完全避免碰撞。

Conclusion: VLMs能有效解释BEV特征等处理后的视觉表示，可拓展其在轨迹规划中除原始图像外的应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

Motivation: 解决基于流的策略在离线策略强化学习中因多步动作采样过程中的梯度问题导致的训练不稳定问题。

Method: 重新参数化速度网络，引入Flow - G和Flow - T两种稳定架构，开发基于SAC的实用算法，采用噪声增强的滚动策略进行端到端训练。

Result: 所提方法在连续控制和机器人操作基准测试中达到了SOTA性能，无需策略蒸馏或替代目标等常见变通方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决基于流的策略训练不稳定问题，支持从头学习和离线到在线学习。

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Motivation: 传统多机器人系统在未知室内环境的自主探索和目标搜索方法依赖贪婪边界分配策略，机器人间协调有限。

Method: 结合实时LiDAR扫描处理进行边界聚类提取和门口检测，利用多模态大语言模型（如GPT - 4o）基于共享环境地图和机器人状态生成协调的路径点分配。

Conclusion: LLM - MCoX框架在多机器人系统的自主探索和目标搜索中表现出色，能处理传统算法无法解释的语义指导。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的具身任务规划方法存在固定规划范式、缺乏动作序列约束和对错误不敏感的问题。

Method: 提出SDA - PLANNER，引入状态依赖图来显式建模动作前提条件和效果以指导动态修订，采用由错误回溯与诊断和自适应动作子树生成组成的错误自适应重新规划策略。

Result: 实验表明SDA - PLANNER在成功率和目标完成度上始终优于基线，尤其在不同错误条件下。

Conclusion: SDA - PLANNER能实现自适应规划范式、状态依赖感知和错误感知机制，有效提升具身任务规划效果。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

Motivation: 现有重定向管道难以处理人机体现差距，且忽视人与物体、环境的交互，需要改进。

Method: 引入基于交互网格的OmniRetarget，通过最小化拉普拉斯变形和执行运动学约束生成可行轨迹，同时保留任务相关交互以进行数据增强。

Conclusion: OmniRetarget能有效解决人机运动重定向问题，生成高质量数据训练机器人技能。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型用于放射分析时可靠性受临床成像随机噪声挑战，缺乏不同噪声类型对模型影响的系统跨任务理解。

Method: 使用新颖可扩展噪声注入框架，在公共数据集上对常见架构应用受控制、临床驱动的噪声强度进行实验。

Result: 语义分割模型易受影响，严重电子噪声下肺分割性能崩溃；分类任务总体更有韧性，但不同任务对不同噪声脆弱性有差异。

Conclusion: 分类模型有一定固有鲁棒性，像素级分割任务更脆弱，临床部署诊断AI前需针对性验证和缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly used for radiographic analysis, but
their reliability is challenged by the stochastic noise inherent in clinical
imaging. A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types
impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum
(Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks:
semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel,
scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated
noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet,
DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our
results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation
models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing
under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843),
signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks
demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform.
We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as
distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under
quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to
electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models
possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far
more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores
the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the
safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.

Method: 在简化的二维模拟变体中，使用带有基于分数的扩散模型形式的现代数据驱动图像先验的变分推理。

Result: 在合适的照明结构和强先验条件下，除最困难的成像场景外，即使存在测量噪声也能实现可靠且成功的图像重建。

Conclusion: 位置盲叠层成像在一定条件下可有效实现图像重建。

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

Conclusion: CAP - WAE是一种有效的糖尿病视网膜病变分级方法，能解决传统方法的问题。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

Motivation: 拉美教育系统碎片化、资源稀缺，了解公私校资源利用效率及驱动因素很关键，尤其是疫情带来学习危机后。

Method: 使用数据包络分析（DEA）评估不同类型学校的效率，用可解释机器学习方法（IML）估计效率的主要决定因素。

Result: 私立学校在认知和非认知维度效率略高，异质性低于公立学校。不同效率的公私校有不同决定因素。

Conclusion: 通过新方法分析了拉美公私学校效率差异及决定因素，为理解学校资源利用提供新证据。

Abstract: Latin America's education systems are fragmented and segregated, with
substantial differences by school type. The concept of school efficiency (the
ability of school to produce the maximum level of outputs given available
resources) is policy relevant due to scarcity of resources in the region.
Knowing whether private and public schools are making an efficient use of
resources -- and which are the leading drivers of efficiency -- is critical,
even more so after the learning crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, relying on data of 2,034 schools and nine Latin American countries
from PISA 2022, I offer new evidence on school efficiency (both on cognitive
and non-cognitive dimensions) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) by school
type and, then, I estimate efficiency leading determinants through
interpretable machine learning methods (IML). This hybrid DEA-IML approach
allows to accommodate the issue of big data (jointly assessing several
determinants of school efficiency). I find a cognitive efficiency gap of nearly
0.10 favouring private schools and of 0.045 for non-cognitive outcomes, and
with a lower heterogeneity in private than public schools. For cognitive
efficiency, leading determinants for the chance of a private school of being
highly efficient are higher stock of books and PCs at home, lack of engagement
in paid work and school's high autonomy; whereas low-efficient public schools
are shaped by poor school climate, large rates of repetition, truancy and
intensity of paid work, few books at home and increasing barriers for homework
during the pandemic.

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of

Conclusion: 揭示了多环境市场在分阶段、重叠实施时的边际效应和交互影响。

Abstract: To address the dual environmental challenges of pollution and climate change,
China has established multiple environmental markets, including pollution
emissions trading, carbon emissions trading, energy-use rights trading, and
green electricity trading. Previous empirical studies suffer from known biases
arising from time-varying treatment and multiple treatments. To address these
limitations, this study adopts a dynamic control group design and combines
Difference-in-Difference (DiD) and Artificial Counterfactual (ArCo) empirical
strategies. Using panel data on A-share listed companies from 2000 to 2024,
this study investigates the marginal effects and interactive impacts of
multiple environmental markets implemented in staggered and overlapping phases.
Existing pollution emissions trading mitigates the negative effects of carbon
emission trading. Carbon trading suppresses (improves) financial performance
(if implemented alongside energy-use rights trading). The addition of
energy-use rights or green electricity trading in regions already covered by
carbon or pollution markets has no significant effects.

Abstract: This paper examines whether monthly content creator earnings follow a power
law distribution, driven by compounding 'rich-get-richer' dynamics (Barabasi
and Albert 1999). Patreon creator earnings data for 2018, 2021, and 2024 for
Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon exhibit a power law
exponent around $\alpha = 2$. This suggests that algorithmic systems generate
unequalizing returns closer to highly concentrated capital income and wealth,
rather than labor income. Platforms governed by powerful and compounding
recommendation systems, such as Instagram and YouTube, exhibit both a stronger
power law relation (lower $\alpha$) and lower mean, median, and interquartile
earnings, indicating algorithms that disproportionately favor top earners at
the expense of a 'middle class' of creators. In contrast, Twitter and Patreon
have a more moderate $\alpha$, with less earnings inequality and higher middle
class earnings. Policies which incentivize the algorithmic promotion of
longer-tail content (to explore more and exploit less) may help creator
ecosystems become more equitable and sustainable.

Result: 储能运营商通过高低价套利影响市场表现，可改善供需不平衡和福利；竞争有限时策略性囤货会抬高价格、降低福利；扩大储能容量超过一定程度无更多收益；竞争能减轻市场扭曲，结果向社会规划者基准收敛。

Conclusion: 储能有稳定市场和形成市场势力的双重作用，需要设计使运营商激励与社会福利一致的市场设计。

Abstract: The transition to electricity systems powered entirely by renewable energy
sources makes energy storage indispensable for balancing intermittency and
ensuring reliability. Since RES operate at near-zero marginal cost, storage
operators can strongly influence electricity prices and energy security when
renewable supply alone cannot meet demand. We develop a Cournot competition
model in which storage operators strategically bid quantities to maximize their
profits. We propose a MILP model with the big-M method and reformulation using
continuous variables, incorporating demand blocks. The strategic bidding game
is solved using the diagonalization algorithm, and the social planner's problem
is used for benchmarking, cast as a one-shot optimization. The proposed model
is applied to Denmark's power system using current data and 2030 renewable
projections, capturing both current and future market conditions. Results show
that storage operators affect market performance by arbitrage between low-and
high-price periods, which can smooth supply-demand imbalances, thereby
improving welfare relative to the no-storage case. With limited competition,
however, strategic withholding increases prices and reduces welfare, while
expanding storage capacity beyond a certain point yields no further gains. As
the number of firms increases, competition mitigates distortions, and outcomes
converge toward the social planner's benchmark with only two to three strategic
players. These findings highlight storage's dual role in both stabilizing
markets and creating market power. underscoring the need for market designs
that align operators' incentives with social welfare.

Abstract: We propose an evolutionary model to study the transition toward green
technology under the influence of innovation. Clean and dirty technologies are
selected according to their profitability under an environmental tax, which
depends on the overall pollution level. Pollution itself evolves dynamically:
it results from the emissions of the two types of producers, naturally decays,
and is reduced through the implementation of the current abatement technology.
The regulator collects tax revenues and allocates them between the
implementation of the existing abatement technology and its innovation, which
increases the stock of knowledge and thereby enhances abatement effectiveness.
From a static perspective, we show the existence of steady states, both with
homogeneous populations of clean or dirty producers and with heterogeneous
populations where both technologies coexist. We discuss the mechanisms through
which these steady states emerge and how they may evolve into one another. From
a dynamical perspective, we characterize the resulting scenarios, showing how
innovation can foster a green transition if coupled with a suitable level of
taxation. At the same time, we investigate how improper environmental policies
may also produce unintended outcomes, such as environmental deterioration,
reversion to dirty technology, or economic unsustainability.

Result: 在大原子 - 自旋测试中表现好，应用于模型揭示新机制和多条路径，也适用于笛卡尔原子

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，能有效解决复杂系统状态转变相关问题

Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping
the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state
networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and
enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and
physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples
only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization
framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a
multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer
uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest
k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1
saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based
pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large
atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak
memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized
N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously
unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type
skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up
to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same
core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical
rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in characterizing the function
spaces underlying neural networks. While shallow and deep scalar-valued neural
networks have been linked to scalar-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces
(RKBS), $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operator models remain less
understood in the RKBS setting. To address this gap, we develop a general
definition of vector-valued RKBS (vv-RKBS), which inherently includes the
associated reproducing kernel. Our construction extends existing definitions by
avoiding restrictive assumptions such as symmetric kernel domains,
finite-dimensional output spaces, reflexivity, or separability, while still
recovering familiar properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (vv-RKHS). We then show that shallow $\R^d$-valued neural networks are
elements of a specific vv-RKBS, namely an instance of the integral and neural
vv-RKBS. To also explore the functional structure of neural operators, we
analyze the DeepONet and Hypernetwork architectures and demonstrate that they
too belong to an integral and neural vv-RKBS. In all cases, we establish a
Representer Theorem, showing that optimization over these function spaces
recovers the corresponding neural architectures.

Method: 提出二分法解决静态优化问题，将方法扩展为收缩视野算法解决顺序问题，该算法通过基于观测需求值更新未来需求分布来计算未来分配。

Result: 在联合对数正态需求的简单合成示例中，算法性能接近解决预知问题得到的界限。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在解决随机需求下资源分配问题上有较好表现。

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally allocating a limited number of resources
across time to maximize revenue under stochastic demands. This formulation is
relevant in various areas of control, such as supply chain, ticket revenue
maximization, healthcare operations, and energy allocation in power grids. We
propose a bisection method to solve the static optimization problem and extend
our approach to a shrinking horizon algorithm for the sequential problem. The
shrinking horizon algorithm computes future allocations after updating the
distribution of future demands by conditioning on the observed values of
demand. We illustrate the method on a simple synthetic example with jointly
log-normal demands, showing that it achieves performance close to a bound
obtained by solving the prescient problem.

Motivation: MILP问题是NP难问题，计算挑战大，现有生成模型存在只对整数变量分布建模、未考虑变量耦合的局限，需新方法加速求解。

Method: 提出FMIP框架对整数和连续变量联合分布建模，设计整体引导机制在推理过程中优化解。

Result: 在八个标准MILP基准测试中，FMIP表现优于现有基线，平均减少41.34%的原始差距。

Conclusion: FMIP完全兼容任意骨干网络和各种下游求解器，适合广泛的现实MILP应用。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a foundational tool for complex
decision-making problems. However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a
significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine
learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While
recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics,
they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of
only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between
integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and
ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint
Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is
the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both
integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint
modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the
generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and
feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight
standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against
existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average. Moreover, we
show that FMIP is fully compatible with arbitrary backbone networks and various
downstream solvers, making it well-suited for a broad range of real-world MILP
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有桥接模型在语音增强任务中局限于单任务或小规模数据集，通用语音恢复能力受限。

Method: 将语音波形压缩为连续潜在表示，用可扩展的Transformer架构进行单一潜在到潜在的生成过程；提出能量保留变分自编码器；提出联合神经先验；设计感知感知微调阶段。

Result: 在域内和域外任务及数据集上验证了VoiceBridge的优越性能。

Conclusion: VoiceBridge在通用语音恢复方面表现出色，能有效从各种失真中重建高保真语音。

Abstract: Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such
as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are
typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained
general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we
introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs),
capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,}
48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into
continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse
LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a
single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer
architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data
domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational
autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over
varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ
reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint
neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last,
considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a
perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading
mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive
validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets
(\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation
results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge. Demo samples can

Conclusion: 所提架构及决策模块在处理音乐关系、生成连贯音轨方面有一定有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the
field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the
tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a
real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of
separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision
module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such
musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture
employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception
module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We
present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce
learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our
decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its
corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音情感识别在测试时易受分布偏移影响，测试时间自适应方法有局限性。

Method: 提出Emo - TTA框架，通过期望最大化程序增量更新类条件统计量，以音频语言模型预测为先验，对单个测试样本操作且不修改模型权重。

Result: 在六个跨领域语音情感识别基准测试中，相比先前的测试时间自适应基线有一致的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 统计自适应能有效使模型预测与不断变化的测试分布对齐。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains
vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance
degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a
promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning,
limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight,
training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional
statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time
distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on
individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six
out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior
TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in
aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.

Motivation: 现有音乐格式复杂或结构不一致，不适合基于标记的学习架构，需新记谱系统。

Method: 提出基于十六进制的HNote记谱系统，将12300首江南风格歌曲从YNote转换为HNote，用LoRA微调LLaMA - 3.1(8B)。

Result: HNote句法正确率达82.5%，BLEU和ROUGE评估显示有强符号和结构相似性，生成风格连贯的作品。

Conclusion: HNote是结合大语言模型与文化音乐建模的有效框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new
opportunities for symbolic music generation. However, existing formats such as
MIDI, ABC, and MusicXML are either overly complex or structurally inconsistent,
limiting their suitability for token-based learning architectures. To address
these challenges, we propose HNote, a novel hexadecimal-based notation system
extended from YNote, which encodes both pitch and duration within a fixed
32-unit measure framework. This design ensures alignment, reduces ambiguity,
and is directly compatible with LLM architectures. We converted 12,300
Jiangnan-style songs generated from traditional folk pieces from YNote into
HNote, and fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1(8B) using parameter-efficient LoRA.
Experimental results show that HNote achieves a syntactic correctness rate of
82.5%, and BLEU and ROUGE evaluations demonstrate strong symbolic and
structural similarity, producing stylistically coherent compositions. This
study establishes HNote as an effective framework for integrating LLMs with
cultural music modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频大语言模型在空间推理上依赖无结构双耳线索和单步推理，限制了感知准确性和可解释推理能力，现有工作存在分辨率和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 引入SAGE编码器对齐双耳声学特征与3D空间结构，提出OWL模型集成SAGE和空间链式思维，通过课程学习，构建BiDepth数据集用于训练和评估。

Result: 在BiDepth和SpatialSoundQA数据集上，OWL通过SAGE减少平均到达方向误差11°，空间推理问答准确率比BAT最多提高25%。

Conclusion: 所提出的SAGE编码器和OWL模型在音频空间推理任务上有效，能提升性能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio
large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and
single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and
distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work
such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on
coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit
geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the
$\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio
encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using
panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while
requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present
$\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially
grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and
distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to
multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA
estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and
release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining
binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across
both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new
$\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean
DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves
spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.

Conclusion: 明确了当前说话人分割模型的性能情况和主要错误来源。

Abstract: Speaker diarization is the task of partitioning audio into segments according
to speaker identity, answering the question of "who spoke when" in
multi-speaker conversation recordings. While diarization is an essential task
for many downstream applications, it remains an unsolved problem. Errors in
diarization propagate to downstream systems and cause wide-ranging failures. To
this end, we examine exact failure modes by evaluating five state-of-the-art
diarization models, across four diarization datasets spanning multiple
languages and acoustic conditions. The evaluation datasets consist of 196.6
hours of multilingual audio, including English, Mandarin, German, Japanese, and
Spanish. Overall, we find that PyannoteAI achieves the best performance at
11.2% DER, while DiariZen provides a competitive open-source alternative at
13.3% DER. When analyzing failure cases, we find that the primary cause of
diarization errors stem from missed speech segments followed by speaker
confusion, especially in high-speaker count settings.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become the state of the art across multiple
domains, from natural language processing to machine listening, thanks to
attention mechanisms. However, the attention layers require a large number of
parameters and high-end hardware for both training and inference. We propose a
novel pruning technique targeted explicitly at the attention mechanism, where
we decouple the pruning of the four layers in the attention block, namely:
query, keys, values and outputs' projection matrices. We also investigate
pruning strategies to prune along the head and channel dimensions, and compare
the performance of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model under
different pruning scenarios. Our results show that even by pruning 50\% of the
attention parameters we incur in performance degradation of less than 1\%

self-supervised audio representations to identify common data quality issues,
creating ranked review lists that surface distinct issues within a single,

Abstract: Interpretability is essential for deploying deep learning models in symbolic

explanation. To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that
helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing
clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual
explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that
alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically
coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to
the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We
evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive
insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.

both full-ensemble and subset singer separation scenarios, outperforming
spectrogram-based baselines while generalizing to realistic mixtures with
varying numbers of singers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波频谱存在严重信道衰落，多数优化算法依赖准确信道状态信息（CSI），而RIS多为无源组件，CSI获取困难。

Method: 利用接收导频信号提供的隐式CSI，采用无监督学习技术，提出Capacity - Net建立接收导频信号、优化的RIS相移和可达速率之间的映射。

Conclusion: Capacity - Net无监督学习方法能有效解决RIS辅助毫米波MIMO系统中因CSI获取困难导致的优化问题，提升系统可达速率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

Motivation: 联合优化发射机预编码和RIS相移矩阵以最大化频谱效率，且考虑RIS元件实际耦合效应。

Method: 提出基于深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）的深度强化学习（DRL）框架。

Result: 在实际毫米波信道设置下，在固定和随机用户数量场景中评估，DDPG方法显著优于基于优化的算法和双深度Q学习，尤其在随机用户分布场景。

Conclusion: 尽管复杂，但所提DDPG方法在提升频谱效率上表现出色。

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

TL;DR: 当前大音频语言模型评估忽视文化特色线索，本文提出TAU基准测试，实验表明现有模型表现不如当地人，凸显本地化基准的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大音频语言模型评估多关注语音或全球通用声音，忽略文化特色线索，需探究模型对本地化非语义音频的泛化能力。

Method: 构建TAU基准，通过结合精选资源、人工编辑和大语言模型辅助生成问题的流程，制作702个音频片段和1794个选择题。

Result: 包括Gemini 2.5和Qwen2 - Audio在内的先进大音频语言模型表现远低于当地人类。

Conclusion: 需要本地化基准来揭示文化盲点，指导更公平的多模态评估，确保模型服务于全球主流之外的群体。

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations
emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive
cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to
localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but
outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),
a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline
combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,
producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by
transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including
Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates
the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more
equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the
global mainstream.

Motivation: 对话口语语言模型在时间动态能力方面存在未评估的关键挑战，影响对话流畅性，需要进行评估。

Method: 引入Game - Time基准，包含基本指令跟随任务和有时间约束的高级任务。

Result: 不同SLM架构性能有差异，先进模型基本任务表现好，但多数系统基本指令跟随有困难，几乎所有模型在时间约束下性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: Game - Time基准为开发更具时间感知能力的对话AI研究提供基础。

Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising
paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal
dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous
speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational
fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework
to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans
learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic
instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such
as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM
architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art
models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with
fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade
substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in
time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a
foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware
conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website

Result: 在实验室和现实基准中分别提升检测准确率39%和57%，表明改进数据集比选大模型更重要。

Conclusion: 科学界应加大综合数据收集投入，而非仅训练大模型。

Abstract: While the technologies empowering malicious audio deepfakes have dramatically
evolved in recent years due to generative AI advances, the same cannot be said
of global research into spoofing (deepfake) countermeasures. This paper
highlights how current deepfake datasets and research methodologies led to
systems that failed to generalize to real world application. The main reason is
due to the difference between raw deepfake audio, and deepfake audio that has
been presented through a communication channel, e.g. by phone. We propose a new
framework for data creation and research methodology, allowing for the
development of spoofing countermeasures that would be more effective in
real-world scenarios. By following the guidelines outlined here we improved
deepfake detection accuracy by 39% in more robust and realistic lab setups, and
by 57% on a real-world benchmark. We also demonstrate how improvement in
datasets would have a bigger impact on deepfake detection accuracy than the
choice of larger SOTA models would over smaller models; that is, it would be
more important for the scientific community to make greater investment on
comprehensive data collection programs than to simply train larger models with
higher computational demands.

Motivation: 大语言模型发展为具备工具使用能力的自主代理后带来超越传统内容安全的挑战。

Method: 提出STAC攻击框架，自动生成并评估483个案例，设计闭环管道，进行防御分析。

Result: 最先进的LLM代理高度易受STAC攻击，现有基于提示的防御保护有限，新防御提示可将攻击成功率降低28.8%。

Conclusion: 防御具备工具使用能力的代理需要对整个行动序列及其累积效应进行推理。

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

Result: 方法对各类PII相关任务平均拒绝率达93.3%，对无关模型性能影响小，且在不同条件下适应性好。

Conclusion: 提出的概念引导缓解方法能有效高效地让VLMs拒绝PII敏感任务，具有适应性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in processing and reasoning over diverse modalities, but their
advanced abilities also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly
regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. While relevant
research has been conducted on single-modal language models to some extent, the
vulnerabilities in the multimodal setting have yet to be fully investigated. In
this work, we investigate these emerging risks with a focus on vision language
models (VLMs), a representative subclass of MLLMs that covers the two
modalities most relevant for PII leakage, vision and text. We introduce a
concept-guided mitigation approach that identifies and modifies the model's
internal states associated with PII-related content. Our method guides VLMs to
refuse PII-sensitive tasks effectively and efficiently, without requiring
re-training or fine-tuning. We also address the current lack of multimodal PII
datasets by constructing various ones that simulate real-world scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that the method can achieve an average refusal
rate of 93.3% for various PII-related tasks with minimal impact on unrelated
model performances. We further examine the mitigation's performance under
various conditions to show the adaptability of our proposed method.

Motivation: 大语言模型易受提示注入攻击，以往方法存在易受自适应攻击或无法用于最先进模型的问题。

Result: 通过多个案例研究评估，利用该方法的设计能系统防止提示注入攻击并保持高实用性。

Conclusion: 类型导向权限分离方法可有效防止大语言模型的提示注入攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their
ability to interact with unstructured content. As such, LLMs are now a key
driver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents.
Unfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt
injections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended
functionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors
and finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to
adaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we
propose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that
systematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to
interact with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set
of data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and
content, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections. We evaluate our
method across several case studies and find that designs leveraging our
principles can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while
maintaining high utility.

Abstract: Integrating SDN and the IoT enhances network control and flexibility.
DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in
SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly
degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of
adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT
environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model
and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model,
and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate
white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets.
Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by
up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&W
and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training
enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time
deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures,
including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and
explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat
models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack
categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous
research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD
models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience,
interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a
foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance
DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial
threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical
studies.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型指纹识别方法基于训练动态等，本文提出更强更内在的指纹识别概念。

Method: 提出SeedPrints方法，利用随机初始化偏差作为持久的、依赖种子的标识符，通过统计检测方法恢复模型谱系。

Result: 在多种模型实验中，SeedPrints实现种子级可区分性，能进行全生命周期身份验证，在实际场景也有效。

Conclusion: 初始化能在神经语言模型上留下独特持久身份，形成真正的“高尔顿式”指纹。

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Conclusion: DeepProv不仅能提升模型鲁棒性，还具有在隐私审计和公平性分析等其他关键领域表征DNN行为的潜力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes
applications, from self-driving cars to biometric authentication. However,
their unpredictable and unreliable behaviors in real-world settings require new
approaches to characterize and ensure their reliability.
  This paper introduces DeepProv, a novel and customizable system designed to
capture and characterize the runtime behavior of DNNs during inference by using
their underlying graph structure. Inspired by system audit provenance graphs,
DeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process
through Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed
structural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and
structural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs
for specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.
  We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model
repair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our
results demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse
classification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv
automatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs,
significantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying
DeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average
55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements
existing defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness.
Beyond robustness, we demonstrate the broader potential of DeepProv as an
adaptable system to characterize DNN behavior in other critical areas, such as
privacy auditing and fairness analysis.

Conclusion: 鼓励指纹设计者从设计上考虑对抗鲁棒性，并给出未来指纹方法的建议。

Abstract: Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model
ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused
on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and
prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness}
against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge
this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model
fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting
schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we
develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and
demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten
recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the
model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt
adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future
fingerprinting methods.

Conclusion: 在数字环境下，文化遗产问题不仅涉及保存和传承，还包括媒体呈现、机器创造力和解释误差等，需关注记忆过程和空间的塑造因素。

Abstract: "Quantum est in libris" explores the intersection of the archaic and the
modern. On one side, there are manuscript materials from the Estonian National
Museum's (ERM) more than century-old archive describing the life experiences of
Estonian people; on the other side, there is technology that transforms these
materials into a dynamic and interactive experience. Connecting technology and
cultural heritage is the visitor, who turns texts into inputs for a screen
sculpture.
  Historical narratives are visually brought to life through the contemporary
technological language. Because the video AI models we employed, Runway Gen-3
and Gen-4, have not previously interacted with Estonian heritage, we can
observe how machines today "read the world" and create future heritage.
"Quantum est in libris" introduces an exciting yet unsettling new dimension to
the concept of cultural heritage: in a world where data are fluid and
interpretations unstable, heritage status becomes fragile. In the digital
environment, heritage issues are no longer just about preservation and
transmission, but also about representation of the media, machine creativity,
and interpretive error. Who or what shapes memory processes and memory spaces,
and how?

Conclusion: QMC方法在计算有意义的感兴趣量期望方面可能成功，对数正态随机场结果促使进一步理论发展。

Abstract: We study the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of
semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations used to
model tumor growth. Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely
phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into
surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient
response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable
inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and
noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant
uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can
be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest
(QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that
QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs.
Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a
theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical
linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is
verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for
lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.

Motivation: 解决SEMs估计中有限样本偏差的问题，现有方法各有优缺点，需寻找更好的解决方案。

Method: 将RBM框架应用于SEMs，通过广泛的模拟研究评估其效果。

Result: RBM估计器能持续减少SEMs估计中的平均偏差，不增加均方误差，在中位数偏差和推断方面优于最大似然估计器，且在非正态条件下保持稳健性。

Conclusion: RBM为缓解SEMs估计中的偏差提供了有前景、实用且广泛适用的工具，尤其适用于小样本研究。

Abstract: Finite-sample bias is a pervasive challenge in the estimation of structural
equation models (SEMs), especially when sample sizes are small or measurement
reliability is low. A range of methods have been proposed to improve
finite-sample bias in the SEM literature, ranging from analytic bias
corrections to resampling-based techniques, with each carrying trade-offs in
scope, computational burden, and statistical performance. We apply the
reduced-bias M-estimation framework (RBM, Kosmidis & Lunardon, 2024, J. R.
Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol.) to SEMs. The RBM framework is attractive
as it requires only first- and second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood,
which renders it both straightforward to implement, and computationally more
efficient compared to resampling-based alternatives such as bootstrap and
jackknife. It is also robust to departures from modelling assumptions. Through
extensive simulations studies under a range of experimental conditions, we
illustrate that RBM estimators consistently reduce mean bias in the estimation
of SEMs without inflating mean squared error. They also deliver improvements in
both median bias and inference relative to maximum likelihood estimators, while
maintaining robustness under non-normality. Our findings suggest that RBM
offers a promising, practical, and broadly applicable tool for mitigating bias
in the estimation of SEMs, particularly in small-sample research contexts.

Abstract: We consider the problem of fully Bayesian posterior estimation and
uncertainty quantification in undirected Gaussian graphical models via Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) under recently-developed element-wise graphical
priors, such as the graphical horseshoe. Unlike the conjugate Wishart family,
these priors are non-conjugate; but have the advantage that they naturally
allow one to encode a prior belief of sparsity in the off-diagonal elements of
the precision matrix, without imposing a structure on the entire matrix.
Unfortunately, for a graph with $p$ nodes and with $n$ samples, the
state-of-the-art MCMC approaches for the element-wise priors achieve a per
iteration complexity of $O(p^4),$ which is prohibitive when $p\gg n$. In this
regime, we develop a suitably reparameterized MCMC with per iteration
complexity of $O(p^3)$, providing a one-order of magnitude improvement, and
consequently bringing the computational cost at par with the conjugate Wishart
family, which is also $O(p^3)$ due to a use of the classical Bartlett
decomposition, but this decomposition does not apply outside the Wishart
family. Importantly, the proposed benefit is obtained solely due to our
reparameterization in an MCMC scheme targeting the true posterior, that
reverses the recently developed telescoping block decomposition of Bhadra et
al. (2024), in a suitable sense. There is no variational or any other
approximate Bayesian computation scheme considered in this paper that
compromises targeting the true posterior. Simulations and the analysis of a
breast cancer data set confirm both the correctness and better algorithmic
scaling of the proposed reverse telescoping sampler.

Abstract: Average and conditional treatment effects are fundamental causal quantities
used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in various critical
applications, including clinical settings and policy-making. Beyond the
gold-standard estimators from randomized trials, numerous methods have been
proposed to estimate treatment effects using observational data. In this paper,
we provide a novel characterization of widely used causal inference techniques
within the framework of staged event trees, demonstrating their capacity to
enhance treatment effect estimation. These models offer a distinct advantage
due to their interpretability, making them particularly valuable for practical
applications. We implement classical estimators within the framework of staged
event trees and illustrate their capabilities through both simulation studies
and real-world applications. Furthermore, we showcase how staged event trees
explicitly and visually describe when standard causal assumptions, such as
positivity, hold, further enhancing their practical utility.

TL;DR: 论文介绍EnScale生成式机器学习框架用于气候数据降尺度，降低计算成本且表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球环流模型（GCMs）空间分辨率粗需降尺度，区域气候模型（RCMs）计算成本高，现有生成式方法难以准确建模。

Method: 提出EnScale框架，先调整GCM与粗化RCM数据的大规模不匹配，再进行超分辨率步骤生成高分辨率场，两步均使用基于能量评分优化的生成式模型。

Result: 与现有ML降尺度方法相比，降低约一个数量级的计算成本，能联合模拟多个变量，提出EnScale - t实现时间一致的降尺度。

Conclusion: EnScale是准确且时间一致的RCM模拟的有前景方法。

Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation
models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring
downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs)
provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this
issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping
coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative
approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given
coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus
challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine
learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on
multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale
mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution
step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models
optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to
state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational
cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple
variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially
consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant
EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a
comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including
calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies.
Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance
and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate
and temporally consistent RCM emulation.

Motivation: 解决现有AI事件数据库忽视资本市场异常，尤其是算法和高频交易异常的问题，应对AI系统不透明带来的系统性风险。

Method: 提出监管级全球数据库，结合交易后报告框架与医疗和航空的事件记录模型，采用时间数据省略技术，用合成数据验证。

Conclusion: 该解决方案能为监管者、金融机构和投资者提供帮助，呼吁立即行动加强风险管理，通过提高透明度和协调监督促进全球金融稳定。

Abstract: "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As
Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital
markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According
to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked
to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database
exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on
crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market
anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address
this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that
elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident
documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal
data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based
metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks
while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation
(modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals
compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries,
market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms,
and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading
behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers
regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial
institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical
visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for
immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in
AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven
systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced
transparency and coordinated oversight.

Method: 提出Sandbox Configurator模块化开源框架，用户可从共享库选测试，生成定制沙箱环境，支持多种模块。

Result: 框架可满足不同利益相关者需求，如为CAs提供工作流程、助技术专家集成评估方法等。

Conclusion: Sandbox Configurator可促进跨境合作与标准化，支持欧洲可信AI治理基础设施建设。

Abstract: The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these
technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial
Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised
environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent
Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for
startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are
fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers
and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox
Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select
domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox
environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to
support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of
interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple
stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations;
technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers
access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border
collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to
support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for
trustworthy AI governance.

Abstract: Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as
plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate
execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement,
and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in
graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce
AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a
unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and
gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While
existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes
on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically
generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high
question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive
questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty,
plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework
advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path
to produce genuinely skilled graduates.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping educational practice,
challenging long held assumptions about teaching and learning. This article
integrates conceptual perspectives from recent books (Genesis by Eric Schmidt,
Henry Kissinger and Craig Mundie, CoIntelligence by Ethan Mollick, and The
Inevitable by Kevin Kelly) with empirical insights from popular AI podcasts and
Anthropic public releases. We examine seven key domains: emotional support,
creativity, contextual understanding, student engagement, problem solving,
ethics and morality, and collaboration. For each domain, we explore AI
capabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best
practices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world
observations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement
and enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across
cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet
responsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI
integration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning,
collaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values.

Method: 使用DeepSeek生成2943名虚拟参与者，与CFPS2018人口分布匹配，对比七个中国地区真实与模拟参与者在大五人格和主观幸福感上的表现。

Result: 真实与模拟数据集有广泛相似性，尤其在区域差异趋势上；但也有系统差异，如模拟参与者在外向性和开放性上得分低，宜人性和神经质得分高，幸福感低；预测结构也不同。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能近似人群层面的心理分布，但对文化特定和情感维度表现不足，强调了丰富训练数据和改进情感建模的必要性。

Abstract: This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded
psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we
generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from
the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality
traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was
measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a
single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and
simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However,
systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in
extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and
consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged:
while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as
positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness,
with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while
LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they
underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings
highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants
for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally
enriched training data and improved affective modeling.

Result: 模型间变异性高，与模型开发国家的政治文化有强关联。

Conclusion: 需要对AI系统中嵌入的社会政治维度进行更详细的研究。

Abstract: Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting
distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies,
ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human
societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those
societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents
trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political
assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent
with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through
experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed
across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and
political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring
and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high
model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture
of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the
need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded
within AI systems.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for
connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources,
promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web
and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains
uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by
placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and
privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients
converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing
designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the
MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement
framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a
14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid
projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that
more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face
structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and
that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns.
Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP
ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.

positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed
willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun
integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is
uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently,
others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common
AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used.
Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency

Abstract: The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across
society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these
technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large
companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases,
enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature
documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance,
while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI
policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this
context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences
across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create
a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers
able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students
for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a
key priority for the CS curriculum.
  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating
discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.
We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and
European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class
discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS
courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy
demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation
and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore
represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions
across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare
AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences.

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Abstract: As personalized learning gains increasing attention in mathematics education,
there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that can assess complex
student responses and provide individualized feedback in real time. In this
study, we present a personalized auto-grading and feedback system for
constructive geometry tasks, developed using large language models (LLMs) and
deployed on the Algeomath platform, a Korean online tool designed for
interactive geometric constructions. The proposed system evaluates
student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural
accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading
mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared
through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on
teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it
dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to
four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79
middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were
benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers,
and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step
geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term
transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential
of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in
mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and
feedback design.
